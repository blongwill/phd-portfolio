[1/1000]	i did . she did . the same question came to mind , and i hesitated . " yes , " i said . " how old are you ? " i thought it odd that i 'd never
[2/1000]	i 'd assumed that was why the last night had felt so intimate , because being alone with him had seemed so private . yet here he was looking at me , like he had all the time in the
[3/1000]	" yes . but do you look like he would forget everything he knew about you in a second ? " she asked . " not in a hurry . " " maybe he will . you 'll

[7/1000]	" sure thing . " " i have to call the detective , " danny said . " thanks for the tea . " " please do . call me tomorrow , though . maybe i 'll have
[8/1000]	he held up a gloved hand and motioned me to go ahead . " i found a place . " i felt like i was going to vomit as i followed that finger down the passageway , which i
[9/1000]	" it 's not about getting to know your father , you know . " " of course it is n't . " " and you wo n't kiss max . " " i ca n't kiss
[10/1000]	' how does this deal work ? ' he said . he was making her worry . he shook his head at her . ' my fault ; of course i 'm gon na break your heart .
[11/1000]	" the three of us are leaving . " " oh , you mean gage . " i look away . " skyla , " marshall says it with a serious demeanor . " we are leaving .
[12/1000]	she dropped her hands to her side , crossed her arms and said , " you have no evidence to support your contention . " " why on earth do you have two kids ? " " because
[13/1000]	" we 're in trouble , " he said nervously . " somebody should deal with that . " " no , sir . there 's no need . " there was some time before dinner <EOS> just
[14/1000]	the man , who had been struggling with whether or not to respond to his message , blinked and turned to his companions . they all looked at him expectantly . his lips moved with a smile . "
[15/1000]	a woman said , " let 's go inside . in here , the temperature is much lower . " then she walked away and returned just in time to let the women in through the front door .
[16/1000]	" i 'd see more . " " why are we wasting time ? " connor asks . she shrugs again . " i have no idea . but i never want to see the look on your
[17/1000]	" because he wants to say good - bye to you and you 're his wife . it would be nice to get it over with now . " " we are n't going out , " she said
[18/1000]	" yes . " i smiled , and sat . as he pulled the car into the spot back in the garage , i called back over my shoulder , " i know that for as long as i
[19/1000]	i nodded . " i 'll call lucas tomorrow . " " it 's not that simple . " " if you say so . i 'm going on a date . " anna 's jaw dropped
[20/1000]	i do n't realize i 'm staring at the tattoo until someone slaps me in the back of the head , hard . a loud ringing echoes in my ears . the person behind my back has stepped a
[21/1000]	" you should know better . " " but you do n't ? " " let 's not go there , shall we ? do you want to see who your partner 's girlfriend is , or not
[22/1000]	" i 'm not having sex with any man if i ca n't get off with him , " she mumbled . " that 's not what i hear . " " i mean it , noah .
[23/1000]	it seems pretty important to move forward . " " go on . i 'll be there in a minute . just like this is a damn museum . " " there appears to have been an explosion
[24/1000]	the second time was even worse , as a very old , very hurt man had said . the girl in the car started screaming so loudly her ears hurt and the car was shaking in the high spots of
[25/1000]	i shrugged and rubbed my eyes . " sorry to disappoint you . " he laughed and winked . " then how do you think he wanted to know what you could do ? " i rolled my
[26/1000]	why ? what had gotten into him ? then what . he moved to her and settled in the chair at her desk as he lifted his legs under the table . when their eyes met , he shook
[27/1000]	" that 's bullshit . " " then what does she do out here ? " " she writes . " " no shit ? " " fuck you . " " you want to
[28/1000]	" i thought , " said justin , " that you would have come , of course . " " well , i 'm glad i did when i heard about what happened , " she protested . "
[29/1000]	" yes sir . there was a man on the phone . he said he wanted to meet us and i know he meant me . i ... i was really upset . " i looked up into my father
[30/1000]	" he 's been trying to contact your sister , " i say . " i can assure you she 's not answering her cell . he says he 'll try again when he leaves . " " your
[31/1000]	" do you know your whereabouts ? " " you mean you do n't know where you are ? " " i do and the answer is yes . " " that 's good . just find
[32/1000]	i stood up and started running as i heard him yelling . " keep running , chase ! " i moved around a corner to find the man coming after me . i ran out onto the street ,
[33/1000]	" is it all right if i sit with you ? " " of course . i want you to . and - " her knees went weak . it was as if a hand had seized her ankles
[34/1000]	" i will not hold back . " she laughed , but shook her head , already pulling him in for a kiss . " in the morning , we have an apartment to pick up , " she
[35/1000]	well , not all of the players were guilty of what happened with their families . the news media did n't find it funny at all , but at least they appeared to have stopped crying and now could eat
[36/1000]	" he 's right , " dad adds almost reluctantly . " i do n't think you should be involved with her today . " " of course . but i 'm willing to do the right thing .
[37/1000]	the bell rang and drew the students to go out . i felt sad that we had n't had a chance to speak before the bell rang for lunch . " i 'm going to go talk to him
[38/1000]	my eyes slid to my boots , remembering the last time i 'd pulled up at the beach , feeling the crisp breeze tug on my loose hair , the soft feel of the sand under my bare bottom feet
[39/1000]	i 'd like to tell you it was n't that bad , " replied nathan , chuckling . " seriously , i think we had fun . " " you bet your ass , " said kristie .
[40/1000]	there was n't any need while my family was in town . i knew no one here , so i 'd have time to catch up . as soon as i 'd gathered my composure i pushed the bike away
[41/1000]	" ' tis not a reason , " ber wyn says again . " she was a sweet daughter of a king 's bitch , after all . " i close my eyes . a gentle breeze blows my
[42/1000]	" i know i should be jealous when he turns you into the queen that you are but i was n't , he wanted to have a baby with you and he was acting out because he wanted you to
[43/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " she blurted out . " you said something in the store . why do i think that ? " lauren shook her head . " it was n't about you
[44/1000]	" actually , when they come in , they both turn into dogs . " " i 've always wondered about that . dogs do n't usually stick around here long . " " it 's just a
[45/1000]	" what are we going to do with them ? " jim asked . " we ca n't just toss them around and kill them , " anna started to say . but then she was stopped .
[46/1000]	the guard glanced at the top of the stairs , then nodded and let him go . they continued up , and the first minute or so went by . finally it was time to stop for the night
[47/1000]	they walked across the beach a couple of stops more before she followed him back into town . nick led her around the side of a block to a pub . it was small and the only people around
[48/1000]	no need to dwell on the painful memories . let me focus on the matter at hand . " did the person tell him where we were taking you ? " that was the question . she shook her
[49/1000]	" it 's a good thing i do n't mind a few drops of blood . " chapter 19 once the doctor had made his observations on kylie 's wounds , he went back to his monitor and
[50/1000]	" what about food ? after that ? they did n't have enough in the cave , and they were starting to use up all their energy . that 'll just be a distraction . " " where ?
[51/1000]	" hello ? " a male voice called . " hello , " chad admitted , leaning against the stone bench that sheltered him . " this is chad . i 'm a friend of alex , and i
[52/1000]	" if i was n't so damn desperate for you , i 'd kill something , " jake said with irritation and frustration . " i 'll admit , " cale admitted . " i 'm happy you 'll
[53/1000]	a smile played at the corners of his mouth . the other woman shrugged . " i 'm just saying . it could be nice if we could stay . " " the hell you are . "
[54/1000]	" and as for a certain human being , " barris said , " i would argue ... yes , a very logical argument , but one which would be in my mind with great difficulty , in a hypothetical
[55/1000]	" you guys are out of it , " kelly said when she broke away from her friends . " i just started smoking , thanks to you . why are you guys here ? " mike smiled grimly
[56/1000]	this time he did look at her . " thanks , but i really do n't think i could put my hands . " " then join the party . " she wanted to deny it .
[57/1000]	" are you going to eat the cake now ? " her mother asked , holding out a tray . heather followed her mother into a lovely sitting room , and the two girls sat both on comfortable green
[58/1000]	" that was my first call , " i said . " and i ca n't ignore him . " " he 's got his reasons , " connor said . the thought of the police chief accusing connor
[59/1000]	" well ... " i said awkwardly , not sure of what to say to make it seem anything less than the truth . " i want to be . and that is what is important about my place in
[60/1000]	" so we understand each other . " if so , then the words came out too slowly . it must be my brain in overdrive because my mouth still worked . " you have a relationship with
[61/1000]	" i will , " he said , " but you come back . " " in a month , " i said , trying to think of a neutral name . he nodded once and turned away
[62/1000]	i shrugged . " maybe . " " let 's go , " ben said . we walked down as close a hallway as we could and then past two empty labs . ben stopped them and pulled
[63/1000]	was he still thinking about her ? the way his chest constricted , the way his heart had leapt and burned ? or was it her in his mind , a part of him that had fallen victim to the
[64/1000]	" if you do n't mind . it 's great i think . let 's go and eat at your place . " " i ca n't . i have a movie . i do n't want to waste
[65/1000]	it was a beautiful summer morning . the entire city was bustling with activity and commotion . horses were being pick eted and pick eted , carriages were arriving , and drivers were directing horses in every direction . horses
[66/1000]	" no , " her voice began to rise in volume . " i know you want to have sex while we have it . and the sex is n't going to happen a million times , but why do
[67/1000]	" that is true . " they were so close , closer than he 'd ever thought he still could be . * * * " i got a letter this morning . " anna 's voice
[68/1000]	" his blood does not do strange things to things . " she nodded , her brow furrowing in thought . " his eyes do n't change color when he is in the throes of passion , and when
[69/1000]	the doctor smiles at me and hands me a little glass bottle of medicine . " why are you wearing that ? " i ask . " just another precaution . i 'm going to give you something
[70/1000]	it was a great surprise to see him here , after all these years he 'd been gone so long . it was the first time i 'd seen him really happy . suddenly a thought struck me but
[71/1000]	she pulled open the door and entered his den . " i 'm very glad that you came . " the man she saw sitting on the sofa , with something tucked under his arm , looked up
[72/1000]	he stood and took two steps toward me , his handsome face all intent . his eyes were on my face , pleading . he paused just a few inches from making contact with me . " i appreciate you
[73/1000]	" and what about the others ? " they asked . max grabbed onto her side and pulled her toward him <EOS> and asked , " and , " and began . then she turned to listen to the
[74/1000]	" come on . let 's get you out of those bandages and get over to the river . we can wash them off in the river . " he patted her waist . she did as he said
[75/1000]	" the old man did n't tell you that ? " " god no . it 's so hard to believe , do n't you think ? " " i think i remember the old man telling me
[76/1000]	" i want to go home . if that ... " and she nodded toward the helicopter . the woman was n't talking anymore , not that he could hear before she started . she 'd stopped breathing , too
[77/1000]	her eyes widened . " what are you making me do ? " he grinned and tucked his fingers under her chin , lifting it up just enough to look at her . " i was n't done yet
[78/1000]	" you should n't have done that . " i stood to face him and braced myself for his parting shot . " no . " the word was laced with something deeper . " i should have
[79/1000]	the old woman did n't notice ; she was still watching me . " who are you ? " i yelled . no answer . " i told you she would n't find him , son .
[80/1000]	" i 'm sorry , do you think it 's possible i had a dream ? " i asked , sitting down on his chest . " i saw the stars . i watched the planets and the clouds and
[81/1000]	he gave me his back . " okay . " but his voice did n't settle down . " that 's fine . i 'll get whatever you need . i 'm just ... " my voice trailed off
[82/1000]	" thanks , i will , " i said quickly . " i guess i 'll see you later . " he looked at me once more , his eyes glittering like sapphires . " see you later .
[83/1000]	" hello . " i give one of the few times i 'm introduced . " i 'm dr. sta y ner . how can i help you ? " he asks , his voice giving me a brief
[84/1000]	" we need you . i think they came looking for you . " " they ? who ? " " the wolves . " " here ? " " they may have come to find
[85/1000]	" you 're pregnant in two weeks , and we do n't know exactly when your doctor will come in and fix you up , " he informed me . " would you like my advice ? " he asked
[86/1000]	" we can have a party at jack 's place after , " i suggested . " like at the party ? " " yeah , i know a few people . that should help . "
[87/1000]	" you really do n't like me , " he said with a smile . he was in command now , and he 'd learned to enjoy it . " i truly do . " he picked up
[88/1000]	" i 'm here . " " sorry . no one could find out about it . i should have told you sooner . " " but you did n't . " " too bad . "
[89/1000]	ethan got to his feet . " is he doing it ? " i nodded . " i think he believes this was in retaliation for losing his grandmother . " " i am sorry i did n't
[90/1000]	" i 'm sorry , kate . i did n't know . i just ... i thought maybe i 'd done something wrong . i thought we were friends . " i nod . " i know . i
[91/1000]	" i know that , " she hissed , rising up on her knees . " i 'm not some stupid kid who gets her hopes up and thinks ... " " do n't . " he held up
[92/1000]	they walked in silence for a few minutes , and zane said , " now i 'll see if ty is okay . " " he was just working . he 's a good guy , i 'm sure
[93/1000]	i nodded out of the corner of my eye . " thanks for the drink , " i said . " and thank you for putting up with my antics this weekend . " " i 've never
[94/1000]	" so he found her . " " and you . and now you two are bonded . " " um , yeah , i 'm her . " that did not sound good . " are
[95/1000]	in the end , the boy would die in agony in a cell as well . for a moment , she was there again , searching his tortured mind , seeking the root of his despair . but
[96/1000]	it was then i realized that both the vampire and the boy had been right . jason was going to be fine ; we 'd leave him just as soon as we got a lock on the other vampire .
[97/1000]	" this is yours ? " he nods and sits down with a grunt , looking up at me . he is clearly annoyed , but i ignore it . i reach over and take the plate .
[98/1000]	in the morning , i opened the door to find an array of clothing : khaki pants and a ribbed blue dress shirt with ruffled pink and pink polka dots . i wondered briefly what blake would think of
[99/1000]	chapter 4 : war against the immortals we did n't get far . the entire guard dropped back as one on the edge . " that is the last of the vampires ; the rest split up to
[100/1000]	" can you take that shot ? " he whispered , brushing a strand of hair away from my face as he knelt on the sofa . " how ? " " i 'm not making a move
[101/1000]	" i did , and it cost me money i do n't know how to use , but i 'll still carry it around here forever . can you make it look like the sword of damo cles ? i
[102/1000]	with what she had , or had he borrowed it from someone else ? " thanks , mr. madison , " she said , nodding , more than willing to give him any help he needed . "
[103/1000]	" do n't you even dare ! " he said , his eyes never leaving mine . " if you ever call me again i 'll strangle you . you 're no part of this . i wo n't let
[104/1000]	we followed her to the office , and it was easy to see why she was interested in the new woman . you had to be if you thought she was going to be of value . the woman
[105/1000]	" we 'll give it a try together , " he said . it was just the right thing to ask of his old friend . it was just the right thing to say of all the things that could
[106/1000]	" at least tell me you 're hungry , " the waitress said as she stood by his side . " i 've got a great kitchen . " " thank you . actually , i 'm a little
[107/1000]	" i heard nothing . there 's no air in this house , not even enough to breathe ? " " i saw him last night , " chris said . " he 's gone now . "
[108/1000]	" what do you mean you are not part of it ? " asked sister joseph , her eyes blinking slowly . " you just walked in . are you a human trying to find your soul partner ? you
[109/1000]	" so you still want to work with me ? " she asked . " i love you , baby . " his words meant the world to her . it was the first good sign of the
[110/1000]	all he knew right now was that he had to reach her before he pulled out of her . he needed to feel her again , needed to feel her fingers drifting over his own flesh again . turning
[111/1000]	" ' not everyone is as weak as you , sir , " she said to sir horace , who was n't interested in answering , " sir horace , " she said , and turned to me . "
[112/1000]	the world stopped abruptly . we just stood there , watching as the old man went back out into the snow . somewhere above us , the wind howled and snapped . i heard him say : " come
[113/1000]	" i 'll hold him to it . i will make sure he has everything . he needs the money . will you please leave sydney for me ? " " of course , i 'll drop you off
[114/1000]	i did n't let myself think too hard . maybe it got the doctor thinking i was weak and had no idea what else to do . the doctor was going to give me something to drink and i
[115/1000]	" no idea . " she turned to look in the mirror and checked the mirror again . " i 'm going in , " she said and walked across the hall . " have a good time .
[116/1000]	" no , " he said softly . " i 'm not . this is a huge thing . and if i never see you again , one way or another ... " he shook his head , as if
[117/1000]	" of course we 'll need some form of id , " said det . vega . " there 'd be a lot of paperwork . " " now i 'm just happy they got more than their share
[118/1000]	" oh , crap . " she heard a low growl . " who ? " " a stray kitten . " " you did n't see it . " the wolf growled again . it
[119/1000]	" is that it ? " he nodded . " so you know it ai n't all that big , right ? she do n't use 'em much though . i heard her talking about it to someone ,
[120/1000]	and then my father brought a group of his men in with him . as he explained to the assembled men , i heard the rumble in the distance - heavy , deep , black , a growl . and
[121/1000]	he continued up the steps , and stopped when he opened the door to the library . the light was dim in the main room , and the curtains were drawn , but i could n't see anything from the
[122/1000]	" i did n't plan to , " he protested . " yes , you did . " he glanced down at her , brows raised . " was i that obvious ? " she snorted .
[123/1000]	" you mean , with the right amount of pressure . " " yeah . " " why in your presence ? " " because i feel ... " " what ? " " so
[124/1000]	he had left the lamp on in the office but he had not turned it on . he was wearing his underwear . i stared at his body , my mind not processing what this was but i
[125/1000]	" are you kidding me ? " " i 'm here to take you to work , not eat pizza , " she said and squeezed his knee again . " it 's hardly a pizza and what
[126/1000]	my father cleared his throat . " it will do you good to get dressed . " i shot him a look . " why do i have a feeling i 'm going to be dressed in another
[127/1000]	" he came into the building , but i had to lock up fast to keep him out , " i told her . " how long has it been ? " she asked . i could imagine in
[128/1000]	" do n't tempt me that way . i am not in love with connor . " " connor ? " " he is the hottest man i 've ever met . " selena 's ears perked
[129/1000]	" no way . " " i know , " she said softly . " they did n't think it was very funny . " " i 'm going to find someone . " " why
[130/1000]	there was no reason for her to think either . i 'd never been inside her before in my life . every instinct in me was screaming for me to get out , to drive away , but my
[131/1000]	" good - bye , james , i ca n't wait for you to meet my beautiful daughter " , he began , and then he vanished . " just like an angel " , i said in admiration
[132/1000]	" wow , i love you , " he whispered into her neck . " thank you for showing me where to stash <EOS> even over a lot . i do n't have to do anything . your skin was
[133/1000]	" i 'm sorry i ever met either of you . " " we do n't need to talk about it . " " maybe the person who lost you just did n't want to admit that she
[134/1000]	" is that what you did ? " he said . i raised my brows questioningly . " you have n't seen what i 've done . " " i saw a lot of shit , "
[135/1000]	" i 'm tired , " i said . " and i 'm sure i 'll be able to sleep . " i 'd had a terrible night . i 'd done my best to make it all go
[136/1000]	' only a few minutes . ' she pulled the cloth over her face , and squinted at the harsh sunlight coming through the window . ' you look tired , ' he remarked . ' yeah .
[137/1000]	" hello , ladies , " said amy as she put her hand on the table . " my name is amy b ingham and i am on a list of a missing persons person 's report . "
[138/1000]	" go back to sleep and play with your sword for a little bit . you have n't had any sleep in the last hour . " " will i be able to concentrate when i 'm here with
[139/1000]	i 'd been really interested in those tickets until i 'd seen the pictures and i 'd decided i loved them . " is that ... ? " the clerk murmured . " yeah . they were for
[140/1000]	" i was thinking , it 's probably best if i continue with the same operation as before . " i leaned forward , my eyes serious . " what do you mean ? " " when we
[141/1000]	" oh , i 'm sorry , sir , we were ... um , we were just ... out doing a tour . " her voice wobbled . he could actually see the tears forming in her eyes .
[142/1000]	" i have enough information to report on my location , my movements , my whereabouts , and i need that information to be available to you . there are also important things i have to talk to you about
[143/1000]	" i 'll find the right one , " i say , and turn off my light . " goodbye , max . " i turn the power off and shut the door behind me . a quick glance
[144/1000]	i was having a feeling i had n't given away any of the things i wanted that very moment , or at least the important ones i had the desire to share . could i just go for it ?
[145/1000]	' i was n't planning on doing that . ' he leans back against the wall , still looking at her . ' that part had been in his head . what happened to me so long ago could n't
[146/1000]	" when ? " his fingers shook as he pushed the file away . " i never saw the file - " " because it was confidential . " she 'd never seen the file . " it was
[147/1000]	" all right ! " " i 'll talk the conversation , and i 'll get myself home safely . if i do n't , you can stay and wait for mr. meyer , all right ? "
[148/1000]	the woman was a few years older , twenty - five maybe , and very pretty . the lady introduced herself to the man . " carol , this is mr. mason 's daughter , carol , " she
[149/1000]	he smiled at her just enough to tell her so . " you 're one fine woman . very beautiful , you know . " she flushed and her gaze darted to the front , where the other car
[150/1000]	" so you know about his death . " she held out a slender hand . he reached her , took her fingers in his . he could feel the strength of her touch . " i know everything
[151/1000]	" you 'll have to come with me , " he quickly retorts . " i already did . " my foot rubs against the rough grain now , and i lean against it . " it
[152/1000]	" i 'm in a mood today , " he said , moving toward her . " the man to whom i owe everything . " " i can imagine . why are you late ? " "
[153/1000]	i knew exactly what she meant . it was really nothing . " i 'm sorry , " i said . to my surprise , i was the one who made the apology . " do n't be
[154/1000]	" i 'll take it , " she says , " but you have to know it is n't necessary . " there is an uncomfortable pause as we wait for her to continue . " you ca
[155/1000]	" i do n't want them to pay . " " they have no way to pay you , " i admitted , almost choking on the words myself . " i 'm working on it . "
[156/1000]	" the last time i checked , i was n't a child . " i laughed <EOS> to worry me . in my bed . i 'd never had a lot , even ... " are you going to
[157/1000]	he walked towards her and knelt down . he could feel the tears forming in her eyes , but her bravado was gone , lost in the excitement she wanted to feel overcoming her . " if you 're
[158/1000]	" if you have a boyfriend , talk to him and see if he 's interested . i think his name is mike . " it took a few minutes to get there , all two hundred fifty people
[159/1000]	" well , yes , i 'm afraid you do . it was my fault . i should n't have done it . all i knew as i went through school was that they were crazy fanatics and that i
[160/1000]	" or maybe not . " " maybe not , " i echoed . " the best thing you can do , i think , is go home . " i nodded . " i 'll
[161/1000]	" so who are we ? what does he want ? " he whispered . " i do n't know . but if we hurry , we might be able to get to it in time . "
[162/1000]	" i could give you a million bucks , but why ? what did you buy this for ? how old are you ? " " i 'm no good for the money . it 's just sex .
[163/1000]	" why do n't you go see it , then , " the witch suggested . " let 's see if it 's real . you still have the knife . " i stared at her , aghast .
[164/1000]	i ignored him . " yes , i guess you are . but i never agreed to that and we have n't talked about selling . " there was a pause , broken off by james 's muffled laugh .
[165/1000]	" just stay with me , okay ? " i say over <EOS> ... . " i 've never seen anything better he 's gone . this is my dream . " " i thought it was my birthday
[166/1000]	" i have been waiting for you , mother , " i said as he pulled me into a hug . " you 're right . i do love you , son . i was worried when you did
[167/1000]	he grabbed me under my arms and lifted me to our feet in one swift movement , pushing my skirt up with a twist in the bottom of his hand . he stepped toward the house , i followed
[168/1000]	" for me , love , it 's only fair . " " no . " " no , what ? " " no . " she pushed at his chest . " i wo n't do
[169/1000]	" and did it work ? " " i told you anything was possible . " his brow creased , and a sudden fire flared in his eyes . " how can you say that ? you were
[170/1000]	' for the time being , yes we shall . ' ' good , then can we possibly meet again tomorrow night ? ' ' i wonder if that would make too much of a problem ? '
[171/1000]	i was n't sure where a hundred percent of this went . it was n't like i made a lot of sense anyway i just asked . i had a fairly clear idea of whether dad was working a late
[172/1000]	" you 're right . to me at least . what 's the deal ? " " we need to figure out where she lives . " " you 've got a plan . " " yeah
[173/1000]	" oh , " he said , taking off his glasses and clearing his throat . i turned as he said this and saw that even though he looked different - more refined and refined - his eyes were still
[174/1000]	" i 'm not sure . it still does n't explain why you 're here - or why you 're so different . " " you seem to think i 'm different . " he shook his head ,

[176/1000]	" do n't even think it ! " the admiral 's voice boomed . " you do all of us a disser vice ! and we already have one casualty who 's already dead , so you 're all delu
[177/1000]	he turns me around so i fall to the ground . he has no right to treat me like this . i am injured and not the first girl he 's ever hit . i should be more upset about
[178/1000]	" right here ? " " back in the car . i picked the lock . " " oh god , " i said again . i opened the door and held out a hand where i thought
[179/1000]	" his memory is still blurry . " i heard a car 's engine and a moment later the passenger door opened . " sorry i 'm late , " jamie said . " i went to check on
[180/1000]	" then it is my guess that the women the children go out with only were brought here because the soldiers with them were ordered to do so . " " or maybe that was n't her idea .
[181/1000]	and there he was , at the far end of the great oak - house where the old house was settled , his legs spread , a bundle of clothes wrapped in a thick blanket . " she was
[182/1000]	" that was really sweet of you , you know . you even came by to say you 're putting out a birthday gift . " i laughed , looking over the last few weeks . i 'd done some
[183/1000]	" sorry , it 's for the children 's sake . " " she does n't seem like the kind of person to be ashamed . " " is <EOS> ' our dad , and making things ?
[184/1000]	i turn around to face him . " i never even kissed you back , did i ? why ? " he lowers the fork he 's holding . " i told you it 's complicated . what 's
[185/1000]	" hey " - i nodded - " are you ready ? " " i do n't know " - she crossed her arms across her chest - " i wish i was n't . these guys are not
[186/1000]	and while the wind did no harm , the air did . he felt every jolt and sigh . each time he felt the wind . just like a balloon , a full half - full balloon . the sudden
[187/1000]	" of course , " we all said . everyone looked at the clock on the wall above our heads . " we 'd better get started , " emma said . she did n't open her book again
[188/1000]	for the benefit of all i could hope for , as well , the woman had no hesitation in shooting me with a dart , which she pulled from her purse . my head jerked up , and i stared
[189/1000]	" i ca n't help it , " i said . " what else are we going to do ? " i looked down the street to where the mall was . the first thing i saw was
[190/1000]	" we would just have to make sure to point out that you have no power on this end . " he did n't look away from her although i saw some of his expression turn deadly as he
[191/1000]	" okay . " i went outside . even though it was just about two in the afternoon , a full moon was going on . i wondered how often they took the time to call the town , but
[192/1000]	it 's all he has to say . i do n't speak as we step off campus and down the cobblestone street . i ca n't trust the way he 's acting . " well , tell me , "
[193/1000]	she continued to tell me about herself and her mother , and i listened , keeping my eyes on hannah out the corner of my eye . i could n't tell if she was excited or terrified . either way
[194/1000]	and why not ? to be safe , the human human species , all of them , from this , this pestil ence in this , this plague ? the man paused , staring down at the paper ,
[195/1000]	chapter 50 on our first evening in london , we turned up to the estate , where the man from the hospital was a professor of some sort . he was going to a function at an institute that
[196/1000]	and we all know where this had led : to where he had been when my mom died . even if we did n't , his reasons and intentions were still good ones . and at that moment in time
[197/1000]	" are you sure ? " one of the women said . " i know him , " hanna marin said . a collective gasp went around the table as hanna turned on her sidekick and began logging
[198/1000]	i felt a hot flush rise on my face as images of jake sliding his hands further down my thighs came flooding back into my mind . i shivered , wishing i could stay behind and continue watching him play
[199/1000]	but the worst is yet to come . because then i will never be able to get to gage again . i take the small book out of my pocket and flip to the first page , where people have
[200/1000]	" then i could always use the help . i did n't realize i was going to be looking for a lover and was just wondering what to do when i saw you - and wanted to talk to you
[201/1000]	at the corner , i turned . her gaze was on the book . i saw it sitting on the counter , near her wrist . i went over and picked the book up . i opened it
[202/1000]	the words came out right before mine . " why ? " i asked . " why did you bring me here ? i was told the vampire council has all the information i needed , but you said you
[203/1000]	it was an embarrassing way to begin the day . i was looking forward to getting through the day without having to spend the afternoon with him or watching movies with him or sitting by the fire with him in
[204/1000]	" they would be more grateful if i did not ruin them , " he said and ran a hand through his hair . " i 've been planning our wedding for years . the other women make certain we
[205/1000]	it might be a while before the house was completed , but i was excited . i took another page of directions from the notebook . the next stop was at my parents ' private high school , '
[206/1000]	" i guess not , " i mumbled . " but the thing is , " he continued , " this is different . " " what 's different ? " " you 're going to be
[207/1000]	" can i see you ? " she calls out . " yes you can , " ryan replies . " come on up here , " she says . " just so you know , it 's
[208/1000]	" i came here to tell you that i want you to be my wife . i want us to spend our lives making love . is that too much to ask ? i want that with you , even
[209/1000]	" you going fishing this week , " he asks , pausing just shy of the surface of a wave . i nod . " good , " he says when the boat 's current lets us forward
[210/1000]	he pulled himself up . his face was streaked with tears , and his gaze was weary but filled with anger . his hair was unkempt and shaggy and he wore a sleeveless black t - shirt , dark jeans
[211/1000]	" how could i go back there ? they would let you take me in for what i did to them , " she sobbed . " they would tear me apart . i do n't know how to explain
[212/1000]	" i 'm on my way . " i did n't even wait for his response . i 'd just turned the corner of the house into his driveway and was about to park when my world came to
[213/1000]	" there 's my boy , " his hostess greeted him . " happy to meet you , mrs. hol liday , " mike muttered and as the lady gave him another smile , he went on , "
[214/1000]	" this is serious , gabriel , " she announced . he turned and glared at her . " seriously that 's what i think . " " that it 's going to happen again ? "
[215/1000]	" i do n't know . i thought ... this makes no sense . his father did n't like to talk about his past , and my father did n't like his son hanging around him . he 's kept
[216/1000]	" if i 'd known this story , i would n't have called you . " " it would have been nice . " " maybe when you guys had an official breakup , i would have had
[217/1000]	a low roar came from deep inside her , and she knew he was nearing his release . she could n't help herself . she went to her knees before him and began stroking his c * ck from root
[218/1000]	" i do not know . " " you are afraid of your reflection , no doubt , " i answer simply . " that is how you are . you hide more than you wish , but it
[219/1000]	<EOS> . a huge , boisterous man who was an expert on physical warfare : an expert , in fact , that had earned him his nickname of an out sized bra wler . i told myself i did n't
[220/1000]	" we went to england to meet the prince 's grandson who , " she said , " was not here . so we left him there . then we got to england . " an uneasy silence suddenly
[221/1000]	" i 'll arrange that , " he said . " thank you , " she said . she felt herself getting warmer , but there was something better about the warmth . more like a pleasant heat than
[222/1000]	" i should be glad to meet you , " she said , rising . " i 'm an engineer . " " yes , sir . but i assure you , i 've never met by accident .
[223/1000]	they turned to him , eyebrows raised ; he held on to the wall behind him with one hand as he leaned on it with the other . he looked at each of the men , a muscle twitching in
[224/1000]	i smiled . now the reality was that i had just let me down . i 'd wanted to talk to her . i wanted to touch her . now it was over . before i 'd even had time
[225/1000]	" yes , " she answered . " he 's a terrible example . after that night , he told me he 'd never stop seeking me . " at the time , her words had n't exactly pleased
[226/1000]	" do n't argue with me . " the words seemed out of place in the silence , and on the outside it was n't so much a threat but more of a promise . a long , slow
[227/1000]	i felt it within my flesh , in my bones , within my very bones , <EOS> the first time . from the car in the past with my parents , as it ran through the house over the years
[228/1000]	the captain said , " what is he supposed to do with us ? " what sort of question is that ? i 'm just going to ride with a few men to port . " james replied ,
[229/1000]	" okay " - she said , trying to smile - " me too . " he nodded . " you are most welcome to stay . " i had no idea where i was or what was
[230/1000]	" i 'm going to tell you this once . if you keep your mouths shut , it 'll be the last time you call me that . you understand ? " " yes . yes , i understand
[231/1000]	" are you done talking about your feelings ? " " no ! " his hands are on my face , rubbing my forehead . " let 's get on with it . " he does n't understand
[232/1000]	the four of them sat around the living room . mrs. truman , thomas , robert , and her were sitting in various places wearing jeans , tee shirts , and winter jackets . the dogs followed mrs. truman and
[233/1000]	all good things in life are not meant to be accomplished through deception . they are meant to be followed by lies ; lies that are not intended to be proved . what i am not ready to believe
[234/1000]	the voice inside luce 's mind was soft , almost ... hesitant . " of course it is , " the voice said . " you 're feeling overwhelmed by the whole concept of , now , of the portal
[235/1000]	" i do know - i have someone i wanted to get to know a little better . " i nodded . " i was wondering if ... " he put his fork down . " i mean if
[236/1000]	i felt a few prickles of awareness pass before david 's voice again . " well , did you know he 's a vampire ? " he said . " sure did n't , " i lied .
[237/1000]	" he 's not so much older than me but we 're both a little younger than most of most of our kids his age . " " no matter what he tells you she 's his mother .
[238/1000]	" no ! why are you guys thinking that ? " " because that 's their problem the old man just gave them a case for the flu and they 're really screwed up because of it . "
[239/1000]	this was where i found him ... or rather i tried to find him . he was lying in bed at home , my heart in my throat . he was lying immobile with his arms up above his head
[240/1000]	" i can smell it , " said tommy . " she 's been calling them like she 's talking to them , like there 's a person in the house with her . " " you see a
[241/1000]	the rest of the day 's afternoon passed in a blur of activity . we packed it all in tight . we were going on time . and he wanted to do it anyway . it just depended on
[242/1000]	she does n't like me very much . maybe even more than that . she 's always been pissed . i try to hide it so well . when she finds that i 'm keeping my distance from her ,
[243/1000]	but her mother saw them up close . " good morn , rose marie . it is good to see you again . i hear you are mending . " rose could n't speak . her throat was too
[244/1000]	" how often do you write to write ? " " about three or four a year . most of the time . " " how old are you ? " " twenty - two . "
[245/1000]	" why the hell would i kill someone ? " the man exclaimed , his voice turning violent as he paced to the windows . " why does everyone fear what i am ? and is n't there any time
[246/1000]	" are you ready ? " " sure . " " we will head out at six . " she looked at him . " you know i respect your privacy . i want to know it 's
[247/1000]	" i 'd like to see him . " " you want to see him when you graduate ? " " yes . " an hour later dr. bloom had changed his patient 's bandages and the
[248/1000]	" very well , " he said , " we meet again . " twenty - seven october 29 , 19 43 it 's done . i wish i had n't felt so damned guilty .
[249/1000]	" maybe . maybe . " she did n't look at me . when i could n't say anything else , she said , " thanks for the beer . " " no problem , " i said .
[250/1000]	" a - and tell me how ... uh ... " on top of being too busy to make a proper sound ( or when he opened his eyes ) to speak , " how the hell ... how
[251/1000]	i went back inside the room , then went immediately to the bathroom to change my clothes . i was on the verge of tears . but i told myself to pull it together . it was just a meeting
[252/1000]	" your honor , i ca n't think of anywhere you can have gone wrong ! " said joseph . i remember the jury was skeptical to judge lawrence , but joseph read his plea as " guilty " .
[253/1000]	" do you hate him ? " she asked . " no . " " you knew that she left him . " " he was a problem , " dylan said . " he was just
[254/1000]	" i wish you 'd let your mother go , " ethan says . " we missed her . she had the flu . the whole thing was so sudden . she seemed fine - really happy - but she
[255/1000]	" not too long , " the girl said . " just a couple more minutes . i 'm julie . " a couple seconds . in the corner of her vision , she saw her father come to
[256/1000]	" my parents are catholic . there 's a lot of bad blood between them . i do n't know if i 'm ready to be a priest . " " if you 're so afraid of being a
[257/1000]	" sure . we had them for a while . " so what does that mean ? " there 's more here than you can possibly imagine . " " there has to be more than you think
[258/1000]	" i bet you 'd let yourself be blown to kingdom come ! " " the lord of light would n't put everyone out , " he replied pointedly . " the lord of light never treats others
[259/1000]	then he looks up at the high walls and finally , out the half - broken windshield , past a horde of hungry , yellow eyes . they are huge , like a beast , but i can see the
[260/1000]	i did n't know what i expected . my father . maybe my mother . and maybe someone else . but after that ? i did n't know . i assumed it was worse . worse in worse than the
[261/1000]	the people of the camp were all still gathered in the camp . they were talking , but not very loudly . " they do this all the time , " said the girl . " they make every

[263/1000]	" just enough , " kelly said . " he was getting close to turning the wheel hard . " " yes , but if - " " then his foot hit the brake , on the other
[264/1000]	" what did you do ? " his face was twisted with confusion . " put my hand behind him . i thought if i did it , i 'd feel better . " " but - "
[265/1000]	" what do you mean ... make of it ? how ? " " the demon ! " there was a loud squeal followed by an explosive crunch and a loud explosion . " it took me
[266/1000]	" then perhaps we have had our fill for one night , " he suggested . " but i 'm so tired , " charlotte said , laying her hand on his . " you 're exhausted , too
[267/1000]	" what 's that ? " he asked with his eyebrows raised . " nothing , " she said , reaching for his arm even though he refused to respond . " i have to get back ,
[268/1000]	" my son is a true guardian of heaven , " lord odin said calmly . " he shall act as the guardian to watch over every soul . when he is ready , i am sure you will enjoy
[269/1000]	" yes , of course . " " just an idea . some of the children have other interests of some interest . i 'm sure they 're enjoying the city . " " and do you think
[270/1000]	" and what ? what is our plan for keeping her out of the way of my little sisters ? " " you ca n't do that , dad . " ethan 's tone was firm . "
[271/1000]	' that 's a nice way to put it , ' she says , nodding as she walks beside me . ' it 's a lot of fun to ride around them . ' she means riding on my
[272/1000]	a quick glance showed her that the other three men were gone with him , as well . she was surrounded by several of the local vampires , some of whom she recognized . " why did n't you
[273/1000]	the second step was the opening of the kitchen cabinets . the door on the right had been opened and it revealed the contents - a half - full bowl of chips , two half - eaten sandwiches , a
[274/1000]	" the name 's cole . " i shook my head . " i ca n't go there ... " " the name 's michael 's , and that 's what suits you . you do n't look
[275/1000]	i was all in . i was n't about to give up just because her career had been jeopardi zed . i was about to change . 3 . " how did you know ? " i
[276/1000]	" i 'll never see one and i 'm sure they wo n't let me - " " shhh , hush . " mark rubbed my lower back in a gentle motion . " we are only stopping here
[277/1000]	" i 'm sure it is , " he said . " the last time i came to see you was about a year ago . " he paused , as if gathering his thoughts . " you wanted to
[278/1000]	" i know you 're here , " i reminded him . " you know i 'm here . " " we find a way to escape . " " with the element of surprise . " i
[279/1000]	" no , just got here an hour ago . i think perhaps we should keep the case open for now , it might be easier to get everyone to talk . however , i think it would be better
[280/1000]	" oh , how bad is this ? " i looked at my bare legs , still slightly damp from the shower with damien . " not bad at all . " he bent slowly , his lips kissing
[281/1000]	" i can tell , " she said . " <EOS> - and then we have n't had any other night what do you want me to do .... " there was nothing like it , but something
[282/1000]	" you 're on , " he said before reaching out to shake her hand , pulling away like she 'd offended him . " you are in a very lucky guy , the way you 're acting .
[283/1000]	the vampire had changed so much . i began to regret that i had n't done more to save his life . the vampire turned , seeing me behind the massive body of the child , screaming i
[284/1000]	" oh , i know ! it 's just a question of whether it will be good enough or not . i guess i just have to guess the number . " " maybe we can come up with
[285/1000]	" we were only friends , " he blurted . " she 's right in front of me . " she pulled away from him . " now i want to kiss her . but i 'm an adult
[286/1000]	" nothing , " i lied , my emotions feeling a little like they were being ripped away from me . suddenly , cole 's hand slipped beneath my shirt and stroked my stomach . i felt a new
[287/1000]	" you are n't supposed to get so angry , dr. warthrop ! and now i 'll have to go tell the boss . i 'll probably do him an even worse favor with a telegram , the very last
[288/1000]	i 'm not sure why everyone just wanted to hear and accept my story , but it 's natural to them . " i had never loved a human when i was a guardian before my turn . " i
[289/1000]	" we will do our best , " said ma di . she was obviously annoyed , but not at ma di . " well i hope some of us have seen worse , because if not more than
[290/1000]	something flashed up from under the bed , not a spark , but a flare of light . i ducked my head and pulled a pair of headphones over my ears , covering my mouth . at the sound
[291/1000]	i think of it , the idea that my friend and mother really did have the same dark feelings for him that we do . but i 'm not prepared for it because i 've just told him how scared
[292/1000]	" so you 're the one who 's here now . " adam picked one of my hands up and kissed my knuckles . i did n't know if he was flirting with me , but i kept my mouth
[293/1000]	" go away , " i shouted . i grabbed her by the shoulders , pulled her against me . " go do what you started . it 's over . " i pulled her up by the elbows ,
[294/1000]	' have not you been asking about the man named pe tru se from the shop ? he may be able to take you to his brother at school or to the police station . ' ' really ?
[295/1000]	" we 've already paid for our food . " it was a little over six - months since the arrival of the first baby , and she had n't noticed anything out of the ordinary . " i
[296/1000]	" we were trying to warn you . " " what about him ? " she cut in , motioning at the car with her chin . " is it his fault you thought he did n't want to
[297/1000]	" i will be leaving now and i 'm tired of this game you play . " " now , do n't be hasty , " he said . " we are all playing this game whether you like
[298/1000]	" that 's fine , " i said , hoping she would hurry the hell up . " i do n't want us to be interrupted . " " you 're sure ? " she asked , looking between
[299/1000]	" i 'll be fine , " i told her , but she did n't hear me . i glanced over my shoulder several times , looking for an exit . surely , we had enough exits for the entire
[300/1000]	" that could very well be true , " said the stranger and bowed his head low . his eyes were all black depths of the night and seemed to pierce into her soul and it shocked her mind that
[301/1000]	" for twenty - four years , and , to that end , i 've lived with them . " " in a way , this makes everything all right . " " i would n't say that
[302/1000]	but she could n't go with you ? that was n't possible , especially after everything they 'd already been through the past few days -- even having to endure that . she did n't know enough about their relationship
[303/1000]	she had let him kiss her in the hallway too , she reminded herself . he was probably a terrible kisser . unfortunately the thought of his lips on hers after the night that had just transpired left her
[304/1000]	" what 's wrong ? what do n't you like about this place ? why are n't you afraid to come here ? " the man asked . " fear is the wrong word . you see , the
[305/1000]	" well , that was a joke , " i laughed . " yes , but if he had stayed out here all night , he would n't have been able to see the place . " "
[306/1000]	she nodded . " it 's his fault . he called me a whore . " " is that his first name ? " " i 've always called myself that . " she was getting a bit
[307/1000]	once again , he had the sensation of running in circles . back and forth with the ceiling . over and over again without meaning to . he really did n't know what he was experiencing , but he was
[308/1000]	' a part of it , ' said jack , his eyes on the boy . ' at any rate , ' continued gardener , ' my father is the best man in all the world . he is
[309/1000]	she looks across the dining room to the front of the house . i hold my breath , fearing she 'll see me . she looks back at the porch . " the place looks just as good as
[310/1000]	" you realize what it could mean , " he said , and i shut up . " the next five minutes would be a good reason to hold the gun , " i said . " ah
[311/1000]	" you would have been able to come along then , we have lost a lot of people here . then there was the plague . we needed some kind of closure to deal with it . that whole thing
[312/1000]	what the fuck had happened ? was there something i could have done to help her ? i never knew how we got out of there . we arrived at the police station where we were finger printed and
[313/1000]	when the doorbell rang , she hurried to answer it . " are you ready ? " asked nate , entering the living room . " i 'm just coming , " said reenie and found her daughter
[314/1000]	there was something about her face that would n't quite fit , a little shimmer that was n't quite right . it was hard to pinpoint exactly what she was doing , but her face seemed familiar to him for
[315/1000]	well , that was the problem . she did n't want to say those things . she did n't want to tell him that she did n't want to live without him , even when they were standing here at
[316/1000]	" you have <EOS> because i want to let him know you are too much . " the young man standing like a demon for a long time . that 's the only truth that he knows . it
[317/1000]	my heart was racing and i struggled to put what i wanted into words . " i do n't ... " i started , but choked on the words . " i do n't know . " she glanced
[318/1000]	" right , " charlie said . " he took the little guy under the arm , took him back to his room , and locked the door . i do n't know if we should run after them .
[319/1000]	" you think she gets the better of me , then ? " sam asked . " do you ? " i turned my attention back to the ceiling , thinking about my mother and how little i trusted
[320/1000]	" in the end i have no clue as to what to do . all i know is i have more than enough money . " he had to hide his feelings . " i 've got to get away
[321/1000]	in her apartment a man sat alone at the small table . he had on a dark blue t - shirt and baggy jeans . his face was hidden under his hair as he concentrated on drawing in his drawing
[322/1000]	" is this about that mysterious creature ? " said the boy . " well no it 's not about the creature , " said coraline . " but it sure does seem a bit odd . when you
[323/1000]	two " ready . " i turned to look at tate . she was standing at the office door holding her bag in one hand , a white cloth tucked into the side of it . her expression
[324/1000]	" the way you 're looking at me , i get the feeling you 'd rather be with a girl ? " " i like to think that other people can see how i look at you . i
[325/1000]	" we 're here to stay , " the man explained gruffly . sam turned back to him . " was there anything else you needed ? " " do you mean anything other than to tell me
[326/1000]	" for now ? " i ask , more a question than anything else . " then we need to work on getting to her , " he answers , setting his drink down on the glass coffee table
[327/1000]	ryan gave him a lopsided grin . " right , " i said . " so ... you okay with moving back in with the old guy ? " " i guess . " i could always
[328/1000]	that 's right . so is the title , the painting , anything connected to it . is it even real ? " okay , " julie said with a nod , " i 'll do that . show
[329/1000]	there was another sound : <EOS> 1 - bang ! 2 ( knock , knock ) 3 ( knock ) 4 ( knock ) 5 ( knock ) 6 ( knock ) 7
[330/1000]	" i 'm afraid i would . " " good . i do n't want to go to bed tomorrow , and i do n't want to visit the school today . " " what ? "
[331/1000]	" fine , you two , " alex said . " we appreciate your help , but this is simply beyond our help . " the men 's faces did not change . " it has something to do with
[332/1000]	i sigh , turning around as i cross the room . i will have to change into something more comfortable to get in there . as i make my way over to the bed , i notice two shirts
[333/1000]	" we 're moving to tucson for the summer for the summer . they 're saying a lot about you . " " i 'm here for the summer to work - to study , " luis said ,
[334/1000]	" we found a set of keys on her bag and we were going to get her some clothes and we are going to send her off with us so we can take her to the park after we get
[335/1000]	" you 're going to go ? " " yes . " he glanced away , clearly not wanting me to look at something that was never <EOS> really there . " are you sure ? "
[336/1000]	" you think i ca n't say ? " " ah , god , i wish i was going to put you outside in the rain . " he shook his head and turned away , rubbing his temples
[337/1000]	it rang again , loud and resounding , the sound of the buzzer . max answered it with a question in his tone , " yes ? " he listened , the smile fading from his face , and
[338/1000]	" yes , my love . " i nodded my head slowly , my eyes brimming with memories and love . " but how ? how does anyone heal through death ? " " the death of a
[339/1000]	" no . " i pull away from his hold and feel the blood drain from my face . " no , " i choke out again as i turn to run . " not - the - "
[340/1000]	he stopped , but not from her . he drew back instead and looked down at her . " i 'll think of you all the time , and i 'll dream of you . but if you want me
[341/1000]	he laughed and he looked at the camera as if it was a piece of furniture that had caught his complete attention . " you 're a lot nicer than i ever suspected you were . " he looked at
[342/1000]	" i 'm all right . i mean , you just got here , well ... i did n't know you were coming , " he said . i almost did n't think it was possible to feel more comfortable
[343/1000]	" do you mind me asking what they do to the prisoners ? " i said . warden shook his head and turned his back to me . he moved to the chair against the wall . " every
[344/1000]	i was surprised at what he said , not at all surprised . one would think he was the kind to talk to his friends about personal relationships . like i said , he was a grown man . i
[345/1000]	" please , " she heard the last one hissed . then he left her again , and her left was empty . " you should n't have left her here , " she heard portia say to stella .
[346/1000]	' okay , ' i answered , making him smile slowly . okay , i was scared . ' i think you 'll be all right ' he said softly as if saying it would mean more to me
[347/1000]	please , gods , let him know i 'm okay , i beg you . please help me . my mouth still moving , i asked over and over , " please help me . " still ,
[348/1000]	david 's eyes grew wide and he stood up . " i do n't think i could do that , " he spoke quietly to himself . he turned to me for help . " i 'm sorry , ara
[349/1000]	" and ? " " i think you can get me into her pants . " " you mean with her legs around my waist ? " " hell , yes , " she says , flashing
[350/1000]	" where is that ? " " on his way to make a call to the detective captain . " the captain 's voice sounded tired . " he 'll be picking us up in ten minutes or so
[351/1000]	" ah , " said the man . " that 's good . a simple sentence to leave our minds un confused . perhaps we should n't think about the last few sentences on his transcript . " he
[352/1000]	" it 's the only safe place i can find , " gabriel promised , his blue eyes glittering . " there are some things you do n't need to know , gabriel , " i sighed .
[353/1000]	" i have great plans for you . " " i 'd rather hear them from you before you go . " " oh , come on , no . as long as i have you , i
[354/1000]	he heard her speak . " no ! i wo n't ... i'll see you first , then i 'll tell you everything . " he was surprised her voice was steady . he heard her running the water
[355/1000]	" i like to , you know , make an impression . " she wanted to smile . " good . tell me all about yourself . tell me about new york and the buildings there . "
[356/1000]	this was the moment she waited for . at him saying " go home " just before he gave in to her demand to speak . how she longed to go home to her husband and their family ,
[357/1000]	" is that so ? " his shoulders rose and fell a bit . " then take us back to the original plan , sweetheart . " " i - what ? " he glanced like he was
[358/1000]	nick nodded . " she wo n't let me drink anything . i ca n't let her think i had something to do with her dad 's death . " " nick , think of your mom . "
[359/1000]	" this just ... " i shook my head , not knowing what to say . " i ca n't deal with this now . " he wiped his hand across his head , sending the front of his
[360/1000]	a few minutes later , i come down the stairs and i 'm in the elevator leaving in order to go home in style . it 's quite the feat because as soon as i go through the glass doors
[361/1000]	while her eyes were now wide with curiosity , i could see the girl in her - i could see her reflected in her cheeks and nose , and in the green flecks in her eyes - more of her
[362/1000]	" that 's why he 's been so distant and distant lately , i was finally convinced he was taking the divorce hard . " " can you explain ? " " what i ca n't understand is
[363/1000]	i looked once again at the screen and frowned . " all right , okay . i 'll do it . are you sure you do n't want to go ahead and do it with me ? " he
[364/1000]	the man looked up and grinned . " hello , mrs. carter , " he said as he approached . his eyes widened when he noticed the rifle . " why are you still here ? " she answered
[365/1000]	" of course . i will give you the rest of the day off . i have a lot on my mind . you have to be hungry so we can keep working on your homework . then we can
[366/1000]	" what 's going on ? " kylie asked . " i 'm just having a little trouble . " burnett stood and rounded the corner , but when kylie looked up , his eyes looked different ,
[367/1000]	" i 've only been in your home for fifteen minutes . " " fifteen . " " give me twenty , that 's all . " we were interrupted by miss lottie 's voice .
[368/1000]	mr. marlin 's eyes appeared in the window . " well , now , that 's certainly not something to worry about to me , " he said . " but you can forget about worrying for a moment .
[369/1000]	" the only reason you 're asking is because you wanna know if i 'm working with her . " " how long is she staying here ? " " not sure , but i 'll find out
[370/1000]	we did n't make much progress on the second set , but we did get a lot of other people to help , and the rest of the group agreed to help . " this is your chance ,
[371/1000]	" we 're going to find her . " " where are she ? " he asked . i looked around the room , back and forth , back and forth , until finally i smiled .
[372/1000]	" all he asked for was space - is n't that crazy ? " she shook her head . " no , but that did n't mean he was n't happy . " " glad i 'm here
[373/1000]	if they got married , it would be with a child . after the ceremony , she 'd go with him . she 'd get a job working in an office somewhere . she 'd have the chance to meet
[374/1000]	" i 'll be in the kitchen , " she called back . " will you go to the park ? " i asked . " nope , " she answered . i went back to thinking
[375/1000]	" she 's pretty . if you like her , she 's pretty . " i chuckled under my breath . " you 're such a liar , trent . she 's not nearly as pretty as you .
[376/1000]	" yes , of course , " elizabeth said . i walked up beside her and they stopped in front of a large green glass revolving door in front of us . i was momentarily confused . "
[377/1000]	she looked up at him . " what ? does it feel better because i 'm there ? is that what you wanted ? that i 'm still standing in your doorway staring at you <EOS> , feeling like a
[378/1000]	' we ca n't afford money right now , ' said oats . ' it 's probably a trap of some kind , ' said the priest dismissively . ' you can see to it with your little telescope
[379/1000]	" we 'll have to see where your mom left the next time we visit . " " go make some calls . i 'll call you first thing in the morning . " " as far as
[380/1000]	" that sounds just plain weird . " i watch as he kisses my palm . " like they did n't do that to you . for a long time , i swore i would never hurt you . i
[381/1000]	" no , love , i ca n't . if we see the next one we 'll miss it . it 's no longer a time of reflection , it 's time to find out how many of their memories
[382/1000]	she saw i was nodding , but my body did n't have the intention of moving . she thought nothing of it . she just knew she was having it . i nodded , not quite sure what to say
[383/1000]	" you know , i never knew what had happened to father , " william said , his expression suddenly pensive . he looked back toward the house with a blank expression . " we did n't know he 'd
[384/1000]	" you need to listen to me , " he said as he gripped the bars in front of him . " you are <EOS> with a prisoner of your hands . if i 'm your neighbour before i 've
[385/1000]	" okay , but not for a long time , " i said , and shook their hands . the kids shook on it . i smiled as i watched them leave . * * * *
[386/1000]	" you look really happy about it , " he muttered , lifting my hand and kissing the palm before setting it back on his chest . " i am . he 's wonderful . " " are

[388/1000]	the other boy 's name was isaac , but his had been " a little hard " when he said it , and i had n't liked him at all as it turned out . my mom was
[389/1000]	" good at being a thief for once . " " sometimes i think it 's more like a man trying to find a woman , " said ralph , who had been chewing on his fingernails for the
[390/1000]	as i passed by the water fountain , i heard him call my name . i froze . and then , just as quickly as the moment passed , i was too shocked to move . i stared
[391/1000]	" you have told me many times not to leave thee , " he said . " i did not know i could keep it from coming back , " she said . " would you go away ,
[392/1000]	" but you must n't say a word . " then she leaned forward and kissed me , soft and sweet . we were <EOS> ... her bed her head for a while . after a year for two
[393/1000]	" that must be it , " roger assured him . " but give it a while or it might find a stone and break . it might not . " he laid a hand on roger 's . "
[394/1000]	" it does take a certain amount of ingenuity to do that . " " i understand the value of that scale in a woman . " the duchess rose from the table and walked to the stone mantel
[395/1000]	" who is it ? " he called and a young man of about twenty - one or twenty - four stopped in the doorway . he had a long blond ponytail and intense blue eyes . he wore a
[396/1000]	" no . look , i do n't want him to see me like this ; it broke him . " she turned to move away . i grabbed her shoulders . " why did you come to town
[397/1000]	' i should have stayed behind to show them what to do ! ' ' i 'm only sorry that you suffered . but if i 'd known any more ... ' there was a pause . ' maybe
[398/1000]	" nothing really , " kelly mumbled . kelly blinked . " really ? " as if noticing her irritation , jon laughed lightly at something the dog said . his laugh sounded like a breeze through trees
[399/1000]	" i told you , i 'm no artist in this shop . " " ah , you think i 'm an amateur . " " no . i 'm a musician . you 've got to take
[400/1000]	" for that , i could do it . " " and even your heart can not withstand the cold . are you certain , sir , that you can do this ? " " i am certain
[401/1000]	" i will always choose my own and take your place . you are now master of your fate . i give you my seed . " the man smiled without showing his teeth . " i only
[402/1000]	the lady in black did n't hesitate at the door . " just a moment , please , " she said . " i have to look at something . " she came through the door , and
[403/1000]	" oh , you 're a great investigator ! " " nice to meet you , too , " i smiled politely . i moved toward the front door with my handbag . " so , am i
[404/1000]	" it just meant i had to do something to see it through . " " well you can finish your breakfast , as usual , and you 'd best get started if you want to be in time
[405/1000]	there was absolute nothing inside of her . she shivered at least twice as he drove inside her , over and over again . despite the heat , she would feel cold without that sensation . had she ever given
[406/1000]	an hour later , she pulled into the parking lot in the university campus . it was the same area where she 'd met with justin the night before . the car drove through un paved streets . a
[407/1000]	i stopped walking . " yeah , i guess they are , but i think we should hold off on that part . it 's never going to happen . " we turned to leave when i stopped dead mid
[408/1000]	he 's being so romantic , i think , but i ca n't say anything . my eyes never leave his beautiful face . finally , i say something . " how do you know my name ?
[409/1000]	" how 's your little girl ? " " not great . " " that explains all the phone calls i hear . " " what is the game plan ? " " a little chess
[410/1000]	" do you think he was really dead ? " i asked . she did . " do n't you ? " i decided to trust my brother . " his file says he was the ' son
[411/1000]	the other vampire with no hands touched the back of my neck , his fingers stroking through the strands . his left hand slid along my shoulder , my neck , my arm , tracing my tattoo with his fingertips
[412/1000]	i turn to the side to let the rest of them pass but one at a time , one by one , we return to the truck and we leave the van in shambles - some of the seat cushions
[413/1000]	" he does n't like it . " they made their way across the lot and under the bridge . that was the first time in her life that she 'd felt this open and vulnerable to another ,
[414/1000]	i smiled . " it 's nice of you to worry about it , but i do n't know if such things can just be experienced for one 's own benefit . " " it 's not that ,
[415/1000]	" i 'm saying you might be getting an idea of the real agenda by looking at him . and seeing that he 's a good guy , the way i see him , that 's a good chance there
[416/1000]	i shook my head . " you 're not a lawyer , and you 've never dealt with one . " " but ... i spent my fourteen years running errands for him , and i am so pretty
[417/1000]	my eyes narrowed . " a few , but how 'd you make a living as a chef if you had no morals at all ? " the guy did n't answer as he pushed his food farther up
[418/1000]	" do you think . . . " he started . the woman in the room was dead . i just could n't believe it . " does anything hurt her ? " he shook his head .
[419/1000]	he glanced into her eyes . " what do you want to do ? " she moved her head back toward her chest . " i do n't want to go anywhere , " she said . " as
[420/1000]	" you 're so cute when you blush . this is the kind of cute that convin ces me you want me . " he chuckled softly . " you already said that . " " i 'm
[421/1000]	i wanted you to know that i was very surprised when you found her . she was there and the police just informed me later . she was lying in the hospital bed , half burned to the metal by
[422/1000]	he did n't know if he could do it . he was going to try . and then he was out of the chair . he stood , swayed , and shook . his side hurt , too
[423/1000]	as all this went on i drank more cold water , and even so it was a few more hours before i even felt thirsty . i was ready to sleep and wanted to hear the kids laughing again ,
[424/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " cole whispered . " me too , " cole answered . after they had finished their meals and had had a few drinks , lily asked , " do you think
[425/1000]	he continued to watch her , his eyes hooded , seeming to hold a mixture of lust and determination . " and what do you see when you look at me ? " her answering chuckle was quiet ,
[426/1000]	" the word this has given us is ' ghost ' with a very long conno tation . " " ghost ? " " that 's what i finally got from the man who ran the camp .
[427/1000]	you 're leaving , he said in disbelief . you ca n't come . you ca n't come now . maybe i can come over when i get home . if i get there later . i do
[428/1000]	" i need a second opinion . " " me , too . this is completely new to me . " the last thing she 'd expected him to do was leave all her crap in the parking lot
[429/1000]	and then i was suddenly in the air , hanging above a small crowd that had gathered around a small body slumped on the ground . i gasped as she opened her eyes . " what happened ? "
[430/1000]	" then it 's probably best that she never hears about our little adventure tonight at the camp . " the king turned to his wife . " may i see her ? " " yes , of course
[431/1000]	" it 's to make the story more real , " jake answered . " i know ! " abby exclaimed excitedly . " who knows what stories they have with them , huh ? " when it
[432/1000]	she hesitated . " have you already written down anything we 've ordered for you ? " " yeah . " " what do you want to talk about ? " " what 's mine , you
[433/1000]	the fire had killed all the animals and were now burning . men had already jumped and were picking at the bodies . men who were alive now , thought mary . they were all in one place - the
[434/1000]	their conversation continued to lapse , then was broken by the bell ; mr. pel ham cleared his throat curtly from time to time , and the students resumed their lessons , laughing , whispering , talking . they were
[435/1000]	" i 'm sure you 're right , that 's just it . i 've never had my life changed at all before , ever , " i said sitting on the edge of the bed . " i
[436/1000]	" you can stand to work for me someday , sam . " her brow furrowed . " i ca n't stand to work for a man unless i 'm helping him run his empire and taking on the
[437/1000]	" okay . call your friend . he 'll let me know when you make the phone call . " " okay . " " bye , jess . " i started to hang up .
[438/1000]	" where is it ? " she asked . the girl pointed to a small brown sack . " i brought it yesterday when i was in the city . i really had no idea what color it was
[439/1000]	" my dad 's a big boy . he can handle it . " " he does n't need to keep going . " " you have to let him . " " maybe i will .
[440/1000]	" this is not part of our bargain , i need to know what is kept . " " you may not be in a position to ask me . i do n't know the exact details . but
[441/1000]	" the door looked better from this angle , did n't it ? so now we know we got our answer , do n't we ? " " it 's important work , boss , " gary said .
[442/1000]	she turned around and wrapped her arms around the closest part of his body . " do n't do that , " he said calmly , " unless that 's what it 's gon na take . i 'm
[443/1000]	" that sounds like them , but i am pretty sure the boy ca n't remember the last twenty years of his life . " " i was too young when the city fell . i was afraid to
[444/1000]	" not at all . i got my new friend . it was easier than i thought it would be . " so who did he have in the next room ? and what the hell had happened with
[445/1000]	her father approached him . he was a short lean man with a thinning mustache , a long pointed nose and deep blue eyes , a pale face and a thin , frail figure . his hair was grey but
[446/1000]	i laughed . " yeah , you never leave a note behind your bed . " i leaned over and kissed his cheek . he smiled and closed his eyes . " i was just thinking about our time
[447/1000]	" i think he and she became closer than they wanted to be , " i said , pointing to our left . " they 're going over the edge tonight . " " damn , i was afraid
[448/1000]	he grinned again , like he did n't care where our talk was going . if it got him off the hook , i could n't take it . shit . " i just brought you coffee .
[449/1000]	" because . " when she looked at him , he said , " i love you . " " i love you , too . i think you deserve to know , even if it 's not real
[450/1000]	not having that ... he did n't know what it would do to her . he was n't sure he could - " they gave me medication . " she lifted her chin . smiled . " i thought
[451/1000]	oh yes ... the doctor had had just the thing . he was going to change me and my life . all the while he was sitting over me like he was going to kill me . i was going
[452/1000]	she reached her back and flipped the cell phone shut . damn . " you have to go now , " she said and put it back away . why ? this feeling was going way too
[453/1000]	my hand clenched around her hand . who was this baby sister , and what did she know about my parents ? and why did she know about them ? what does she know ? why did she want me
[454/1000]	" who is it ? " he said . " it 's your ex . " as the phone was lifted , the caller 's voice was one jonathan knew . troy davis , jonathan 's father .
[455/1000]	" i 'm okay , " i said , trying hard not to tremble . in less than six hours , i 'd be gone . my life had taken an awful turn , irrevocably changed . i 'd be
[456/1000]	" not from what . from talking to me , you 'd go out on your own . " " i was home for christmas . " " you can stay as long as you want . this
[457/1000]	" see there . " he pointed and she did . " hmm , " she said when the light shone into his eyes , although that was much more difficult to see with the gloom that surrounded them
[458/1000]	" no , you do n't . those two will kill us all . " " <EOS> ... what did n't break sleep . but you wo n't kill him , and die there , do n't sleep ,
[459/1000]	" thank you . i should head home after school . " " oh , it 's cool , i 'm fine . " " great , you 're going to have to come home with me and
[460/1000]	" he came here ? " i ask , staring at the screen . " to denver ? " " yes . " i stand , leaving the chair where it has lain in a heap , and
[461/1000]	" your eyes are sparkling , " he observed . " do you like being here ? " i nodded . " you ? " " i think this mansion means a lot to me . i want
[462/1000]	" what type of a problem ? " asked the captain quietly . " what do you mean ? " " can you tell us now who the benefactor is ? " silence fell around the table
[463/1000]	she walked over and gave him the sweetest kiss on his cheek . " thank you for so much , " she said , the words coming slowly as she looked up into his eyes . his whole body
[464/1000]	i love you too . can we do this ? there was no chance of either of us getting away without some kind of fight , but he 'd told her not to go out on the streets
[465/1000]	he was still in his uniform and standing with his gun out . i noticed there was no blood on his sleeve . " where 's my dad ? " he asked , looking around . " he should know
[466/1000]	i shake my head . " nothing . " " you two seem awfully cozy . " he lifts his knee and lets out the tiniest exhale . " do you really think logan is involved with her ?
[467/1000]	i walk away , my eyes narrowed , still trying to tear my gaze from all those faces the instant that the door opens . * * * i 'm still in the alley and all i can
[468/1000]	the sound of a cell phone ringing disrupted their conversation , breaking the spell . both men turned to look at the offending sound , and the volume from her cell phone brought her back to reality with an electronic
[469/1000]	then i looked at knight 's mouth . his was now puckered in a smile , his eyes on me , soft was his best smile in the whole f * * king world . what we had was
[470/1000]	" fine , fine , " he sighed , his gaze locked on the back wall of the casino . " i 'll wear your clothes and try to give you some time to think . " " while
[471/1000]	chapter 4 i woke my next morning to sound . loud beeping noises woke me too . i sat up in bed and looked around . i was looking down at the white sheet i was lying on ,
[472/1000]	when she dropped me off on my street , i nearly threw myself into the car . i thought she was going to stay behind and talk some more but she did n't . she let me walk inside with
[473/1000]	" really ? sounds good , " he said without looking at me . " okay , listen , i had to let you know something in life without you knowing all the details . " " what 's
[474/1000]	" no ! not even a little , " nick said , holding the door open for nick . " is n't it enough that i got kicked out ? " he asked , looking out at the dark
[475/1000]	this is how you know who 's in charge sometimes , all the way out here in a place like this ? now sit down . ' henry went in the other direction , sitting at the lower edge
[476/1000]	after the third time , i get the door open , but the woman inside does n't even look at me . she just says , " oh , he can come in . " she turns on the
[477/1000]	" she will not agree with a long - term relationship between us . " he shook his head . " do not even try it . " " why should n't you try ? " damien 's fists
[478/1000]	" i did n't kill any people , " she said . " at least not yet . " " i do n't know the details of that , but it does n't seem likely that he could have
[479/1000]	" oh , yeah , " cole breathed . " right . " " we 'll finish up tomorrow after dinner , " sam said , standing . " why do n't you take him and then when you
[480/1000]	her words seemed to blow over his head at an alarming rate . they rang through his skull : he 'd been warned once ... i 'd tell you he worked for the enemy and your blood
[481/1000]	he nods , takes a seat beside me . " you guys gon na be okay with the cops ? " " we 'll stick around for a while , " i say . " i 'm just calling
[482/1000]	" it 's a party party . who are those girls ? " he had asked in passing . he had n't been a fan of the three on the front row as he had tried to make a good
[483/1000]	" it was just a little thing . " he shrugged , his arm sliding over my shoulder until he squeezed , and kissed my forehead . " i did n't want to tell you until i had had a
[484/1000]	he would have liked to think it had just been a dream , but even if he 'd been able to wake up now , his mind was too full of pain to fight off the headache that beat against
[485/1000]	" it 's my turn . i believe that . " " oh , i 'm all ears . " he leaned forward to speak softly . " i 'll take your position . " she looked at
[486/1000]	" who knows about these people in florida ? " she guessed . " someone we know . they 'd never just give up - especially with the money they usually score . they probably came up with the
[487/1000]	she was still wearing the red dress . she held out her red cape , and the purple one over it . so much for a pretty speech . " i should really get out of here , "
[488/1000]	' oh no . i 'd be happy to . ' the waiter took their order before they saw it . reuben watched as the waiter rushed off to their table . in seconds they had their wine glasses
[489/1000]	i shrugged , then held up my finger . " sorry to interrupt , but i think it 's best if i know you 're safe . " " safe from what ? what was that ? " i
[490/1000]	their mouths were n't meshed like a couple of drunken college kids , but their tongues and teeth were as intimate as ever . no , not as intimate . their tongues were very much on fire , almost too
[491/1000]	" just one thing . " i turned to face her . " what ? " " can you get your stuff together ? " " i asked him to . so what ? " i shrugged
[492/1000]	" is he gone and that big box there that i found ? " i shake my head , and there 's the smile i 've admired since birth . how can he see the emotion in me so
[493/1000]	i walked up to the desk and met with mr. stone who did n't say anything . " do you like my shirt ? " i asked him . " no , " he replied , his voice
[494/1000]	i pull over . " we have that ' please hurry ... ' shit over that . " i take out my bag and pull out the notebook , looking for her name when i see that she 's busy
[495/1000]	after my third attempt at using the tablet 's power to find information about my brother , however , my search led me back down onto the train tracks . this time there was a large sign showing
[496/1000]	" you should go home , " she whispered hoarsely . " i think you should . " i nodded . " in fact , i think i should run home . it 's not safe here . i
[497/1000]	" then what do you want me to do ? " it was a fair question . " i have a situation in town i need you to handle . " " it will take me half an
[498/1000]	her heart was pounding so hard , she thought she could hear her own feet pounding through the hardwood floor . her throat grew tight and she whispered , " i ca n't . he 's not ready , i
[499/1000]	because it 's like i 'm not thinking , which is a stupid thing to think . i hate every second of it . which is exactly what all the nurses and doctors in the ward are doing to save
[500/1000]	" please ... don't , " she begged , unable to move away . " i 'm coming , baby , " gabriel said with deep tenderness . he buried himself deeply inside her and pressed a kiss above
[501/1000]	oh , stop it ! i 'm not a child anymore ! i put together a bunch of papers in my hands . i went over to the whiteboard and wrote out a couple columns , and then i
[502/1000]	" you know , like the book with an inscription on the cover and all the others who have been killed in it , " jen said . " ya okay , " jim said sarcastically . " ya
[503/1000]	' i do n't have many girls who are old enough to be my own best friend , but do i have you ? ' he asked and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder , like it was going
[504/1000]	" have you two been out together ? " alex asked , eyeing us both carefully . " before being taken two nights ago . " so i told them , the whole truth . even though i did
[505/1000]	" but what about this woman ? " i smiled . " i love you . " sara let out a smile that was nothing short of pure happiness . she whispered , " love you , too
[506/1000]	" you believe me , then ? " i nodded again and continued to stare at the stars . i was pretty sure he would n't understand . he was as confused as i was . i wished he
[507/1000]	" the boy was n't killed because her father wants her to be , " said mr. birch and his gaze fell on sally . " they were also not found because they were not found . that is the
[508/1000]	" no , i have to take his stuff . " " sure , sure . it wo n't take long . " " that 's fine . you guys need anything else ? " " no
[509/1000]	" no , " he said , his voice still rough . " no one likes it when all the other boys hit a girl . " i felt a surge of possessiveness take me . " you 're
[510/1000]	a warm rush of sensation rushed through me in response . ethan had never given me any reason to doubt him before . but maybe he was right . maybe being on their bad side still unsettled me . and
[511/1000]	i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to upset you . " i shrug , finally meeting his gaze . " no worries , it 's okay . i need help for the kids , so it 's
[512/1000]	she 'd thought he might laugh at her . so even as she thought about it she knew she was lying . the way he looked at her , his deep emerald eyes hot and seductive , made her ache
[513/1000]	there are many types of people : those who are tough , with a cold - blooded quality about them , and those who are n't so smart . not only are they highly proficient in combat , they are
[514/1000]	" now what was that i just heard ? " ty asked in mock alarm and pointed to his head with his finger . " what are you talking about ? " he asked . " that said
[515/1000]	" you 're with the army ? ! " " the order of the blood and the blood of the children of god . i 've always cared for them , if you can believe that . " the
[516/1000]	" then why are you here ? " he demanded , the irritation still evident in his voice . " you know why , " i answered . " you 'd better explain . " " all
[517/1000]	" uh , i do n't know . i remember dad talking about how the king of kings thought he 'd come down here in search of women , but now he 's not coming . " " he
[518/1000]	" yes ! oh , my , " he said in a trembling voice that seemed to come from inside his chest . " yes . " with his fingers , he gently stroked my cheek . " it is
[519/1000]	" wait , " she wailed . " you do not have to do this . i know this upsets you , i see it in your face , but - " " have you heard one word i
[520/1000]	" no , just to tell the man i 'm working on . " " ok . give me your phone . " " i do n't have it . " officer smith put a hand up
[521/1000]	" no , you 'll get a nasty bump today , " i said , my stomach twisting with worry . " it 's just an old bruise . " he stared at me , like he did n't
[522/1000]	his eyes moved to mine but he did n't speak . " i got about a hundred people , " he said quietly . " and ? " my voice was a whisper . " you needed
[523/1000]	" you ca n't be so dense , " he said brusquely . the rest of the night was spent on talking and staring at the moon . " that 's weird ... " a thought flashed into
[524/1000]	" i know , " kate said . " it 's not a good time . " " it 's a bit late to be taking orders from me , not to mention mr. stone 's little friend .
[525/1000]	" this is him ? " " that 's mr. patterson , " i said . " did you call him ? " " i ca n't right now , but that 's okay . "
[526/1000]	i know i should be offended but they have gotten worse for me . they say that 's a lesson to you , and one i do not want to take away . they tell me that being a bitch
[527/1000]	he takes a step backwards and his grip on her body loosens . he steps away from her , looking confused . i 've got to stop him . now . i 'm feeling sick inside . this kind
[528/1000]	" ok , here we go . " he said . we both got up and walked down the street , walking away from the party . we took a last look over our shoulders as we walked down
[529/1000]	" you 've seen the papers , right ? every time the news shows come out , you 'll see that the killer was the murderer ! " " they 've got pictures of him in newspapers , "
[530/1000]	" just me and no other . " " do you want me to run off and get a beer or something ? " " no thank you . will you do me a favor ? "
[531/1000]	" what was that about ? " " i think the first lady and her servant are hiding something from you , but it 's not really an important item , but the other two things , they 're
[532/1000]	i watched him move his arms up and down her back , and i looked back at the scene in the kitchen . the tears were flowing down her face and i could see a piece of her past as
[533/1000]	in addition , she did not mention the word " sex . " which was fine with him ; it meant he 'd get all the gory details later . but she was n't a girl . he wanted
[534/1000]	" you look just like her . " i smiled shyly . " she has white hair and green eyes . " " and she was a good nurse too , " he said turning me toward him
[535/1000]	" we 'll be fine , " i said . " i know this spot . " my fingers had become numb from cold , and they shook , pulling at the silk of my dress . he moved a
[536/1000]	" you still think i 'm the stalker ? " i let the question hang . " well ... yeah . but ... " " i can be sure of my ability to be certain of your ability
[537/1000]	" what do you think of that ? maybe we should let him keep on pretending like nothing happened . " " i mean , in fact , that 's highly unlikely , " jane said . " they
[538/1000]	" when did you - " " do you know where she is ? i went to the police , but all they could tell me was she was in a psychiatric ward . her doctor assured me she
[539/1000]	it 's the very best we 've got at this point , and we have a whole lot to learn . " although , i thought that she probably would have better luck at getting any new clients for
[540/1000]	" uh , i have n't had my eggs yet . " " i can make you plate , " he said , his hand cupping her elbow . " do you wish to make them now ? "
[541/1000]	" why is that ? " alex insisted . she shrugged . " it 's just different to be sure . " " what 's different ? " his brows scrunched together she glanced over at him
[542/1000]	the truth was he should have been mad at himself . after all , he 'd lost this , too - their only chance to get back at the things they 'd done to rose . " then why did
[543/1000]	* * * the three of them had been working two days a week since i started dropping out , working an extra hour each . i 'd had a couple people go home from the library working late
[544/1000]	" here 's the best part , " he said . " we never have to worry about this meeting . there is no one else . if it had n't been for my family , the judge and the
[545/1000]	" yes . " " i can tell they do n't believe me . " " you did n't say they were the ones who had to go to the store today . " " i did
[546/1000]	' is this what you wanted to know ? ' asked jason , beginning to understand how the other was speaking . ' yes , it is . it 's our best strategy , and i think it 's
[547/1000]	" now , now , there is no need of that , " he objected dismissively , giving no other way of explaining his concern . " the matter has been settled . mr. mac gregor has left to go
[548/1000]	" i can feel it . it 's strange , but it 's comforting . like i do n't even have to talk to your parents anymore . " i thought about the people i 'd met , talking
[549/1000]	" we 're up there , " logan said , his gaze falling on the building . it was a little different from what he 'd seen on that day the dead woman had died , the building being close
[550/1000]	" sure , let 's take a look at the other half . " they walked back through the tunnel to the bottom . " there 's one entrance right beside it , " sal said . "
[551/1000]	the door chimed softly and the next moment it opened . i turned fully to see a small , tan woman , wearing a flowered sundress and looking to be about my age , with very dark brown hair
[552/1000]	" it seems so , " nate agreed , " but i 've been getting your texts . i 'm pretty sure they 're not random . " " it makes sense to text you when someone is harassing
[553/1000]	" yeah , i got it . " " i 'll send the money for a loan . " " uh - huh , " she said , her eyes still on her phone . the guy
[554/1000]	but the moment she had said " no " , she had n't said no any more , either - he saw the answer in her lovely , clear eyes , and once again he was shocked . no
[555/1000]	" you said you 'd try to help her , " tavi said . " what are you looking for ? " " if that tub of water ever got cold enough to hold those bloody water demons to
[556/1000]	i shook my head and laughed , unable to resist the urge to smile . " i wish i could be as good as you . " " good . because if you are not me , then you
[557/1000]	" i know , " i sighed . " but it was hard . and i was n't ready to leave again before you did . i do n't normally run , or do things like that . but that
[558/1000]	" my parents are n't aware of this . my parents took me up to montana once they heard that my dad was dead . they thought it was because i did n't want to marry him , a jerk
[559/1000]	" how 's your dad ? " trevor asked . " busy , " she said with a smile . " it 's been too long . " " are you still thinking about going to school ?
[560/1000]	she 'd forgotten the story was true . she had forgotten the long , torturous process of trying to create a life as a free woman . that she should find him as attractive as he found her was n't
[561/1000]	" she 's fine , " grace said , not looking at him so she could see the concern that filled his eyes . " but you look terrible .... " " i 'm fine . we 're
[562/1000]	i could not believe it . my ears were buzzing as i watched to see what he would do next . as the guy took the knife and put it to the neck of the younger man , i jumped
[563/1000]	all i wanted to do was turn around and walk back to where i came from , and why i was here . to hide my heartache from him as long as possible . he kept staring at me
[564/1000]	" does he really think we 're friends ? " the queen asked . she looked at the prince for an answer , the prince did n't know , but the queen nodded . " for how long ?
[565/1000]	" you need to know what i made of it , " she said , referring to the day when i saw her alone on the street , alone with her old gun . " and you made me
[566/1000]	her shoulders were a bit hunched as she tried to stretch the tight muscles in her legs . once it became apparent she was being watched , a smile appeared on his face and for a moment , he
[567/1000]	" are you okay ? " " i 'm fine . i 'm just - i 'm hungry . " he nods , and we pick up the pace of the dance . i have no idea where
[568/1000]	she said , " i would understand if you were asking me for a loan , mr. baley , for it is what you would do . " baley replied , " why should i be asking you for
[569/1000]	" i 'll wear a green shirt with silver skulls and cross bones , " he said . " ' tis a mighty gift , master , " said his master . " wear it well . "
[570/1000]	" no . " after several minutes , i stood up and walked over to where she was already seated on the couch , trying to keep myself in line with all the other girls in the room .
[571/1000]	" she 'll be just fine in my apartment . " " you 're so arrogant . " he smiled at her , his eyes still holding secrets , and leaned back , stretching out on the bed
[572/1000]	" good evening , sir , " said the receptionist . " allow me . " the doorman led them to a nearby elevator . " sir , we 've already taken care of your request , " said
[573/1000]	" i do n't know , " i answered , closing my eyes and sucking back more of the pain . " those would be the other side . " * * * we 'd hung out in
[574/1000]	" it is n't , " he said , sounding weary . " i remember when they got rid of my mother - and still have nightmares about her - and they were just waiting for the opportunity to do
[575/1000]	that had n't been what i 'd meant , but there was nothing else i could do about it . an hour later , i was driving through downtown louisville ; the neighborhood i lived in was one of
[576/1000]	" what are my abilities ? " i asked in confusion . he said , " i know your name , what your thoughts , your personality , your power . what you want to do is very simple
[577/1000]	her hand shook , cold as a cold hand upon her mouth . then the figure turned slowly , her face drawn in a grim mask of loathing , her eyes blazing with hate . her mask of hate
[578/1000]	before i could ask of him the exact thoughts that filled my mind , he said , " please tell me you did n't think i was giving them a chance because i do n't do virgins ? "
[579/1000]	" he is , " zane agreed . " he 's also one of you . " " shut up , " ty snarled . zane raised an eyebrow at the obvious anger in ty 's voice .
[580/1000]	it will keep , if i have to leave this place to keep a vigil for thousands of people going to war , who knows ? it has to ... i must keep reminding myself . i will force myself
[581/1000]	" i know how you work . " she went over to him and laid her hand on his cheek . he 'd always done his best to make her smile . " are you out of your mind or
[582/1000]	she said , " do n't you see ? the people that keep all the food and drink hidden are criminals like us . they must have a hand print or a photograph of you . it was probably left
[583/1000]	the man who 'd done it has already proven him a bastard . she might never remember them , but she could find them . " stop . " " no . " " please . let
[584/1000]	chapter four : a voice " is n't this better than being at home ? " natalie said as she shut her bedroom door behind her and strolled out into the bright garden . it was a peaceful
[585/1000]	he heard himself say , " i 'll tell them to go to hell and that it 's your job to make sure that happens . " " i 'll keep watch and cover any doors and windows .
[586/1000]	the doors to the back room swung open . she was out of breath and the hair on her arms was rising again , but she ignored it , not wanting to deal with it right then . she
[587/1000]	in fact , it was beginning to sound as if he was a real little boy . maybe he was . it was hard to have that hoped for but it was possible he was really just as good as
[588/1000]	" did he say ? " i ask , opening the door . she does n't answer , just nods wordlessly . " the truth of the matter is i do n't know . " she gives me one of
[589/1000]	you can hear how wrong that is ? something about the way he said it - the way he said it , the way he looked at me as if i were nothing at all . it brings me to
[590/1000]	but i was wrong . now i had her mouth firmly wrapped around my cock and her tongue rolling against the underside of the tip , she was just as greedy and taking as i was . i gritted my
[591/1000]	two of each week on tues days each year , after a busy week at the office , i was given a class on " how to be a man . " i worked the rest of the week after
[592/1000]	i gasped , feeling the soft touch of her tongue against my skin as she slid the silky silk of my shirt aside . oh my god . i 'm not gon na f * * king be able
[593/1000]	" yes , so , you 're sorry ? " " no , it 's nothing . " " did you hear what she said , tom ? you are really sorry ? " the questions were coming
[594/1000]	" well , i told her that if she talked to me , i would do what she said and she 's out of her mind . " i smiled at the idea . i do n't think she even
[595/1000]	" so you two are n't planning on hooking up with each other ? " she blinked up at me in surprise . " the whole world 's too damn focused on not hav * * g s * x
[596/1000]	ethan had n't spoken in decades . but he was n't wrong about that . pilcher shook up his glass . he raised his glass . he said , " to new beginnings . " they
[597/1000]	" what 's the matter , dear ? " said mrs. ma honey , as though she had guessed . " we 're probably all in a good bit of danger right now if this goes through . you keep
[598/1000]	i tried to sit up , but a hand grasped my arm and jerked as kaspar brought his head on , so quickly that i had no time to react . the body slammed into me , face first ,
[599/1000]	but it was n't . i put on the coat i did n't have at the time and grabbed a box of kleenex to wipe my eyes dry . when i got back into the apartment building my family was
[600/1000]	" i remember the first time i did that , " he said . " i remember it too . " " i still do n't understand why you were willing to commit so horrible a crime .
[601/1000]	" what are you up to , little girl ? " whispered a voice from across the room . " nothing , mom . i 'm just playing hide and seek with a bunch of kids . "
[602/1000]	" a vampire , " i said as the words came out . the idea of a werewolf was all kinds of ridiculous . " the one you killed ? " " yes , " i nodded .
[603/1000]	so , what 's happened ? ok , i 'll go on . you tell me . but hurry it up , we do n't want to be late . ok , i 'll wait while you run
[604/1000]	the old man looked up , his eyes widening for a second , as if he had said something to scare someone . or maybe he had said something he did n't really want anyone to know . or
[605/1000]	i shook my head . " you are such a smart - ass . " rolling his eyes , he leaned back in his chair and reached for his glasses . " thanks . i like my new -
[606/1000]	" yes , i am . " she smiled at him reassuringly , and he relaxed . he came down a few minutes later , wet hair stuck to his face . " i 'll be up ' till
[607/1000]	although she was certain , he 'd made sure a certain amount of paperwork was available . in any case , he made sure that everything was ready for the next day 's run . he had no intention of
[608/1000]	" thank you , " i murmur , letting her go . when she turns away , i turn to head to my second stop in this long line . i hear two voices behind me . my first
[609/1000]	" we should n't have come , " said peter . " i do n't see why not , " said bruce , leading the way . they passed several houses before bruce suddenly stopped . they stopped
[610/1000]	" are you sure , princess ? i do n't relish the thought of you being in bed with him for - " " his name is not nox . stop pretending you do n't know his real name
[611/1000]	* * * i sit down at my desk and finish my third degree thesis . i wonder if he has any idea that i 'm studying to be an architect at the university of kentucky . i wonder
[612/1000]	her words cut straight through him . " you ca n't want me . you do n't even have to hurt me , " he said , hating himself for what he was about to say . he was starting
[613/1000]	" we will n't know until we 've had time to know each other better . " " i know we will , " she said . " but what about tomorrow ? " " we 'll get
[614/1000]	" do their things and prepare the family room for the party . " " sure . " " we have a chef . " i took a step back , shocked . i had only heard
[615/1000]	" you know what ? " she said . " it 's quite fascinating how much her reaction makes me want to stick to my guns . " she did n't turn around . now he could hear her
[616/1000]	" no but he did have that nice voice , i hope it 's not too bad . " he said and in a softer voice added , " for a short while i felt better , not knowing what
[617/1000]	" i know . i 'm being a selfish bastard . i 'm supposed to be giving you this night and making you come . not this . " he kissed me quickly . " one more time .
[618/1000]	" well ... " he muttered . " yeah , my name is alex " he said , then his jaw clenched . " i 'm an enforcer . " " i 'm sarah 's boyfriend " sam echoed
[619/1000]	" no , " the woman said after seeing ellie . " that 's the whole story . ellie started your business as a model . but after she came to see your father and they saw how poor you
[620/1000]	" i hate that she 's going through this , " i said , then looked down . " you can tell me , " he said . " please . " the intensity in his face would
[621/1000]	i 'm just happy that they 're back , too . i keep saying that , but only right . i see that john and evan are also standing on the hillside . kevin is out there . " where
[622/1000]	" oh , " he said . " i suppose so . " " she 'll say , ' now get off my property and never come back ' or something like that , " i said , sounding
[623/1000]	" what about our history of torture and pain of this point in time ? the three of them think these two things can be related but we have proof that the two subjects are as good as one and
[624/1000]	she dropped the book as he came into the room . " sorry , " he said with a laugh . " just trying to give you a massage . " " you did a lot better than my
[625/1000]	chapter thirty - four " have you had your morning coffee yet ? " charlie asked . " no . " " since the last thing i want to do today is wake up and see my
[626/1000]	" i bet it does , " she said with a laugh . " i 'd better explain what 's going on . do you remember what happened last night ? " he leaned forward and reached for his
[627/1000]	now my stomach turned . i could only hope that had n't made things worse for mom . ' where 's gran ? ' i whispered to sam as he came up the stairs carrying someone 's bag and
[628/1000]	the night air was quiet , he noticed . no chirp of crickets . nothing . behind them , someone was crying . " hush , " he whispered to daisy , trying not to be heard .
[629/1000]	" the truth ? " " oh , no , you do n't get it . " the corner of his mouth got into a nasty twist . " i have n't taken life seriously for a while now
[630/1000]	" and you think you can manage that ? " " not if only from my side , " said dezh nev , with a kind of grimace of irritation . " i 'm not much good at working
[631/1000]	" i love it , mrs. coughlin . " " so do i , and the sooner you 'll get down to business , the better it will be for everyone . " he held the folder and
[632/1000]	" did i hit you ? have you lost your mind ? " " oh , i knew when you came on the bus , i knew you were hot . " " oh , please . "
[633/1000]	" i do n't think so . these are people who could end the world and live perfectly happy lives . who do you think is next ? do they know what you 're going to do ? " he
[634/1000]	a minute later , though , i saw her smile all the way across the room . she stood up with a little twirl and waved , and i wanted to kiss her so bad i thought i would n't
[635/1000]	" yeah , i know you do . i saw your boyfriend make a pass at me this week . " i held her gaze and tried to control my scowl . " uh - oh . something 's
[636/1000]	but i do . " " why ... why would you say something like that ? " " oh , to be honest , i was on a date with him before he took me over . i
[637/1000]	" now just that . " she said . " i like the other two . " she offered , hoping i would take the hint . i gave her an appreciative look , and she blushed . "
[638/1000]	" yes , i do . " he said softly , " i think there 's something we need to discuss . " she nodded . " right now ? " she asked . he shrugged .
[639/1000]	there 's a thud , and i stand there with my ears ringing . the lights flicker off and on for a few moments before coming back on and lighting up the entire room as if we had just been
[640/1000]	there was another knock at the door . " i 'm ready , " replied michael , standing to his feet . the door opened and in walked two men ; both had a bag over their shoulders
[641/1000]	i was already headed into the foyer , so i just waved him on by . his gaze followed me and stayed with me , so i could almost feel his stare burning into me . i moved through
[642/1000]	chapter 2 it was the end of that day , and i was sitting in the front row , staring out the window , when i remembered that i 'd forgotten to bring my gun around . so i
[643/1000]	" thank you , " they said , agreeing to meet . " did n't they tell you that you belong to a different family ? " i shook my head , still unable to comprehend what they were
[644/1000]	he turned and offered his hand to guide her back toward her house , " come on . it 's not bad enough that i find you wearing nothing but something you could n't put in the trunk of a
[645/1000]	" not to worry , " his grandmother said with a shake of her head . " everything is going well . " he was n't so sure about that . as far as he had anyone to share
[646/1000]	" for what it 's worth , you did n't strike me as an easy worker around here . do n't get me wrong ; i 'm glad i 'm here , but most of these people will probably kill
[647/1000]	" this is not a time to joke , " she said quickly before he had to elaborate . " it 's the anniversary of your death , and you 're putting your family at risk . " "
[648/1000]	" that 's not possible , " i whispered as i looked at the dark room around me . there was no sign of him anywhere , so i asked officer may er what i could do to get out
[649/1000]	" i was ... sorry about ... my brother . " " oh no , no , i think you should be sorry for everything , " he said . " especially for that . and for your friend
[650/1000]	" of course , " she mutters , her eyes drifting to mine . her expression is one of puzzlement . i do n't share it with her . " yeah , you should talk , " i
[651/1000]	" there will be no arguing with me and we should both be grateful that we wo n't die of something we had no part in killing . the matter has come to my attention that we are looking for
[652/1000]	he shook his head and kissed my nose , smiling and the smile was back . " we 're going to have a good time . we 'll take care of our father , and i 'll make sure that
[653/1000]	" so ? you have a better one ? " " sure . " she shrugged . " but it does n't mean i need one . " " why not ? " she lifted one shoulder
[654/1000]	my head jerks up . " what ? " i gasp , my fingers automatically flying to my neck . " he was hurt ... last night . where are you ? " and he told her
[655/1000]	my hand landed on the paper again where a name popped up . i snatched my hand away and read from it : for you , baby . i folded it in half and tucked it into my
[656/1000]	his fingers squeezed mine . my heart began to beat again . " and you ? " " and me . we 've got to hurry . " chapter nine after the big display - and our
[657/1000]	his head was in a slump , and he took time to recover . after everything , he 'd barely registered the sound of the footsteps disappearing through the front door . he was shaking with the effort
[658/1000]	" she ca n't work at the hospital , " i stated . " she does n't even have a job . " " do n't worry . i 'll take care of her . " he sounded
[659/1000]	" they asked for our blood . " she said into the phone . " i 'm going to go to the hospital with them . " he did n't speak . he just did n't want her to go
[660/1000]	he picked up a small pot filled with burning white - hot coals and placed it next to a small pot of water . he quickly set the pot aside , gathered up some kindling from nearby and held the
[661/1000]	" do you mind ? " he said . " i need a few drinks . " " all right then . " she pushed open the door . " you know where you can find me . "
[662/1000]	" i 'm afraid that 's the penalty it is , i suppose , captain , " general den br ough said primly . the other man put his hand to his mouth and laughed , then continued in
[663/1000]	' now . ' and we 'd be right back where we started ; the whole of the city would be right back where we started . because in the end , and more importantly for the most part -
[664/1000]	" you really wo n't believe it ? " " what ? " " i was a virgin when i was first - " " of course you were , " i interrupted . " the girls
[665/1000]	" i could make you pay . i could make you watch in your window . " his threat is meant as a threat to me but i resist as long as i possibly can . i 'm worried
[666/1000]	they were just talking at this point and i heard a sound i could n't remember hearing in all the years since . the sound that i knew was the sound of someone coming towards me . it was muffled
[667/1000]	" go on ! " a few moments went by while the two stared at each other in silence . luke turned to look behind him to where luke had been sitting and saw that he was gone .
[668/1000]	i nodded into his mouth . " i 'm sorry . " i pulled away another few inches and tried to kiss him . just before it got too much , he stopped me mid - kiss with
[669/1000]	" i was just thinking that maybe - just maybe - there 's something weird about you and me . that 's all , really . i mean , what 's the point of him dying ? for all i
[670/1000]	" as a good brother , i wish you the best of luck , " she said , and then turned , put her arm around sam , and headed to the door . " you 're coming with
[671/1000]	" the other night you said exactly what i 'd said you 'd say . if it was me , would that make it worse ? you said i 'd fight dirty with you . now i have to fight
[672/1000]	he shook his head . " i 'm crazy about you , ari . a lot of girls would n't have even to ask . if you 're like me and do n't want to leave , can you wait
[673/1000]	" and ? " when she looked up at him , he had his hands propped in his lap . there was a smile on his face now , one she could never have gotten out of a book .
[674/1000]	" sure , i get it . " " where would you like me to start ? " " um , uh . . . " okay , there was this first time that mike did n't ask
[675/1000]	" do n't take this the wrong way , but what did you have planned last night ? " my mind whirled with all of a sudden . " at one point , you mentioned a date , and
[676/1000]	" i 'm not having anyone else ... come on , i am . " " damn . " " it 's not like it 'll happen again . so get over it . " " oh
[677/1000]	he pulled away . " what ? " she almost shouted . " i can be gentle . <EOS> ... the way you can sing for the days after i can tell you to sleep . you 've
[678/1000]	" he wo n't ever put it past javier to kill him and now you worry for our safety . you are very special to him . " i nodded , " i know . i do n't
[679/1000]	" well , i do know who came out of the desert with a bomb in the trunk . the bad guy , a guy who killed just about everyone he met , who had an arsenal of weapons ,
[680/1000]	" stop this , " i demanded as she yanked me through the kitchen door and down the hall . " get in the car and drive to denver . we 're coming back , " she ordered after
[681/1000]	his eyes widen . " seriously ? " " yeah , " i say reluctantly . " i was going to ask you to ask my mom if she could keep the baby . " " no way
[682/1000]	" thanks , " i said . i wished he 'd pull the gun off me . what was i thinking , waiting around to do nothing ? he was armed , obviously . he could shoot . the only
[683/1000]	he pulled her into his arms . " i promise . " what did that mean ? " come on . let 's make amends . " she gestured toward the door . he still had plans
[684/1000]	" look , mr. morgan , i 'm not a person of great wisdom , but i am aware of your situation and the needs of the court . perhaps if i had , please call upon a judge for
[685/1000]	" what makes you do that ? " " did you see how beautiful the house at my place is ? " " that 's me . " " would you like to turn over ? "
[686/1000]	" what the hell are you talking about , jake ? " " nothing . he knows everything , is going to show up . " " i 'm talking about julie who 's really in vegas .
[687/1000]	" my husband would n't like it . " " do you want him found ? should i tell the press ? " " i 'll let him decide . " " i saw something in your
[688/1000]	" a little , " mrs. bethany said in a way that would have made a good - bye party on sale look kind of sad if she had a brain with a brain . " but i 'll keep
[689/1000]	as i got ready to leave , a knock sounded at the front door . i opened the door . " hi , " i said . " hi . " she did n't sound any more enthusiastic
[690/1000]	<EOS> , you 've only known me for a week and you 're already going to do that , are n't you ? how stupid do you think i am ? but my mind 's racing with the possible ramifications
[691/1000]	" what ? " she shook her head . " you were having an intimate moment right in front of everyone . they all know you and i . " he looked at her from beneath his lashes
[692/1000]	was all a lie . it was the reason why i could n't help taking money from their boyfriends - i could n't help myself , but what if their parents knew ? no way do i want them to
[693/1000]	" i have no idea . that 's all true . " " you have some very solid ideas about this , " he pointed out . after some long moments , he told her another of his ideas
[694/1000]	" what happened ? " ivy 's voice called from the living room . " what on earth are they trying to eat ? " " i wanted to sit with him , " sarah explained , sitting at
[695/1000]	" good god , " i whispered , pushing gently on her back because i was n't sure that she understood what was happening . " help ! " she screamed , getting to her feet and dashing to
[696/1000]	" i 'm with him right now " , said tobias . " oh , " i said . " oh yeah , sorry . i did n't mean to ... " " it 's fine , "
[697/1000]	the black man moved toward her , his hand opening and closing around the bottle . " i hate your guts , " zane growled from the other side of the phone and he hit the speed dial for
[698/1000]	i told her i love you , i know , you were the best , there 's no reason to keep talking like this . you 're a beautiful girl and you 're the most beautiful part of me .
[699/1000]	the lights flickered on , creating a sickly orange glow on the other woman . she closed her eyes and the scene went black . chapter 17 the noise was even louder there in her dungeon , but
[700/1000]	i shook my head , thinking again for a moment . on the one hand i wished they had run away , and , on the other , if we had fought any real battles i would have given out
[701/1000]	" so we 're not dead either ? " she asked . " we 're dead , you and me , " i said . " but we 're still here and we still want to be . "
[702/1000]	" of course . i am . he 's a terrific guy . " " you 're doing the right thing , tully . he 's all right . and you 're welcome to a few things you may
[703/1000]	i looked into his eyes . they were full of ... fear . i gulped . " are you okay ? " he nodded and we both moved away from the house . i turned to see who
[704/1000]	" how you talking to your wife ? " a gruff grunt came from behind him . " i was listening ; we been over this three times already . talk . " silence . " i
[705/1000]	" you would be right about one thing , " she said . " the girls who do n't wear collars do n't wear very often , either . " he nodded . " i can see that .
[706/1000]	" it 's all right , sir . i have taken care of it . " " good , " said lord vetinari . he turned to nobby . " well , if you change your mind ... "
[707/1000]	chapter seventeen " but he left , " said simon , and i sat in silence , watching him at the sink as he finished the water and dumped each water bottle into the dishwasher . " maybe
[708/1000]	but that could change . " " no . we 'll be free . " when lucas looked at her like that , his gaze felt even more hungry on her , taking everything in . like she
[709/1000]	" i just left some things in the kitchen . " his nose wrinkled and he rubbed his palm gently on his chin . it was n't enough that the kitchen smelled delicious . it reminded me of his
[710/1000]	i smiled . " yeah , i 'm up to the challenge . " i tilted my head as i looked around . some people were just out . another was out doing a little thing " making a fool
[711/1000]	i looked at the floor . i could n't tell what kind of damage the girl 's body would cause . i was only able to think of her one time . the moment of tears i had n't let
[712/1000]	" no , you do n't , princess . " " you are , " she said , giving him a single fierce glare . " it is not an insult , for when you leave me ...
[713/1000]	" i 'm gon na have to go and run up to the porch . i 've got to turn my calls back on . and i have to say thank you , for the flowers , " she added
[714/1000]	his arms went around her . " how ? how did you know ? " she shrugged . " i was n't even aware of it . but people had to say it . you know how people are
[715/1000]	so it 's only about four weeks before the next full moon . tomorrow we 'll be able to go out into the graveyard and talk . i 'll tell you everything . i promise . " he 'd
[716/1000]	he gave her a grin , his eyes suddenly warming and his hand moving to cup her jaw . leaning back , he looked at his menu and commented , " i 'll have a roast pork on a bag
[717/1000]	it 's so hard to believe that i do n't have any of the pieces . chapter 5 i do n't know how much time passes before i open my eyes and peek across the bed at echo
[718/1000]	it is the most awful morning <EOS> the day of the day in which it 's sunday that they have met all week , over and over again . the best of them all , the most lovely of
[719/1000]	she nodded and smiled . ' i 'll come too . ' they shook hands , then returned to the car and rode it back to the restaurant . as the car drew level with the restaurant on the
[720/1000]	" stop , " he murmured to the girl . you can not be thinking this way . you are never going to be brave enough to go into his shoes if you continue . you know that . he
[721/1000]	" ok then , " she agreed , " i will follow up on that because you said you wanted to chat for a minute , okay ? " " ok , " he agreed . " what sort
[722/1000]	" have a seat , " he said . " there 's a little more inside . " and he made himself comfortable on the couch , leaving his old sofa and armchair off to the side beside the
[723/1000]	" just a moment . excuse me ? " chapter 25 " oh my god . " ashley whispered , as she broke her arm and rubbed at the healing , angry flesh . " the demon ...
[724/1000]	you . " he grabbed an empty coke bottle and tossed it across the room . " so what do you say ? " " i do n't know . " " i 'll take you .
[725/1000]	but he did n't , because he could n't have planned this long . it changed everything . " i thought you left your own damn name . i thought you were out of reach or ... or a prisoner
[726/1000]	now this young man . where had she found a man like him ? a single man ? his presence was so strong that it intimidated her , and yet he made her feel safe and desired , as if
[727/1000]	you 're too sweet , and i ca n't even give you the best ? " lily sighed . " come inside , and i 'll give you a tour , " she said excitedly . " i
[728/1000]	' so , it 's like a sort of a conspiracy , is it ? ' i am tempted to ask him to clarify his perspective more , but then it would be too revealing . ' in that case
[729/1000]	my head shot up . " if you need to talk - " " later tonight , " he said , sounding exhausted . " i got ta get ready . " " then get ready to leave
[730/1000]	it was n't going to be easy to get to the station . i had plenty of other options to try and get away . if you were an escort or an escort , your car was usually parked at
[731/1000]	he reached out and shook her hand . " they were your boys , not mine . " ellie shook hard . " i guess . " he felt like she was rejecting his hand .
[732/1000]	" well , she can stay . she 's more than welcome , " i say to mom when dad takes a little breath . " she sleeps with the kids . " i 'm only half kidding .
[733/1000]	not everyone 's parents were that strict . but you never knew during the growing up period . " i guess , " i said wryly . this was exactly why i did n't want to go to high
[734/1000]	he sat back against the pillows , a confused expression on his face . " for what ? " she shrugged . " for what i was going to ask . " he shifted slightly , and his
[735/1000]	his voice was so low i could almost pretend i did n't know him . " i know . what happened was an accident . i was really upset by what i 'd just seen , even though i
[736/1000]	" all right , ladies . it 's only one bar . " we 're at the one in the dark with no lights and only a couple of guys . one of them is about my age and
[737/1000]	there must be some chance we could make a jump to new york . if i 'm going , we should do both . " " there 's still a chance you might get caught , " he reminded
[738/1000]	" what was that ? " i ask . he looks me in the eye . " that might be why i ca n't . i keep waking up in this hotel , and they 're telling me to
[739/1000]	" i 'm just about done , " i said . " you 're better than this . " i nodded . he handed me a white t - shirt for the bruise . i reached up and
[740/1000]	" then do a better job . " his mind raced . all his time was in the water . the tide was coming in . he had to get out . but he had to take care
[741/1000]	" i imagine you 're right , lord hunter " , said his wife . " his holiness is in town and wants to see you at once . " " perhaps " , said hunter , looking around
[742/1000]	she watched my face when she said , " and how did you know i did n't have a ring ? " i shrugged and said , " your phone vibrated early this afternoon . i thought you might
[743/1000]	i opened my mouth to say i was the one on the phone , but i stopped , because not wanting to draw attention to myself , i asked , " are you still there ? i just want to
[744/1000]	" all i want is to hear that she 's happy . " " she was n't happy with me . " " and now she 's happier with her sister . " " how do you
[745/1000]	" this is great . " beth smiled at him . " my name is beth . i need to talk to you about something . it 's important . " beth had a feeling it was an important conversation
[746/1000]	something tickled her nose as she came up behind the guy like a dog wanting to lick a steak . then a hand closed over her arm and spun her around so fast the light caught her off guard .
[747/1000]	" but he was good at it ! " " if you want him to keep it . " " but you ... you said you wanted me to stay with you . " " i did
[748/1000]	i feel horrible " the boy " by j. t. burton <EOS> good , " ' it keeps your friend . " he wants to hear no more than three minutes , then , " i want to know how
[749/1000]	" i 'll give you five minutes . " he pulled himself to his feet . " thank you for your time . " he pointed to the door . " use them wisely . " and with a wink
[750/1000]	" yes , " ethan said weakly . " it was her . " " that 's what i thought , " helen said and patted his upper arm . " thank you , " claire whispered .
[751/1000]	he did n't bother to try to sound offended . " well , we have a few drinks to celebrate . " " i know . " it slipped out . then he looked down at his phone ,
[752/1000]	" his highness , " ra sho dd said with a smile . " i am one of his advi sers now . " " i know , " ra sho dd said , flashing another smile . "
[753/1000]	" have you any questions ? " he asked . " no , " i said . " we leave in an hour for some work . " he nodded . " all right . let 's go
[754/1000]	i look up from the kitchen table and raise one eyebrow at him . " oh , nothing . just ... busy seeing you ! " " yeah . busy . " he starts rinsing our plates .
[755/1000]	" because - " " because you can go against everything i care about , just like the rest of the freaking world . " " if you hurt me , " she told him in a hard
[756/1000]	' what 's up , kid ? ' asked mitch when i 'd finished again and the conversation had turned to more interesting stuff . ' the police have been trying to reach me . i dropped the phone
[757/1000]	" what is it ? " said heather . she could n't get up from the floor . " she 's lost a lot of blood . she ca n't talk . " " okay , " cried
[758/1000]	" not really , " she said . " it was really my fault . i told him i wanted to be friends , and i 'm sorry . i did . but it was n't meant as a line
[759/1000]	" at least when you 're with me , any woman would die of craving for this man ! " a soft snort escaped with his muttered confession . when she opened her eyes , he was only a
[760/1000]	" is that so ? " it was . " i 've never been with a man like you . " his brows shot up , and he smiled at me . " well , you and the
[761/1000]	" where is he ? i have to find him , " i said . all around us the people that had been gathered around started murmuring , and i knew that this was not good . as we began
[762/1000]	" god , this morning 's been too long , i would give anything to see your face , " he said softly , his voice deeper than usual . i hesitated , then gave him the scoop .
[763/1000]	" what did i do to make you hate me so much ? " i ask her , when i finally speak . a look of guilt suddenly falls across her face . " you did n't do anything
[764/1000]	i sat there , wondering why i was doing this . maybe i needed to see if i could feel anything through the bond . " gemma , it 's me , " nicholas said in a voice that
[765/1000]	" you need to be there . and i need you there . " he took her hand in his , and it was cold . but then a shiver moved through her as his fingers wrapped around hers
[766/1000]	she stood , then held up a finger to silence him . she could n't face him . if he left , she did n't know how she would deal with the embarrassment . " if i leave ,
[767/1000]	as soon as i reached the kitchen , i was greeted with a stack of my aunt and uncle 's luggage that i had never seen before . the table in the middle was covered in a dozen paper napkins
[768/1000]	" what will the police have to say ? " she sighed . " it 'll be fine . " it would n't . they 'd be sure of it . as if the thought of what a
[769/1000]	" you 've come back , " he murmured , moving closer . and then another warm body pressed against hers and he found himself moving the hair from her face . but her arms tightened around his
[770/1000]	there was an explosion nearby as the gun discharged . his fingers closed on the trigger , and he started to drag the fallen weapon back through the tunnel . i leapt forward , cutting him off at the
[771/1000]	but that was a whole other ball game . " now i 'm glad i stayed away from him in this whole weird war , " i laughed lightly . " wow , is there a reason we
[772/1000]	" damn , " he muttered . " what ? " " you 've got no clothes on , " he grumbled again . " how can you talk to me like that ? " " i
[773/1000]	but the pain was coming anyway because the agony was there , and i found i was choking , and i understood it well enough that on the other end of the pain , the agony was getting worse and
[774/1000]	' so , do you want to dance just for me or do you want me to start dancing with other ladies ? ' i ask , trying to lighten the atmosphere for him . he 's already turned to
[775/1000]	" i had a date . i do n't know where they are . " that feeling that someone had been spying on her made her cringe . " i 'm so sorry , " said rachel softly and
[776/1000]	" come be with you , " he coaxed softly . " be like everyone else i 've known . " as her gaze drifted to the tattoo he 'd told her of , her mind could only focus
[777/1000]	there was another pause . peter looked at the white tiles . he was ready to say something . " it has , " he said finally . he sat down and held out his hand .
[778/1000]	" so , " the man finally said . he looked at me and cocked his head slightly , " you remember , do n't you , " the man smiled and nodded . " i think even the most
[779/1000]	" well , fuck , " dalton said . " where else would there be ? " ian returned . ian turned to face him . " we do n't know that i tried to get her to

[782/1000]	he came forward and knelt to place his hand on my shoulder . i drew in my breath at the touch . with every touch , the need to make my sister and to avenge her and the victims of
[783/1000]	" yeah . " she nodded , then closed her eyes and inhaled . " it 's like the scent of the earth through my senses . i feel it . " " you are a vampire . do

[786/1000]	" so , she wants me to go with her . " i bit my lip . " i 'm not going to be a part of it , as much as i desire to . " " because
[787/1000]	a black - uniformed security guard rushed to her side . his mouth opened in an o of surprise . " miss ? " " yes . just a second . " she hurried out of the office ,
[788/1000]	he stood and turned , coming into the kitchen to check on her . " i 've never seen you like that . " she stood up again , shaking her head . " i 've been kind of
[789/1000]	he closed his eyes . she 'd seen the damage to the world he 'd made a promise to build after his name . he had n't let her walk away . he had n't fought her . he 'd
[790/1000]	" i came as fast as i could , " said jake . " i left a message for you on my cell phone in case you came home . i just wanted to thank you once more for the

[793/1000]	" i do n't see why they 're upset , " jamie said . " this way . " they could see a window on the left of the room there , and they saw a light on there
[794/1000]	" what was that ? " emma prompted . i sat up , not sure who was more irritated with me ; me or her . " you know , " emma began . " i mean someone in
[795/1000]	" did i make you nervous ? " his hands are hot against my back , kneading at my skin as my fingers play over his t - shirt . " you make me always nervous , " i
[796/1000]	" but i thought i told you you were n't going to leave it , " i ask . calder looks away for a moment , his jaw clenched . " i really am sorry , " he
[797/1000]	" we do n't have to have sex . the deal was with the two of us . that 's it . if we do n't , she 'll never talk to us again . " it was a
[798/1000]	" i 'm not going to let anyone hurt you , " he said huskily . " you have no idea what kind of evil they can be . " " i ca n't . " she clung to
[799/1000]	" you 've been so kind watching me , " she said . " it 's been fun . " " is it because you 're cute with that hair ? " i said . " mmm -
[800/1000]	" do n't worry . i promise to behave . i just ca n't believe you 'd do that . " " i know , i told you . " " will that make it okay ? "
[801/1000]	or maybe i can get you to stay , like he 's expecting . which is stupid since he was just as desperate for me to come back as i was for him . what a stupid fantasy .
[802/1000]	" how 's that ? " " i have a suggestion . " " it 's a good idea . " " look , if you plan on staying with me , i 'd appreciate some help
[803/1000]	" i ca n't take it anymore , " alex said , feeling angry even though he was n't . kara came up behind him and put her hand on his shoulder . the touch of her body had

[809/1000]	he opened the truck 's passenger door and got in on a side seat . i stayed where i was as he put something in the glove compartment . i listened harder , wondering what his sudden shift in mood
[810/1000]	by the time we finally make it to the parking garage , i 'm exhausted . the parking deck is vacant and pretty empty because it 's time to go to sleep . i close my eyes hoping for

[813/1000]	" can you afford some cheap wine ? " asked maggie . she sipped her cognac , watching him closely . " yes . i 've been saving money to buy it in an investment party i 'm hosting
[814/1000]	" not quite . why do n't we forget about the rest of our business tomorrow and just relax ? " " i am not relaxing . " she looked determined to resist . " uh ... "

[818/1000]	michael took her arm and led her into the foyer , both men watching behind to make sure there was not an obvious threat . " stay close to me for once , " michael said , " and
[819/1000]	" we need to stick to what we know and what we think . you found the disk , ms. so lando , and you found me before you got lost in the black hole . and the disk got

[824/1000]	" well look what it has gotten us . " a moment later they entered the foyer and the guards immediately started shooting into the door . " you fuckers are taking full advantage of my hospitality .
[825/1000]	i looked up at the sky , the moon so bright it was hard to see a single star . " thank you . " " for what ? " " saving me from drowning . for not
[826/1000]	" i do n't go in . it looks like it 's full of something , but i 'm pretty sure it 's only three or four kids . " " come with me , " he said ,
[827/1000]	" and thank you for the meal . i had no idea the last half of it would cost us . i would have been out late , had i known . " he smiled at me . he

[834/1000]	" no one came . " he still had n't looked up . " i thought about that , but i did n't know what to say . " " i believe you . " his shoulders relaxed
[835/1000]	all this brought him here to the room where the three of us were . i swallowed hard as i remembered why we 'd come here . it was n't to talk , this need and need that gripped
[836/1000]	" who did that thing with her ? " " who ? " " miss mc qu ade ? " " what about it ? " " did you see her ? " " did
[837/1000]	it was nearly thirty . she was seated on a bench across the street from a grocery store . not long after arriving , she 'd already bought coffee , bread , peanut butter and a loaf of fresh
[838/1000]	" yes , please , " he said . she took all the time she needed to get ready and get ready for work . for the first few minutes she was on guard , never letting her guard

[849/1000]	my mother was out there somewhere , and i was scared . the only clue to her whereabouts was that my boyfriend was n't out with two girls . what if their conversation was n't as innocuous as they seemed

[851/1000]	what he sees is this : a lone girl running like she 's a spr inter away from the goal lines , running through a crowd of teenagers . she does n't even glance at anyone , and looks right
[852/1000]	what the hell does that mean ? " we 've known each other for over twenty - five years and that 's a lot for a man to learn . i 'm surprised you 'd trust me that quickly after
[853/1000]	" thanks for the invite , mr. white , but it was n't to be . i 'm interested in hearing about a book called the human life and the human evolution . " " well , i do

[857/1000]	" uh ... , " i stammered , suddenly not sure what to say next , like , yeah it had been embarrassing to have said it and just because . what if i 'd thought we 'd be hooking
[858/1000]	" the next one 's a little trick ier . it 's a two - syllable question . there 's no question i need to pick the right question . ask the right questions . just pick one . "
[859/1000]	it was nothing , he 'd said , and he 'd hung up . the only thing that seemed to have bothered him was that he had n't answered his voicemail . her phone had been in the kitchen ,
[860/1000]	" i always thought you were . " " i 'm proud of my talent , and one day i 'll have a chance to prove it to you . " he did have an ulterior motive ,
[861/1000]	i looked over at him . " hey you ca n't tell anybody - " he waved one hand and crossed his arms . " - just about anything . " he was n't about to spill about
[862/1000]	oh no , that was n't right . she could n't get him out of her mind so quickly now that she 'd had chance to see him . not that she was giving him any chance of getting her
[863/1000]	" yeah , i 've had plans . but if you need a ride home tonight , someone must be driving you , " i told her , grabbing her hand . * * * i let her

[868/1000]	i nod , happy with his answer . this will make this perfect day perfect while i 'm away . he pulls out the white board and starts playing a tune . i move over to the chair he

[873/1000]	" the question is : can we trust him ? " his eyes darted away and another moment passed before he spoke . " hell of a question . i do n't know . " " you met
[874/1000]	" yeah , i did n't have anything to share with him after what he did to me , you know , the things he did to me , at least not now . i would n't be putting anything
[875/1000]	you ca n't know that , seth said . when i walked up to him , he knew just how much i 'm really counting on my feet right ' how much do you want ? kendra asked .
[876/1000]	' your boyfriend , is it ? ' ' yeah , and i 'd better be ready to get up and leave in about three , because we have a bus coming in a quarter hour . '

[878/1000]	" all of you . " his voice came out as a single , heavy sob . " i need you so much right now . just you . " he held her , their noses and lips touching
[879/1000]	" i made it into my own damn world and you two used it to screw in the end . here on the island , we have to separate . are you listening ? " " he did n't
[880/1000]	" just how many people know i 'm lying in my bed naked ? " he shifted his weight to one side and i could see the hint of a smile on his face . " as many as
[881/1000]	i rolled my eyes and then held that silly pout of mine up to my face . i did n't get why he could n't see through it and tell the truth . did anyone really need to know the
[882/1000]	" how 's the headache ? " he asked . " not good , but it will pass in a day or so . " " good . " he took her hand back , her fingers cold

[889/1000]	" he was a slave . he did n't survive the slave uprising . yet . " and he knew it instantly . the warlord had had no qualms about ensla ving and killing the most wealthy and powerful men
[890/1000]	" i wo n't see , " i said . " promise . if you tell anyone , i 'd hate to hear the rest of it . " he laughed in spite of himself . " okay
[891/1000]	i was confused . " sorry , but you probably have no idea how to get home and get there and do n't know if you should . just use the common transportation method your friends have taught you
[892/1000]	" yes ! do you have a gun ? " " yes i do " , he took the pistol and made sure he kept the revolver sharp . " do you have a flashlight ? " she
[893/1000]	" so this is the one girl , " said ripred . " this is the one , " said gregor . " well , i guess that makes everyone a lucky rat , " said ripred .

[902/1000]	" it 's fine , " i say , feeling defeated by the whole situation . " i was just having a conversation . " " with who ? " looking down , i tell him about what
[903/1000]	he smiled . " i understand that , and i 'll give the money back . but you had a contract . " " to make myself available to them . " " the people you bring to
[904/1000]	i could n't look at him . instead i dug deeper into my bag and dug for my phone . " i left yours inside , " i said , then shrugged . he walked back out and out
[905/1000]	" i 'm assuming you 've also checked up on his status due to us having lost him . he has n't spoken to me since i announced his promotion . " " i have n't done anything .
[906/1000]	" i have a lot of work to do . " he stepped in close and put his hands on her cheeks . " do n't tell me to shut up , mrs. madison . you are n't thinking
[907/1000]	<EOS> said , " yes . " <EOS> said , " you said you ca n't take to the movies , " she said , " have you got another crisis . " she said , " what kind
[908/1000]	i opened the cupboard and saw a bottle of wine . i shrugged before pulling it out . " are you going to drink that ? " asked katie . " no . it 's important , and
[909/1000]	the big brother nods when he hears , but keeps my mom out of my line of vision . i step back to the front of the store . " where did you learn to cook like that ?
[910/1000]	" you okay ? " she nodded and smiled , " yeah . it 's just a bit of jet lag . " they were heading toward a small mall on the outskirts of denver when she spoke
[911/1000]	" that would be me , " he said . " how did you do that ? " i asked , " it 's just not possible . " " it 's not , " he said .
[912/1000]	" well it does n't matter . it does n't help , anyway . " " i got it already . just put it down , will you ? i have it down . here it is , ok
[913/1000]	" the way i see it , it 's only right that he does . " " you 've known this guy your entire life , and as far as i know , you 've never been able to
[914/1000]	" did you hear that back there ? " he says , nodding towards the front door . " all that yelling . she does n't like it , " he says as a joke , but i know he
[915/1000]	" the truth is the truth , my little kitten . this was the last thing he went on before he died . " she looked down at the bed . " and he had not died because of what
[916/1000]	" and a pretty big one , as well , " said ben , the words like metal pushing through his windpipe . " if you come running to get to her , " said ben , " she
[917/1000]	" but she was never the most agreeable woman , i might add . no gentleman could have enjoyed a woman the way i did her , " he admitted haltingly . " a man of her looks can easily
[918/1000]	" get her the fuck out of my room ! " i yell as fast as i can , not caring that i probably wake up my mom in the other room . i am scared she 'll call the
[919/1000]	i could hear my aunt walking down the hall , so i sat on my towel and pretended to play fish . " does that mean you do n't want to fight anymore ? " she called down from
[920/1000]	" yes ! " she cried , almost shouting the truth . " but ... you 're supposed to be dead , " i growled . " i know . " she cried harder . a blast
[921/1000]	" there 's no point , " sam said tiredly , as though she 'd accomplished a lot in the short time since they 'd arrived . " i ca n't find anyone . not back at the house .
[922/1000]	" but the truth is . it looks like if i 'm too arrogant and over confident right away , he 'll stop the fight and i can tell by the look of shock on his face - i ca
[923/1000]	" i never wanted anyone to know what bad luck that was like . this was my punishment for it ! i promised i would never call myself a whore , but it 's hard to keep a promise to
[924/1000]	" i 'm going to call my doctor , " she said , pushing herself up to the edge of the pool , even though her head was screaming for her to rest . " but ... i'm not sure
[925/1000]	i am running out of time . i grab the phone from mom 's hand from across the kitchen , dial the number , and then hurl the phone . it smashes against an unlit fireplace . i start
[926/1000]	' but the end of the world .... ' elena had no way of explaining the implications of this latest news . ' we shall have to be ready , then . ' ' for it ? '
[927/1000]	" no . thank god for that . why the hell do i want to see him anyway ? " but his concern is written all over his face . " you get to see him if you want
[928/1000]	the door opens wider and a tall , bearded man enters and closes the door . he turns to the crowd and then to both of us . after a pause , he looks at each one of us and
[929/1000]	" i will , " he said . " when we catch the wolf , we will find out whether his will is binding or if it 's something different and more binding than a human 's will . "
[930/1000]	" <EOS> " . " " what ? " i replied , turning bright smiles to my roommate . our friendship made it difficult to get to know her better <EOS> - he loved her and only her .
[931/1000]	i reached out slowly and cupped his face in my hand . his lips pressed to mine , the kiss quick and frantic . then he released me . " just tell us where we are going , "
[932/1000]	the crowd laughed a lot more this time though and he walked the group and made them go to the bar , which was situated in the same corner of the theater as the movie . they were drinking
[933/1000]	he nodded . " at one time it was a woman who was making a family . " " your father . " she nodded . " then i met a woman . " he
[934/1000]	his hands were empty of food , or else he carried the remains of the loaf . " you should take care of the stew first . then come down to the dining hall as soon as you 're done
[935/1000]	" we 're not in the middle of a battle , " she answered . " we 're just on our way to see what the first demon has to offer , " she replied , pointing to jai who
[936/1000]	" i would n't let anything happen to it , " i said as we reached the front door . " you do n't still have the keys ? " " i 'm afraid not , " i
[937/1000]	" it is , " she said , after a minute 's consideration . the man 's lips thinned to a line . " your father 's your uncle , i take it . " in all
[938/1000]	in the middle of the night , she woke sore , dehydrated and needing some water . she crept the bed further to the window and stared down at the grass between the trees . she could n't help
[939/1000]	" good , good . " he put out the fire and lit . i poured him another beer while he looked around for another one . " thanks , " i said . " i 'll be right
[940/1000]	" if you want to move back , i can drive by each house we go to for you . " " i 'd like that very much . but i 've already been moving on . i 'd
[941/1000]	i nodded , and smiled , and got out . i 'd already picked up a towel from the side gate . i covered my shoulder with it and stepped into the pool of water . i rinsed out my
[942/1000]	" maybe not , " she whispered . after that , we stood there awkwardly , feeling awkward for what seemed like hours . it was only a few minutes later when she nodded toward the corner where i
[943/1000]	' no , ' ben said softly . the house was small . it was the sort of house where the young and the powerful must often see , even read about , the man they had named as
[944/1000]	she tried to protest , but at this point she was n't sure if she wanted to be treated as a child at one of these places . " if i tell the truth - " he said "
[945/1000]	his head tilted and his gaze flickered from her face to her chest . " what 's your wound ? " " it 's nothing , " olivia said , and realized she did n't feel like telling him
[946/1000]	the man in black turned and leaned against the bar while he waited for instructions . the stranger was holding a cigar in his mouth . " what ? " he shook his head and lit the cigar .
[947/1000]	" the president finally sent the other staff , in this case , into oblivion , " she replied sadly . " she 's tough , " i commented . " everyone was once , " she responded
[948/1000]	" i was tired , " i tell alex as we pull to a stop on the main road a short time later . " i do n't want to go back to the car . " his lips
[949/1000]	" to work the next day , " she mumbled , running a wet finger over the tiny tear with the barest of touches . " there 's another big day coming . " after a few seconds ,
[950/1000]	the red - haired nurse , an attractive one , appeared almost instantly next to her . " do n't worry they 're just keeping them sedated for a while to get them accli mated to our medication . i
[951/1000]	i made my way to the bathroom , ignoring his call to let him know where i was going . i changed into my clothes and walked into the kitchen : breakfast - my favorite choice of porridge . it
[952/1000]	" what was wrong with the doctor ? the nurse could have gone and hurt herself or someone else , " he growled , his eyes lighting up as if he was hoping to alleviate my concern . "
[953/1000]	" for all your energy in the day , there has never been a more capable person than you , " he whispered , moving his mouth to hers , slowly , as if savoring her . it was
[954/1000]	" so , the two days of my first deployment are going to be one ? " " i saw the results online , and i would n't be surprised if you 've got plenty of time and a
[955/1000]	just before he left town early , he walked up into the small motel room where his family lived . the place smelled of warm , clean pine . he walked over and opened the bedroom door . it was
[956/1000]	" very good , your grace , " i said . i had brought the largest body of water i had brought with me . at the foot of my bed was a large bathtub filled with white marble
[957/1000]	" no . " i took another step toward him . i had n't realized my arms were crossed over my chest like that until i saw the look on his face change . i do n't know if
[958/1000]	" how 'd you manage to get the key and my cell phone , " she asked , trying to keep the tone light and teasing . " i took them from my old man and i figured we
[959/1000]	" no . i have n't been to california to visit you and you never told me they brought you here . " she shrugged . " you do n't strike me as a california girl . "
[960/1000]	" you 're a good boy , " i said . " i know you 're your father 's son . but you have to trust my judgment in this one last thing . if you do n't , the
[961/1000]	" just because i 've been a part of this town with those few who 've lived here for over forty years does not mean i 'm a monster . " " what happened here ? " "
[962/1000]	" this is important , " he reminded me fiercely . " you ca n't keep using your name like that . this is a serious matter . " i nodded in agreement . having a job has this
[963/1000]	" my name is brian . i work at the office and i 'm going to run into them for a few minutes . " " sure thing , " sean said , dropping his bag on the floor
[964/1000]	what a gorgeous man , she thought . his kiss was long , wet and hungry . there were no barriers and no room for doubt . he kissed her with a sensuality that promised of power and dominance
[965/1000]	" there are always women willing to do anything to please me , " he says , giving me a slow , probing lick . god , he 's sexy . his body is perfect , too . "
[966/1000]	' what did he say ? ' ' say what ? ' ' as well as he might . he was here in the morning . at the gates , and he was looking after your garden and
[967/1000]	" i 've never wanted to be any of those things . " and she felt a stirring inside , a strange mixture of warmth and longing that she could n't entirely grasp . " i 'm not
[968/1000]	" i had heard they did n't have anything to lose , and i knew that once we started getting our hands on something , they would see real , live , and we would know exactly what we needed
[969/1000]	because i was getting more and more tired of having to eat the bullshit . i needed something more human than this strange , pale - skinned creature who wanted to kill me . " i guess i can
[970/1000]	" that must be the little female . " i smile as i put the picture of eden in his room . but the image fades as soon as i touch it . " it 's possible . "
[971/1000]	he was right , of course . when you lived in a city like this , and then you had a pretty girl who 'd brought you and your clothes and weapons ... but they could n't do any
[972/1000]	' ah , mrs harper , ' mr nicholls said cheerfully . ' mr nicholls says i need to go back to work . ' she flicked her eyes to the road , her face pale . '
[973/1000]	" now that 's just pathetic . " " so if you see anything , make sure to go to the bathroom first , okay ? " they drove the rest of the way in silence , just
[974/1000]	" what do you mean ? " he said , holding her hand . " just tell me . i ca n't take this anymore . i 'm so damn exhausted . " * * * jack
[975/1000]	he sat there for a long moment in the dark , listening to how slow the wind had become , still whistling through the branches , then sat up . he walked to the edge of the road and looked
[976/1000]	" you 're sick , william , " julia said , taking a step forward and poking him in his chest . she planted her hands on her h * ps and glared at him . he gave her
[977/1000]	he stopped dead in the doorway . chapter 13 there were several people in the suite . one of them was a woman and she recognized the lady she was with . she had not seen this lady
[978/1000]	" i have a secret handshake with your boss himself ! " she blinked in amazement ; her hand on her mouth . what did he say ? did he actually tell her what to do ? she could
[979/1000]	i could give a f * * k if i was in the wrong neighborhood , so i walked to the corner , walking swiftly and praying no one was watching . i still was n't sure if it was
[980/1000]	" so - " she began , but then stopped , her face losing all color as she realized what was in front of her . whatever it was , it was not good . " mother , what
[981/1000]	" no , " i said . " i could find you one of them . " " i do n't need your kind , " he muttered , in a voice far lower than it should have been
[982/1000]	" he helped me get away from the law , " a stranger said , coming out of a doorway . he wore a dark raincoat , probably his work . " and since you 'll be in no hurry
[983/1000]	" i will see that it does . " he started to open his door , then stopped , looking sideways at her . " when you are ready , i will take you . i will stay when you
[984/1000]	the lights are on in the office , and the place is not quite empty . i have my assistant go in and get a few dirty martinis . " what have you taken ? " i ask as
[985/1000]	" that is the true purpose of the black coffin . " " then what does this mean ? " " it means that you are a hero . a real hero . you will save innocent people
[986/1000]	" is there any way you could talk to your other siblings about it ? " " no . i want to be alone . " " i understand . we 'll get rid of him , okay
[987/1000]	but do i really want to be with him when he 's going to be gone forever ? " no , " i lie , looking everywhere but at him . there 's a knock at the door
[988/1000]	" i 'll talk to her , " he said , and he handed the book his jacket . " come on , let 's go . " he led her to the edge of the roof , stepped across
[989/1000]	why did he do it ? <EOS> it 's obvious that the question bothered him . the answer is : because i needed to . " is that right ? " i asked . " i do n't
[990/1000]	" do you suppose my father had anything to do with this ? " he asked . the inspector shrugged , looked to the wall to his right . " i did n't see much of this room after
[991/1000]	" they do that when they 're about to do something very smart . " she smiles . " let 's get you out of here . " " okay , i could use a shower . "
[992/1000]	" ah , yes , " said my assistant . " it 's your office . follow me , please , " he said , backing away a step . i wanted to protest or tell him to stop coming
[993/1000]	tom and tom saw each other again , " do you have any idea what a fool you really are ? " tom shrugged his shoulders . " i do n't know what you mean " tom
[994/1000]	it was n't until he arrived at the house , back from his search of the night , that he became aware that he was cold and the first thing he noticed was that the windows were covered with paper
[995/1000]	" hey ! do n't be like that , " he said . he pointed to me . " this is a perfectly good present . " " you like it ? " i asked him . "
[996/1000]	emma 's eyes flickered to his and back again . in a tight voice , he replied : ' no , not so hard . ' ' really , there 's no need . ' she was trembling
[997/1000]	" that 's your girl , is n't she ? " " yep , " answered the man , and he smiled broadly , his gray stubble glistening in the early morning golden light . " she ca
[998/1000]	he ran his hand down her nose without lifting his head . " do n't be here , angel . i do n't want you . i never want to love another woman . " " i 'm not
[999/1000]	" okay . " i sit on the couch and check the house , hoping to catch a glimpse of him , but he 's gone . i sit down on the floor , and stare at the
