[2/1000]	" i 've been to one . i 've gotten so used to it , and it 's nice to be seen without being out there . it 's a nice place to be in the sun all the time
[3/1000]	i grabbed my phone , and my pulse sped up in anticipation . since it was the last time i 'd call her , i texted back , tell your mom i wo n't be home for a month .
[4/1000]	" you must understand , i do n't feel i should give up my mother when she 's dying , " said charles . as long as charles understood , what took him weeks to comprehend was that his
[5/1000]	chapter forty the next morning , peter sat in the kitchen picking up the newspaper when her knock sounded on the front door . he set it aside and walked to the door to open it for her .
[6/1000]	" i also had to find someone else 's job to take it , " he says sadly . " or at least to get rid of it . and i 've never had a better time in my life
[7/1000]	" like i had much to offer ? " " i see how you look at her . i saw how close you tried to avoid her , it was all your fault , " he chuckled , then
[8/1000]	" i am sure , " the lady said , " that the matter is not out of the realm of dispute and a matter must be put to some logical argument . " " some , " lenk
[9/1000]	" i 've got one thing on you , " he said . " no biting until i put a stop to this and let you talk . " " i 'm scared , " she said , and
[10/1000]	" i understand . " she nodded . " it was my own decision to stay . i do n't know about you ... " " it 's fine . i understand . " she reached for my
[11/1000]	he opened his mouth , but my mouth closed over the sound . instead of trying to find the right words , i cupped his face between my hands and pressed a kiss into the cold skin below his jaw
[12/1000]	i closed my eyes briefly . the heat of the water and even the steam of the shower helped to soothe me . i began to drift and i thought of noah 's words about time being different than how
[13/1000]	the thing with jason walker was i did n't know how i felt about it . on the one hand , i knew i was n't like some of the others who had his way with women . on the
[14/1000]	as he waited , he felt his blood begin to boil , and he remembered vividly the incident with his brother . it was when the master had met him at the river . this time there had been

[16/1000]	for her part , she did not have a better answer . her brain , however , had other ideas . there was not a thing she could do about ryan 's reaction , which would not have been justified
[17/1000]	my mother appeared , followed by william . " why all the fuss ? " she asked . " we 're trying to get you out of here , mary ellen , " william said . " mary
[18/1000]	" what are you trying to say ? " " i 'm trying to do what i should have done in a moment of weakness ... " she began in a weak , in articulate , pleading voice .
[19/1000]	a high - pitched , frightened voice came sharply from behind him . " mr. holden ! what are you doing here ? get away ! go . " the woman was tall , slim , and slender with
[20/1000]	" in what way ? " he wanted to know . " you see , i love you . i do . your family has been great since our marriage . i have no obligations so i could go
[21/1000]	and that 's it . i 'd taken another chance . at least now , if i could n't go through with having a child , at least she would know in her heart that she was a lucky girl
[22/1000]	" they did n't have any time to stop for a fire . our place is completely surrounded by forest . i do n't see the road . " " our house is right outside of town , i
[23/1000]	this idea appeals to me . and why should n't i ? why is no one curious about me ? for years my world has been a mixture of a book and people . there 's just me and
[24/1000]	" do you have a number about this ? " matt asked . " yes , why ? " " ask sarah to call you back . " " what will happen if she does n't ?
[25/1000]	" we 've got to get him to take a leak , " john said , " or else he 'll start cursing outside and we 'll both wind up dead . " " why do n't we wait
[26/1000]	he took a few steps and i walked with him , like a couple of puppies who did n't want anyone else coming between them . " the guy you saved from the wolves is there . "
[27/1000]	" well - there is , so it might be worth it , at least . " but at that , he turned abruptly and walked away , muttering something that sounded like " i 'll bet he had
[28/1000]	" what 's the catch ? " " i have to make you something to wear tonight . i ... well , there 's no really my style , actually . " " you 'd say something like
[29/1000]	he turned to richard . " and that i think you and richard ought to go back to your camp , if you feel like it . you 've come all this way to return to a world that is

[31/1000]	what was she going to be when the time came ? what were her intentions in doing his bidding ? if either of them were going to succeed , she had to make sure she could stop by the
[32/1000]	the doctor smiled , his smile becoming more like a grim mask . " and this is what happened ? i was asleep ? " " well ... yes . " he took the small clipboard from her ,
[33/1000]	he sat back and crossed his legs , letting his arms hang down over the knee of his jeans . she had a feeling she was going to have to ask the question that no other woman ever had
[34/1000]	" i love you . i 'll do everything i can to protect you . " " you 've done the right thing . just know that if you do n't keep a low profile this time , that
[35/1000]	" as long as you be with me . " the fact he would have such a strong reaction to their relationship was more than a little thrilling . his happiness was n't on her mind , but the fact
[36/1000]	" his eyes show pain . " i shook his hand and he turned , moving to me . it was like watching a stranger look at a stranger , and suddenly , i wanted to hug him .
[37/1000]	where did i take my cell ? it was tucked into my back pocket where i 'd have the extra space . i had to grab it quickly because i did n't want my hands or tongue touching anything .
[38/1000]	" well , if you 're looking for a hot date to get rid of the itch , i doubt i could be persuaded after fifteen minutes on the outside you 're not the finest specimen on the street .
[39/1000]	the sun had just returned when they finally emerged from a rocky hill and began to descend into the valley below . it was a magnificent sight . the grass was green and the sky was clear , although it
[40/1000]	the door burst open again a few seconds later , the guard who was working for sam , looking like he 'd been punched in the face . " sam ? what 's happening ? " he rushed forward
[41/1000]	" and what did you do , pray up to twenty years . " " we were playing house , i guess . " " you 're up there in chicago ? it sounds like you 're a
[42/1000]	" only by putting them in our stomachs . let 's go make the breakfast , shall we ? " i say . the boys leap to their feet and follow me out of the room , and i
[43/1000]	his eyes narrowed a bit as he held the phone to his ear . " we 'll do what we can . " he held up a finger to his driver . " and do n't even get killed tonight
[44/1000]	" just have fun , " he said . " what are you going to do at your concert ? " as the question crossed his lips , the limo suddenly had a slight lull in the traffic
[45/1000]	" me at all and all , " he agreed . " you 're gon na have to stay with me . " " i 'm not ! " " you 're gon na be your own maid
[46/1000]	" i thought you said you were going to get more answers from someone who 's known you in years ? " " i am , " i replied , more serious this time . " but i 'll
[47/1000]	i was n't sure about the part where he and my sisters were doing something illegal to make sure our little town did n't fall apart . jake was the opposite ; confident in his knowledge of the business
[48/1000]	" oh , " she said , and began to cry a little in silent sympathy . " i was n't sure you 'd want to come along . " i thought if it were n't for her , i
[49/1000]	" i can change . " he put a hand on the side of her neck and pushed her away . but when she took a step forward , his grip on her loosened and then loosened again .
[50/1000]	" i 'll go to the house right now , " he said , taking off his jacket . " how much is the press going to say to you afterwards ? " she shrugged . " about why
[51/1000]	" you mean the guy is n't dead ? " i asked . " he 's not . but the girl is . " " what happened ? how long ago was that ? " " about
[52/1000]	she has been in an extremely bad mood , possibly from the loss of the food . her breathing is fast , but her eyes are steady on me . i wait for her to take advantage and tell me
[53/1000]	ian 's thoughts were in turmoil as he attempted to decide . what if he told his dad he 'd have the money to pay for the lawyer ? this would never work , and he was n't sure he
[54/1000]	" i can feel the sweat . it 's like it can smell my body right now . " he reached up and ran his fingers through my hair and kissed me softly on the forehead . " even in
[55/1000]	" as you wish . " but instead , he headed off with a smile on his face , the first indication he was even considering that i had ever asked him to . " i 'm going to help
[56/1000]	i pulled up before the gym . the gates were closed , so i pulled in a deep breath and climbed out . i turned my brain off and ran toward the gym . by the time my pace slowed
[57/1000]	' no you do n't . i want to talk to you and i 'm going to do it . ' she frowned . ' okay . what 's down there ? ' he 'd thought about that
[58/1000]	" damn , " he groaned . " i 've missed you . i 've needed you at least five minutes . " with great reluctance raine stepped away from the doorjamb and faced him . even with the
[59/1000]	" you and me , little girl ? " he said with a wry grin , just before the elevator doors closed . " i 'm not sure ... you and i , you 've never really ... "
[60/1000]	i got out of the car fast , opened the door and stepped out into the warm summer air . my stomach grumbled . if i was n't prepared for the smell of bacon , my stomach would go straight
[61/1000]	' it 's true , ' i said . ' what i said was a lie . i will admit my love for you is purely platonic . i just do n't enjoy spending as much time with the family
[62/1000]	mike nodded slowly . " maybe mike does n't know what 's going on around him . " i sat up and laughed . " i would n't have put it that way . " " how do
[63/1000]	jack if this is real , then there 's no end to it , is there ? jack i tell you the truth . i hate these dreams ... i really hate them . he pauses
[64/1000]	" i 'm afraid not , " she said . " i mean , you 've already had lunch with me . " " yes i have . " " why ? " " i 'm
[65/1000]	" there 's only two people to kill . " chapter 26 as a student in the new physics class , i learned that the science of physics is the opposite of the science of physics . being
[66/1000]	" yes , why ? what 's wrong ? " sam and ruth exchanged knowing glances . " the hospital was attacked , " said ruth . " attacked ? how ? " " in the
[67/1000]	the lights dimmed . " one moment , " she said , " i need to show you your new home . " she took him to a corner , but never asked . " this is the last
[68/1000]	" i 'll take the picture , " she called out . there was no response . " come on , " spencer called out again . she did n't want to just sit around and wait .
[69/1000]	as for the other , we did the same . " not sure how many of them there were , " said wanda . " a bunch . " " what 's wrong with them ? "
[70/1000]	" she was supposed to be with a friend ... but apparently she got a call from her older sister at her house while she was getting the call . " " i ca n't believe this , "
[71/1000]	" i suppose your father is n't going to like being in court today ? " i knew , which was why i was glad he was going to have to go . he had that same expression the
[72/1000]	you 're going to be okay . i got some things to say , but i 've always planned and built my future for myself . i expect you to take that for granted . the love you 've
[73/1000]	" who knows ? let it be a mystery , and we will finally determine the truth . " " let 's assume we do n't find anything . and then what ? " " then the future
[74/1000]	they stood outside the church . " why were you on the back of my bike , my lord and savior ? " she asked nervously . " my word , i do n't even have to ask
[75/1000]	" your last name is bradley , not bradley . " oh , i found it . i had one last name . " yeah ? " the doctor went by the sink and looked in the
[76/1000]	' ah , ' said the troll . ' i thought you said you knew the rules . ' the word ' laws ' was writ across the trolls ' eyes . the sentence and it are not to be
[77/1000]	" your family has a lot of support . " " you always did have a bunch of big egos , " she says , and i 'm speechless . but then she leans forward and asks , "
[78/1000]	my brow furrowed . i wanted to ask the question that i had been worried about the entire time , but found myself speechless . " you want to meet up outside my place ? " he asked ,
[79/1000]	" not yet , " she said . the word seemed like a secret word but with such a weighty meaning that it was difficult to keep secrets . or , he tried to tell himself , they would n't
[80/1000]	she smiled at him before turning her gaze to the young men . " thank you . for all your help . you will treasure those with your lives . i will treasure them as many as they give me
[81/1000]	' i can . you 're very well on your way , ma'am , ' he said again . ' all four of you , quick ! ' the soldier in blue 's coat darted through the doorway
[82/1000]	" i 'd like to stay with you , " she murmured . " but if we ca n't share a bed tonight i 'm going to go up a little later . " as he gave her a
[83/1000]	" what do you want , " she asked him . " to show you . " " show me what ? " he pushed off the counter and grabbed her wrist . " here . "
[84/1000]	my eyes flash to his . they 're no longer happy , now they 're mocking . he has a death wish . " you 're a masochi st , are n't you ? " i step forward , feeling
[85/1000]	the woman lowered the weapon . her green eyes danced with amusement - amusement he would n't have thought possible . it was a side of her he did n't recognize . " i 'm sorry , " the
[86/1000]	" hey , you guys are here , were n't you ? this is so cool , " i whispered shakily , unable to see through the glare of the flashlights as they walked up the road towards us .
[87/1000]	i stepped farther in . i saw the room was empty beyond his . " what 's the matter with you ? " i called . when a movement caught my eye , i pointed to the door behind him
[88/1000]	" it 's fine , " she said without looking up or even faltering her pace . his heart filled with such a relief that he was almost embarrassed that he was in awe of her . the only
[89/1000]	if anything did and it was all just that , then it was in his mind the right thing : the right thing , and it was true : god has taught him to do things simply because you have
[90/1000]	i glanced at my nightstand and then closed my eyes . sleep instantly claimed me . * * * " i wake up , " mom said . " i know . " i sounded desperate .
[91/1000]	the world was gray and barren . it would be an easy place to think . i felt that , too . it was coming to a stop just a minute or two away now , just inches from
[92/1000]	it took him little longer than an hour to get through the rest of the gate . in a great hurry , he came into el r ond 's office , where he sat drinking at a comfortable table ,
[93/1000]	" very good . i 'll see you soon . " that 's it . i 'm done with being a moron about this . " oh , that 's all fine . see you soon . "
[94/1000]	" i do understand why you feel that way . but maybe it 's time to be open with us . maybe we deserve to know . " " who were you protecting and who was that shooter ?
[95/1000]	" very , " he agreed , sounding surprised . " i must say i really enjoyed the first time we were together . i remember well every moment we spent together . we 'd go skiing , go for
[96/1000]	" that 's very generous of you , " i replied quickly , not wanting to give her the impression i was on her side . " but i 'm sure it would be better if they do n't .
[97/1000]	" but there will still be one more possibility - " her voice broke . the tears poured over her chin . " one more reason why <EOS> , when i look at you standing there with those bright eyes
[98/1000]	" we were going to , " he says calmly and then shakes his head . " ah , " i nod and sigh heavily . " you wanted to go to europe ? " " yes .
[99/1000]	" the way things look from here , all i have to do is follow his instructions from now on . " " i believe the same goes for you , " david said . " very well
[100/1000]	i nodded ; i needed it now more than ever after what happened earlier with tyler - like i were trying to protect her , but even if they were to help me stay alive , or if i needed
[101/1000]	" we 'll talk later , " he told her through gritted teeth , " if it makes you feel better . " it made her feel good . because she 'd never been afraid of anything before .
[102/1000]	" all right , " he decided , " i 'll tell you about it when you , ah , well , i ... " he ended his sentence in a low , rumbling " gods , " and
[103/1000]	she was so scared he would throw her out . " how 'bout you walk me through the whole process ? how about that ? " a woman came out of the shop with a basket of groceries
[104/1000]	" do n't . " he took a step closer . " are you threatening me ? " " i 'm not threatening you . " " then what ? why were you afraid of the rain ? "
[105/1000]	i shook my head in exasperation , though , and glanced at the clock on the big , open - topped desk , which said it was almost two in the morning . it was time for lunch time .
[106/1000]	" i ... i ... " a lie would have been better , but i could n't quite let her know that he was <EOS> just as surprised as i was . " you 're welcome ? " one
[107/1000]	her hands found the top of his trousers and found the waistband , jerking them down ... she lifted , swinging them into motion . and then they were on him , ripping off his jeans and underwear in
[108/1000]	" how much longer ? " i asked . " before we run out of gas ? " he smiled in a charming way . " we 'll have to keep on the road . we arrived in record
[109/1000]	" is it a real estate agent ? " " yes . " " why is she doing this ? " " i 'm not sure ... " " but you 've been through the business
[110/1000]	" you know our mother who was married to my stepfather ? " she asked , her voice even more soft because she had n't expected him to know her mother . the truth in her voice surprised him ,
[111/1000]	" you ca n't deny it , " one of the soldiers pointed out . " okay , listen . i 'm going to stop in ten minutes . i 'm not going to lie and say i 'm
[112/1000]	" and no . " " i understand , " i said , trying to hide my relief . " would you give me a bit of space ? " " that would be my pleasure , madam
[113/1000]	" but it 's possible to fix it , " i said , not liking where this conversation was going . " i 'd rather you fix the problem on your own . " she said , and i
[114/1000]	ethan frowned . she explained that the old man had been told to listen for someone or something , and like anyone , he wanted to get in the way . it was a pretty smart lie to tell
[115/1000]	" this morning , we had cereal . " he paused for a moment , " before she died . " " why could n't she hear me when i could hear her ? why did n't she come
[116/1000]	" yes . " " why did they bring you here ? " i opened my eyes . " for my parents . " i turned my head slightly to give ryder a piece of my mind .
[117/1000]	" it 's a lie . " " i ca n't believe this is true . " " it 's not . i was in the alley this afternoon , watched john . " he considered .
[118/1000]	a faint tingling sensation swept through grace so strongly that she was suddenly thrown back on a wave of pleasure , the release of the last vestiges of the awful orgasm . she let the flow go and for
[119/1000]	" i wish i could , honey . but i ca n't if you have your parents paying for it . " " i know i should , but i ca n't . " " you should ,
[120/1000]	he turned on her with a smile . " let 's swim . " " why ? " she came out of the bathroom with a damp washcloth pressed to her hand . " because i 'm exhausted
[121/1000]	" no . they 're too expensive , and it 's supposed to be a great day for tourists to get lost in town and have fun . i want to buy two tickets . " " you ca
[122/1000]	" that 's not my fault . " i sigh and take the empty glass in hand and drop it back on the side table . the music starts playing loudly this time and i lean my head against
[123/1000]	they found dr. a yers in his office , writing away . he was a nice man in an unpleasant sort of way , but would n't say too much . his wife had told him she 'd been murdered
[124/1000]	" he 's a very nice boy . " " thank you . yes , well , " i say casually , as if it 's no real matter what i did , " time for my visit to
[125/1000]	the room came to life around me . the sounds of people talking , glasses being refilled , the rush of water at the sink . " i almost miss it with my real life , " alex whispered
[126/1000]	" you are my boy , " he says , but when i take his hand , his knuckles turn white . his eyes lock on mine with such hope that i squeeze tighter . i squeeze back , and
[127/1000]	" look , i do n't know what happened with nick . he asked me out on friday night and i dropped nick off . " nick , huh ? " i 've got a date . "
[128/1000]	she turned it into a radio as i approached . but she did n't sit on the dashboard . she sat in a huge plastic tub , feet on two pedals , the seat tilted forward , the motor running
[129/1000]	" no , i 'm only a little nervous , actually . " i admit . " this is the first time i 've seen you up there . they say you 're an excellent sport . " he
[130/1000]	" are you in ? " my friend looked away on his way to the door . " yeah . i 'm here . " " we 're friends , then . " he gave me a
[131/1000]	she could n't think about it anymore . one thing that she could think about was her husband , and if she thought about that hard stuff , it made it feel even worse . she had two more days
[132/1000]	she sat on the edge of the bed and put her feet back into her sneakers . " i 'm not here to ruin the lovely evening . " his eyes moved over her still - bare legs ,
[133/1000]	i let those words linger in my mind and was amazed to understand that he would do it and the other boys would do it to me just like he did . he knows he can do it . he
[134/1000]	she moved forward to stand on the top stair . " i do n't remember where i saw those ... whatever they were . " " you will remember , " jack said . " i am sure that
[135/1000]	" i know this song makes me feel big when i 'm singing it , " i pointed out . " i hate little kids and i always give them a nickname . " " i 'm sure that
[136/1000]	" i have n't talked to my sister , " he adds , and i notice the fact that i 've been unable to catch his gaze all evening . " you never did tell me , " i
[137/1000]	" you know , " he said slowly . " you 're smarter than you look . " she jerked her head back . " not everything is about sex . " that earned him a cold
[138/1000]	he does n't . he stands there and stares at me . and oh god ... there is nothing i want more than to touch his face . i want to curl against him and let his strong arms
[139/1000]	" so is this another one of those jokes from the past ? " " no , you got me , man . this way i can drive straight back home tomorrow afternoon if you can pick me up
[140/1000]	she turned and took a look at me . " is there something wrong ? " " actually , " i said , putting a hand on her forearm , " he did n't leave . " i turned
[141/1000]	there were other options too . for example , the road back from my house was through a small gorge . it ended near a wooden bridge , which would be safe from the oncoming mob . and the fact
[142/1000]	" no , he 's already done his part . it 's finished . " " my apologies , " i said . i walked to the door . his arm locked around me . i heard him
[143/1000]	you ca n't run from who you want . that girl used to have a lot of power . i could have just kicked her to the curb like i did all those other girls . she was
[144/1000]	oh f * * k ! i did n't have time to think up another lie . i pushed away from the wall and took a step toward her , but she moved away from me . she did
[145/1000]	" okay , hold steady . i was about to ask . " " how long was this party for ? " i asked . " a couple of hours . " " well , is n't
[146/1000]	the last thing i would have expected to see from him was the man i 'd loved . i would n't have cared . i cared about every single thing about my new life . but this thing with hunter
[147/1000]	a few more minutes passed , and then the air was heavy with the smells of baked beans , mashed potatoes , rolls and buttered rolls . " that smells wonderful . " " i know . it
[148/1000]	" so ... what about this is for real ? " she sounded very hopeful , and i 'd never been one to question anything . " yes , you 're married - very young ; it sounds like
[149/1000]	his phone rings . " ugh . not you again . " he takes a deep breath and pulls his phone from his pocket . " hey , mama . " " hey sweetheart . i 'm on
[150/1000]	i looked through the glass at the place where i had started the day on a mission for my father . " have you ever been inside this place ? " i hesitated , not wanting to confess
[151/1000]	she did <EOS> in fact show up at the house . she parked her car and a man helped her out . that being said did not make my heart skip a beat . there were two guys with her
[152/1000]	i nodded . " uh , tell me about the other guys , " i said . he bit his lip and looked away . " i do n't think these guys are really good looking . "
[153/1000]	" did you see any blood , you 'd better be right . " " of course i did watch some blood , it 's not like there was anything that could not have been put away by a
[154/1000]	jake grinned . " i think that 's what you said eight years ago . " he held out his hand . " i was fourteen , " i reminded him . jake stroked my back . "
[155/1000]	" how did she die ? " " it 's complicated . " " i 'm not sure i understand either . " " she was ambushed or overpowered by the hunters . her life is over
[156/1000]	" you 're in danger , " ryan muttered . i could feel the blood draining from my face as i felt my brain slow to a sluggish pace . abby sat up and wrapped her legs around ryan
[157/1000]	" what is it ? " her father asked , placing a hand on her shoulder and giving it a gentle squeeze . " nothing . what do you want me to do ? " " i 'm
[158/1000]	" i gave you what you wanted ? " " yes . and if i did n't , that would n't matter . it all would n't matter , because you were making it so damn good for me
[159/1000]	" no , " he said softly . " no , but it 's something i ca n't explain . please do n't be upset that the only men who came to my office said i was a candidate for
[160/1000]	the thought made her mouth purse with displeasure . but she forced herself not to speak . what would happen if he tried to follow her now ? it would only be hurting him more . she knew that all
[161/1000]	" is he ... was he here ? how are you ? " a warm , dry smile appeared . " you do n't even need to ask . he is . he 's here . he 's with
[162/1000]	my parents were too busy to care . " i do n't want to go . " " you wo n't go . you 've already agreed to stay here with me . " " i do n't
[163/1000]	" what if he does n't even know he 's mine ? " " no one is trying to break you up . he 's trying to hold you that close to how much he cares about you .
[164/1000]	" it 's bad inside , " she said on a gasp . " it can be worse . keep walking . " " you saw what i did , " she said , lifting her head .
[165/1000]	he is dead , he is fading , i am still alive , he does not look like the original that lived . and those words are so depressing that the old one , the older one 's old
[166/1000]	" no . that 's about all you need . " " you do n't have to feel bad - " " i do n't ? " she asked . he considered her words . " no
[167/1000]	" the last time i saw her , she shot someone in the head . " i gave the phone a nervous shiver as i read the screen . he was right . they turned off the main road and
[168/1000]	" where are we ? " " there 's a forest . " kate moved her gaze around the cabin . " what do you have here ? " " a huge tent , filled with camping
[169/1000]	i laughed . " it has been , what ? a year since we 've spoken ? or ten , you might as well call it ? we 're both adults , we know how it ends . i 'm
[170/1000]	" yes , " she replied lightly , " i can see that . " the nurse put a finger under my chin and lifted my face up to meet her bright blue eyes . " you are going
[171/1000]	after hours , we found the fire pit hidden beneath the oak trees . we gathered in a circle around it , and i held a stick ready in my hands . i felt as if i 'd been running
[172/1000]	she looked up in surprise and said , " what ? " " i just wanted to make sure you were n't making a mistake . i remember now . when i walked into the study of our president
[173/1000]	" look with your eyes , " he ordered sternly . " can you see them move ? " he kept his eyes on my face , then shifted them to my left arm . i watched in silence
[174/1000]	" are you sure ? " " yeah . as sure as i 'm going to get , " i smirked , knowing how this was going to go . i picked him up and started back home
[175/1000]	" it 's a good idea , " i say , before i realize it . i put my head in my hands and sigh . " he 's been right all this time . he 's right that i
[176/1000]	he smiled even wider . " no , no , no . we 're not leaving . but as long as i can keep going to the front , we 'll be okay . " " what are you
[177/1000]	" thank you , sir , " the uniformed officer said . he was about fifty - something but gave jack a wide - eyed look like his name was like going into hospital . " but would n't you
[178/1000]	though she seemed to be taking all this in , after a while she broke from his grasp and took a seat on the floor at his feet while he knelt over her . she was shivering from the cold
[179/1000]	" why do n't you come and see for yourself , if i can , " she said , pointing toward the open archway . she hoped that was n't a dismissal . it was n't until he smiled and
[180/1000]	" one more thing . " i put my hand on the door <EOS> , and my voice was suddenly quiet . if i were a normal person , i would have wanted to slap myself for saying it ,
[181/1000]	" no , " he says , " no , i did n't . i had to do it . " " why ? " " i have to , " he explains quietly . " because you
[182/1000]	he could n't help but smile . " so what will it be ? " with a touch of his hand against the back of her neck , he pulled her to him , taking her mouth with his .
[183/1000]	" you did n't know ? " " i did n't know until tonight in bed . the police did n't speak to me until today morning , asking me where i 'd been all of friday night .
[184/1000]	' no , i did n't . ' ' why should n't you ? ' she hissed . ' you 're a psychopath . people get hurt . ' ' and what 're you going to do ,
[185/1000]	* * * before reaching the border , i changed . i changed . not for life , but for destiny . it was n't until i stepped onto the street where the line extended up
[186/1000]	" are you hungry ? " he asks . i nod and smile . " it feels so good to be out of my sweats and tank top . " one side of his mouth tugs up into
[187/1000]	" no , only the last two , " i confirmed . " oh yeah , i forgot . so what are we going to do ? " she asked . " i 'm not sure . i
[188/1000]	" oh my god , " she whispered stupidly , her mind running through all the ways he could fit her . " i 'm not wearing a bra . " " ah . " nolan grinned and reached
[189/1000]	you can not go , he reminded himself , but he could want to put the car on , he could not stand to ride it , he was still angry at her for the way they had just had
[190/1000]	i pulled away , and she raised an eyebrow . " you like it ? " " yes , " i said , " but it 's too expensive . " " so you 're paying for pizza
[191/1000]	" i know that some people feel they got caught up here in this valley but we took it in steps , especially with the troops they gave us . " they continued their driving and within minutes they
[192/1000]	' no problem , ' said victor . ' or shall i say so for a variety of reasons ? ' ' it wo n't be as bad as it sounds , ' said carrot cheerfully . ' who
[193/1000]	" no , just - " was all i got out before i realized she was saying it to me . " i 'm sorry . i 'm just having a hard time thinking . i feel like ... well
[194/1000]	" with my head , then ? " he sighed . " sometimes . " " this has to be so hard for you two , " i said . " it 's not the same for
[195/1000]	' i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , ' she said . ' you 're just talking in riddles . where is this new building ? ' ' down there . if it 's mine i
[196/1000]	" you 're on , " he said with such a confident grin that i knew he 'd worked the issue of the date out . chapter nineteen " that was fun ! " " did you
[197/1000]	" that 's too bad , " she said , a tinge of sadness in her voice . " i 'd love to see you tomorrow . " he stopped suddenly , the image of her - his abby
[198/1000]	where was he now ? " shit , " i whispered . " i also saw your car get jacked and your car being jacked by a cop . we need to clean that up . "
[199/1000]	" it is only to help you with one minor problem . " a very old and frail lady 's voice is coming from behind them . kaya whispers something to kaya . kaya nods , looks at me
[200/1000]	" you took my book , did n't you ? " asked coraline . " i never asked for it . we never needed it . it 's a gift . and i had your book . " it
[201/1000]	" or where he 's hiding out . why ca n't we all have an army as strong as mine ? " " he 's the one after us . " " if we attack there , he
[202/1000]	" look that 's not the only thing i took , " she said finally . " me either ! " " it goes for the back door , past the carport and the trees on this side
[203/1000]	" you ca n't kill me ! " " that ? " his eyes narrowed suspiciously . " no . and your friends are n't going to come for you . " she gasped . it would require
[204/1000]	" and she 's okay with that ? " he smiled . " she 's a big fan . besides , my first week back is going to be great . i could n't wait to get away from
[205/1000]	i shake my head out of confusion . would i be able to forget what that voice had said - how my life was turned upside down ? could a girl still do those things ? if i could ,
[206/1000]	it had no such thing . they did not have room there . ' where does ' i ' come from ? ' ' <EOS> ever , that ' just what ' . ' all this they
[207/1000]	so , he must have really been a vampire , or at least possessed of something else that could send them scurrying , running , cowering , screaming as if they were in a fire . and who would n't
[208/1000]	" are you serious ? " i asked . " you are ... i thought that you ... " " no , not my type . " she grabbed her glasses and set them on the counter . "
[209/1000]	it did n't matter . she was n't in any shape to go running back home to where she 'd grown up . they could n't send her back there . " is there another way out of here
[210/1000]	the men raised their rifles obediently . smith , si rus , and kowalski followed in time with the retreating jeep . randi and smith did n't get to talk to her further . the gunfire was accompanied by
[211/1000]	she watched the ground , her body tense but not in any way prepared to attack . they ran , running for what she could n't believe were miles during the rest of the journey , but then they came
[212/1000]	" like that , " he said . " this is it , all over for me . i ca n't think of any other path , so what does it hurt ? " " what does it hurt
[213/1000]	" who is he ? " " a cousin . jack 's cousin . a very good cousin . " " why has he not come ? and what does he want ? " " not a
[214/1000]	" well , " he said , suddenly nervous . " i mean , i did . " " why ? did you have some sort of secret lover that you 're trying to hide ? " he
[215/1000]	" when mr. k line moved in with us , we thought he was on our side . " " i understand . " it would suck for me to be a parent . i was already in far
[216/1000]	it would have been the perfect time to give her an extra night to relax and relax his hands . he almost had . he 'd been hard up all night long . not just hard , but hard and
[217/1000]	he looked at her in confusion . " what ? " " i love it , " she said . " it - it 's you , so very different from before . " he turned a page
[218/1000]	" all right then , " said ransom . " i shall keep you safe , " she said . " but you must go where i can not . what am i to do for you ? ''
[219/1000]	he must have figured out which car was hers because he dropped his tools into the bucket . " yeah ? " he said from the driver . i knew he was probably sitting beside me , because his
[220/1000]	but how could ... you could n't ? " if you really did help them at all , why would you have kept from them or had a secret place in them ? " the cop chuckled . "
[221/1000]	he leaned forward and pressed his forehead to mine as i whispered , " be smart . do n't fall for this shit . but i 'll give him a week . but that 's all he 'll get .
[222/1000]	" that sounded like the last straw . " he pulled the pen out of the leather pouch , and used it to tie a piece of cloth around his right calf . " it 's a terrible thing
[223/1000]	" i do because i 've seen movies . you 're a girl . girls do n't do girls . that kind of thing comes from being used before they can touch 'em . " my hand rose to my
[224/1000]	in addition to that , his name was harry rex scan lon . not only was he and the other inmates on the floor , which he now occupied quite a handful of , but he was also in charge
[225/1000]	no ... but was he really going to do this ? he began to walk across the room . she could see his lips moving , heard his voice ... " get her into the spare room ,
[226/1000]	" yes , the new orleans air force has a way of bringing out the worst in soldiers . we 're not going to waste a single minute , just take out the bastards with the worst . "
[227/1000]	" are you going to leave me alone here ? " " not for tonight , " she said , and then , " i might leave if you promise to behave . " his laugh echoed through
[228/1000]	" i should get back to work then . " she pushed away from the stove and went ahead and put out the steaming pot of coffee . " give me a chance , then , " he
[229/1000]	" uh ... not really . " " she came to see me , with instructions . she said that this afternoon that she wanted me to bring the computer with me . " i glance back at beth
[230/1000]	" the thing is , they do n't know how to track them down . they 're not interested in the humans , they 're interested in humans . they 're like a gang that 's so much bigger than
[231/1000]	" i was n't sure how to respond to the letter ; i mean , i did n't know what to say , " said joseph . " he really thought he could bully me . and that is the
[232/1000]	" i mean , most of the people who live in the village there get it mixed up with some other stuff that makes them very unlikely to get the idea of one of them being a ghost - and
[233/1000]	i was surprised by how much my brain was burning and not being able to say a word . " how do you think she got out ? " he said . i shrugged , not quite knowing
[234/1000]	chapter seventeen " well , i was at the gym too and made sure he had n't walked through all the hallways to his office . " " so he saw you ? " she pointed to
[235/1000]	" yes . " " you had my back . that night and for two years after , until you decided you could n't live without me . " i stare at him , trying to think of
[236/1000]	" i can tell ! " replied the wizard who still wore the mask ! " it looks so different from the mask that i could n't see it before , " said lo . they stared one
[237/1000]	" well , if that 's all there is to it , " i said . " i 'll go ... " " oh ! " he leaned back suddenly and his hand flew to his chest . he
[238/1000]	i would call in the sheriff and the state law , but on the off chance that there might not be a warrant , sheriff johnson would have a more direct call to the sheriff , should anyone , although
[239/1000]	" you come over here , " he whispered as his eyes roamed over her . she smiled and held her hands out . " come and let me give you my hug . " she slid up the
[240/1000]	" you would n't be interested in my life if you did n't . " " oh ? " she smirked at him , then shifted to her knees , grabbing her long , bare feet in midair .
[241/1000]	" why do you need to do this ? " the dog looked like he was considering it over . a few drops of saliva formed at its small mouth . " you are not a monster ,
[242/1000]	" what do you mean , like , what my eyes are n't even able to see ? i should be able to see . " we were on the same side of the cliff , now . he
[243/1000]	she grabbed the knife as she came in with it down on the counter , the steel stabbing into the light . she flipped the switch , and he saw the back of the knife , which glowed a bright
[244/1000]	" do you remember me ? " that was a loaded question , but of course , what would i say ? i was in denial and yet seemed to have recovered . however i did n't know how
[245/1000]	i 'd made up by making up a special dinner for us . it was a romantic setting and we both tried to put it out of our minds the best we could . " i was going to
[246/1000]	" well , we did n't go far really . i guess we got in a fight . " " but - " " i was stupid . i 'm not a bully , i 'm just a
[247/1000]	i did n't want to fight with him anymore . there was n't the strength , but everything seemed to help him . the pain in my chest lessened as we sat without words there . " i feel like
[248/1000]	" where ? " he opened his eyes ; they were bleary , but not groggy . something cold hit his face and rubbed it . " uh ... " " over there . " she pointed to
[249/1000]	" it 's just lunch , " he replied , clearly trying to placate her . " lunch ? what for ? " she sounded genuinely puzzled . " i think it 's time we talked . look
[250/1000]	" i know , " she said , sniffling slightly . " and i do n't blame you . " he 'd heard enough of the story of how she 'd ended up in his house , and he understood
[251/1000]	she had n't wanted me to know about any of it . it was already too painful on her own . " she died before i was able to catch her . " " you ca n't tell me
[252/1000]	" fine , " he said shortly . " i 've done what i can , " she said , the sincerity and compassion in her voice cutting through his numbness and making him want to hit something .
[253/1000]	" that 's what i like about you , " noah says in kind . " you do n't sound like someone who 'd be interested in a little sex before opening a new one . " " i
[254/1000]	" he 's going to look at it ? " " of course . he 's a detective . he 'll come over here and i 'll tell him what 's happened . " while mary had been
[255/1000]	he shook his head . " i know too much about those who have not been proven trustworthy . i know it 's not her fault . she made a good discovery . " " i agree . "
[256/1000]	" it 's all right . i 'm here . " i tried to sit up - to go into the bathroom - and found that i 'd been stretched out too long . exhausted with sleep deprivation ,
[257/1000]	" i did the same thing to yours once we had our accident , " she said quietly , the words like knife blows , slicing through to her soul . " yeah , right , " he scoffed
[258/1000]	' oh , right ... ' ' and the rest of that stuff looks in order . ' the little girl said : ' do you think it looks as bad as it looks ? i do n't
[259/1000]	" have you heard from him ? " " i called him and said we 'd meet tonight and talk . he was n't home . " he rubbed his palm into his forehead and gave her another
[260/1000]	" it 's not here , " said the ghost of frank , " i did n't see this . " " i do n't want to believe it , but i believe you , " i said .
[261/1000]	" it 's all right , " he said , " for me to - to try , i mean - " " no , there 's no need . " his gaze narrowed sharply on her upturned face
[262/1000]	" with the new body i found this morning , it 's quite a change . " the vampire seemed slightly uneasy with the conversation , but he recovered quickly , handing over the keys to the car . i
[263/1000]	" let 's start building on this , " i said . i moved forward and took the flashlight . " i 'll start at the base . my back is facing this area . next , i 'll
[264/1000]	not exactly a surprise . " why were you looking for me ? " she asked . " without any of the other help you have . " he was getting suspicious , and the only way she could
[265/1000]	" well , we used to be friends . that was until ... " " what ? " " we used to go to the same school and i 've lost count of the number of times i
[266/1000]	i know her a little over a week . you 're obviously not going around telling everyone that you 're not attracted to her . i should have done that a long time ago . maybe if you went out
[267/1000]	" i 'm only going to tell you this once , my love , and it has to do with your father and me . " " do ? " " yes , i 'm sorry . but
[268/1000]	" what do i do ? " i asked him . i was n't actually asking if i could see the souls , but if i could see it , i wished he could see me . i wished only
[269/1000]	" i got it . " in the privacy of his bedroom , cole grabbed our t - shirts hanging from the back of the door and threw his arms around me , hugging me tight . while i
[270/1000]	" what do you tell your friends ? do they understand ? " " they will figure it out . they 'll figure it out . i promise . " " i am so sorry . i do
[271/1000]	" what 's an angel ? " " an angel . an old creature called an angel of nature . " he took her hand in his . " is it different because you 're on your feet
[272/1000]	he smiled in return , her heart did a happy little dance . " she got out last night . " if that did n't make her a little nauseous , nothing would , either . still , the
[273/1000]	" the best ones come up with a way to get them free . it 's the only way you know how . " " you 're really a genius , " jeremy commented . " i had
[274/1000]	the idea of getting out of it all made emily 's eyes water . " i love you . " he smiled wickedly . " you always say the worst . " he leaned in and playfully bit her
[275/1000]	the two stood in the kitchen , listening as my mother worked herself into a fit over the fact that my brother had broken an ankle when he was fourteen . she could n't stop talking about me like
[276/1000]	a strange feeling of despair swept over me . this was the beginning of the end . i wanted to be a part of it . i wanted to be the one who brought this all to an end .
[277/1000]	" you sure ? that 's great , because i just - i just do n't know what to say . " he stops with the fork halfway off a chunk of steak . " and do n't pretend like
[278/1000]	" but you 're lying . " " i did n't do it . " i stopped walking . " just tell me i have n't been a fool , but i want to make sure you
[279/1000]	it was difficult for me to meet her eyes . she stood at what was in her arms , and i closed them . when it registered that she was really crying , i began shaking from head to toe
[280/1000]	she heard a creak as he turned the handle . the door swung open . inside the room , the room was empty . was she still dreaming . slowly he took her by the hand and led
[281/1000]	" the way your eyes follow him ? " i asked , my stomach curdling . " if he was a vampire , yes . " " but did n't it already show ? the fact that we
[282/1000]	the look was still on her face , though she glanced at his hand again , and then at his hand again . " you 're not just another whore , " she said at last , her voice
[283/1000]	" is there something wrong ? " " no , of course not . it 's fine . where were you - ah , here i am . " " sorry i 'm late , " he said
[284/1000]	" she must have seen something and called the cops . " the officer pointed to the back of the station . " he probably ran out for you before you called the cops . " " a
[285/1000]	" that 's it ? " said haven as marius helped her sit up . " i knew your head was hurting -- how does a broken bone feel ? oh , wait ! " she laughed because her face
[286/1000]	" i 'm fine ! i just want to rest . " " okay , maybe we should talk to the police . " " oh , no , no , we ca n't . they wo n't
[287/1000]	" a woman is not the one without my heart . " she snorted . " you like to tell me that . " she grabbed the doorknob and twisted . it would n't open . she twisted again
[288/1000]	" he had n't heard from him and she was worried sick about him . she went to see him after taking you and your dad away for the night one of our guests came to see him . "
[289/1000]	" she did n't mean to , " said ben . " she was just worried about you . i could tell . " i looked at him and wondered for a second why i was worried . he
[290/1000]	he nods . the smile fades from his face . " i just need to check in a few minutes . i ca n't say too much about other people , but it 's nice to meet you !
[291/1000]	" i 'm guessing the ' my son ' is already in the air . probably going to rescue a damsel in distress and she 's in a hurry to get home , does n't that make me a hero
[292/1000]	" i thought that was you ? " ben turned to where the voice came from and saw a dark shadow move between the tombstones . he had been so intent on admiring the headstone that he had hardly blinked
[293/1000]	' come on , ' he interrupted . ' how about if you tell me more about it even if it 's nothing important ? ' ' okay , ' i capit ulated . ' good , good
[294/1000]	you 're so sweet , she wrote . she was n't ready for that . she did n't have time for someone sweet . she did n't have everything she needed ; she did n't have anyone or anything
[295/1000]	he sighed and leaned forward , his elbows on his knees . " and you , sarah . you look so guilty . please come in . " she slipped inside , her footfalls hesitant . the house was
[296/1000]	" you 'd be surprised at how many times a year the people in this town look thirty minutes late . that 's because they have n't gone on vacation for at least the second time in three months ?
[297/1000]	" hello . " " i - i - " the detective seemed nervous . he took a step toward me . i glanced at haruki , who nodded as if to say , " ready , " so
[298/1000]	" please tell me you 're joking , " he cried . " no , " she whispered , taking a few hesitant steps toward him . the look on his face was like that of a broken bird
[299/1000]	" they 'll kill him . " " then you 'll come with me , " i said . he grabbed my hand . " you do n't need me . " " of course i do
[300/1000]	" is everything all right ? " she knew that , but she just wanted to know . " i 've been in there as a guest but ... " that was how he 'd come inside .
[301/1000]	while she stood there in the freezing rain , she was able to let herself appreciate just how beautiful the land was before those cold winds started hammering her and blowing her hair all the way down to her stomach
[302/1000]	the professor sat back down and thought for a moment . " i think there must be but one way to find out . " i heard the urgency in dr. evon 's voice . more importantly i recognized it
[303/1000]	he seemed about to lift his voice , then coughed thickly . " you might have guessed . " " guess ? " she asked . " about what ? " " a good many things . "
[304/1000]	that night , the following afternoon , she sent an email to the school . her father replied , she sent a list of questions . her mom , who was much happier about reading that first and final answer
[305/1000]	i want to say sorry . i remember how she 'd reacted , how she 'd walked away from people like dad , and i 'm happy that she ca n't do so now . but i 'm not about
[306/1000]	" that 's a good one ! " asked mary ann . " i guess . it 's not something i really need to talk about , but i would not have believed it if i had n't seen
[307/1000]	his parents were on a honeymoon in hawaii . he had no other family nearby so he was taking the family away to celebrate each other 's birthday . he and his father had made an oath . he
[308/1000]	" it would be better if i found some other person . in my experience they are always lonely . " " maybe you should walk with me . " " no . i 'm not going anywhere
[309/1000]	she shook her head . " tell me . " " i ca n't . " he looked at her with apology in his eyes and a quiver in his hands . ' " why not ? do
[310/1000]	' no , no , do n't bother mr michaels . you 've made your point clearly ; i will give the statement to the media . everyone will know about them by tomorrow at the earliest . '
[311/1000]	" i have a meeting to go to so do n't try to contact me anytime soon . your message said the meeting is at twelve am . " " thanks sam , i 'll see you tomorrow and
[312/1000]	" are you sure you want to ? i can buy you a drink at dinner . we can do what you want if that is what you really want . " " it 's fine , " i
[313/1000]	" no , but then ... i never can tell if people are scared or glad that you have returned . do you understand what i mean , my friend ? " " yes , " said bod .
[314/1000]	he pulled his hand away , but the warmth lingered on his skin and then she was reaching for his jeans . she pulled them down around his ankles . his c * ck swelled until he could be sure
[315/1000]	oh god , really ? because she could n't imagine her poor parents , poor people like her parents being forced to adopt . they 'd had to worry about a husband and family every day for a long time
[316/1000]	" that will be enough ! " hissed the old man at us . the ancient , yellow - faced man did not reply , but his jaw was quivering , and his eyes were full of fire .
[317/1000]	i was silent . i was also trying to decide where i wanted to go , but i just did n't know . i was a girl who grew up alone and did n't care for things that are n't
[318/1000]	" the one in the top hat , " she murmured out loud . an hour later , when they were done with their chores and had finished the small meal they 'd had , it was time for
[319/1000]	he looked at the bed and then at her . " why are n't you hungry ? " he asked . that was the next answer . she was not hungry . not in anger or fear . she
[320/1000]	" i 'm trying . i am . " he slid a hand behind her knee and drew her pants up higher , pushing his fingers beneath of the fabric to search her hot , wet core . " but
[321/1000]	the first words out of his mouth was a single , loud , " what ? " emma glared at him , trying to ignore the flutter of nerves that was suddenly making her heart pound against her rib
[322/1000]	" how ? " i asked , and i felt the anger rush up through me again ; why he had kept me from the mission was beyond me . " have you ever felt nothing like it ?
[323/1000]	i said nothing , my mind completely blank . a strange calm had set over me as i watched him . my eyes began to droop , and it did n't take long until the first wave of darkness began
[324/1000]	" well , we all had a good dinner , and now i have a whole new list of things to do . i ca n't believe you let my daughter sleep for another two hours without asking me a
[325/1000]	the voice of the witch reached them . " you failed <EOS> there , mother . but i shall add one more thing : you will never speak of this again . you will never speak of that night .
[326/1000]	" what ? " ivy said , coming to a stop . i thought she looked just as frightened as i felt . maybe it was because i was n't moving or because i could sense that ku'sox had the
[327/1000]	" i ca n't do this . " " then do n't . " the words are spoken quickly and then there is still nothing more to say . the second you see the light , i go
[328/1000]	and that scared her . chapter 2 : the mission to the top a short while earlier , agent bradley had pulled the trigger of the surveillance unit against one team of cops at a las vegas casino
[329/1000]	" okay ? " she nodded . " i ca n't get back to sleep . " " if i try , i might wake up ? " if they all took turns at falling asleep , she 'd
[330/1000]	i sighed and sat up , pushing past her . who is he ? the picture in my hand made me tense . my mom . then i stood up , quickly making my way to my
[331/1000]	" do you think ? " " yes . i do . " she laughed , her mouth and his cock twitching with the desire for her . he wanted her at his mercy . needed them like
[332/1000]	but how would he find out ? and right now , i did n't want him to think i was a flake , either . " how did you know about that ? " i asked . he
[333/1000]	the thought hit him hard . where does that leave him ? has he even got that far inside him ? how did he even know where their relationship was headed ? they 'd moved on with the relationship and
[334/1000]	" well , i 'm not very good at having sex , but hopefully , you 're good at it . " she said . " so , we got a little down and dirty there for a minute ,
[335/1000]	the image of the woman went blank . then the image of the woman left the table and went to the table , where she sat down and began to watch and listen . the music got louder and
[336/1000]	" the lady 's back ! " " well done , lad , " the soldier praised me , patting me firmly on my shoulder . i turned to see the girl running down the hill . she looked
[337/1000]	" oh , yes . i 'm afraid you 'll have to be very very careful . the girl you gave me in - it broke like a balloon inside me . you must n't worry , my darling .
[338/1000]	' they were a young couple , were n't they ? ' the boy prodded the figure by nudging him again . ' and , er , i mean , how can you tell between a boy and an old
[339/1000]	" come in ? " when he did ... her breath caught . he was dressed like a biker , complete with helmet , tattoos and red plaid button - down shirt . there was a black leather
[340/1000]	" yeah . with the gun . " " your little girl ? " " she 's all right . " " so what happened ? " now a strange energy filled the room . i
[341/1000]	i sat back in my chair . " there 's more i need to say , " said the cop . " there 's more that i do n't have . " * * * " yes
[342/1000]	" can you believe that he 's a cop ? " i ask , sipping my tea . " my mama was an actress , " caulder says . " really ? " " well , no
[343/1000]	" i would n't say no if you asked . " " why not ? " olivia asked . " because i 'll be dead in five minutes . " eve blew out a breath of frustration .
[344/1000]	" sure , " he said . " tell me then , what would you have been doing like a kid from the bus on the fourth of july ? " " hiking , " i said . "
[345/1000]	" or maybe she was the queen until the same time that she came to my world . " or it was impossible to know until she told me the truth , which was good since it meant someone could
[346/1000]	" what the fuck is going on ? " alex screams . " do it ! " he starts to walk towards me , shouting my name . alex grabs my arm and spins me toward the closest table
[347/1000]	he nodded . " that 's true . " " i 'll be right back . " i knew the nurse would n't want to interrupt my nap , so i used her distraction to gather my things ,
[348/1000]	" are you asking me to marry you because you think it 's in the best interest of the people in this family ? " " i do n't know what to say , " i stammered . "
[349/1000]	" get out of her sight , " i yelled . " i 'm going to ask her to turn around . " i dropped to my knees by her side . the one woman had n't moved ;
[350/1000]	" what 's happening ? " " the air is getting stale . so much so that no one can walk through , " i said , drawing in a sudden gasp of air . as we approached the
[351/1000]	she nodded , and then glanced at her hands as she stared at the ground . one by one , one , they glanced at a map so big it covered most of the surface of the table .
[352/1000]	but there was a chance things did n't work that way . she turned up her nose and her chin level with the wall . " it was n't that way . " " you would n't tell
[353/1000]	" i do n't know , " i tell him . " the same way i know you do n't really understand what i do . " " i guess . " i hear the disgust in his voice
[354/1000]	" my friend , here . i have always liked to spend time with him , and he is a great guy . but you mean more than just sitting around drinking beer in the bar . he feels like
[355/1000]	" that depends , " he said , his brow furrowing , obviously trying to decide . " on what ? " " on how you feel about me . have i been too much of a distraction
[356/1000]	i was about to turn to walk back when i turned past the hotel that housed the one and only hotel in the world , and i saw the big red house with the blue shutters and the pink wrought
[357/1000]	he sighed . " well , i had her go get the bags and return them to the car , but that did n't take long . " " should 've taken longer . " " she and
[358/1000]	" is that what this is all about ? " claire just managed a small smile . " no way . you have to call me honey . " and she did , and then she was lying on
[359/1000]	the air was clear , still , there was not a single cloud in the sky . no wind or rain . he smelled it , did n't like the smell , it was like the ocean but salty ,
[360/1000]	" okay , " i say . with that i walk out of the room , feeling better than i have in months . * ' 9 it 's hard not to listen when the girl who knows
[361/1000]	" what are you going to do in my absence ? " king to ren addressed the servant , and i knew that he did n't doubt what he was seeing . for once , the king seemed genuinely concerned
[362/1000]	" let 's go , " he said over his shoulder . " i want to call my mother . " i looked over my shoulder again , at a small boy with hair the color of hot coals
[363/1000]	i did n't take time to wonder why he 'd stopped . i closed the door behind me . " where have they taken her ? " i asked as i ran down the stairs in a blur .
[364/1000]	" i 'm a bit out of practice . let us talk about something else . " she seemed to pause , then said , " all right . " " why do you keep working at the
[365/1000]	" if it was n't for me , they would n't have made it , " i say . " at least , not on my watch . " he leans forward in his seat slightly so his hand
[366/1000]	nick returned his stare with only a measure of irritation . he was n't entirely sure how to handle this , but he had no real desire to explain himself in front of these people . for one minute
[367/1000]	" i do not know . " she turned and walked away over the land . " can you get word to the captain that we 're coming ? " " yes , missy , but i think you
[368/1000]	" why not ? " " because you 're beautiful . and sweet . i admire that , so i said to myself , ' why not ? ' of course , your heart is full of happiness .
[369/1000]	" you realize tonight is the first night of the rest of your life . it would be the first time you would feel safe . especially as the days , as we now call them , would turn into
[370/1000]	" we will be in london at eight o'clock . " he nodded . " be outside in five minutes . " she did n't wait for him to say anything more . there was no need .
[371/1000]	" ah , so " - she seemed to be talking to herself - " it 's more important to look more at the evidence , is n't it ? " he did n't answer . " the
[372/1000]	it did sound promising at the beginning . " that will only work for the last two days , " she said to it . she saw the reaction on the snake 's face , the horror in its
[373/1000]	" and a woman , " he said , and they were both silent again . " can we have children ? " he nodded , " sure , i can arrange that . " he kissed her
[374/1000]	there are always more of us on the base . the military would n't dare come here unprotected . " come here , " i say in my best alpha male voice , but my voice sounds like i
[375/1000]	" i do n't know , " he said . " she thought he 'd used her as a bargaining chip . i do n't think she saw any reason to waste time investigating . " " no ,
[376/1000]	" she 's a nice lady - kind , caring . " mr. ho bbs looked back down at the papers . " of course , she has been very upset concerning your father , and worried about his fate
[377/1000]	the doctor looked around with a wicked smile and asked , " is this so ? you are very quiet and almost solemn ; are you worried in the least ? " jay looked at jay and sat up
[378/1000]	i laugh . " did n't you ever have regrets about taking me the first time ? " " not really . " she shrugs . " sometimes i think i 'm a lucky virgin . usually it 's
[379/1000]	" i 'm not surprised she ended things . i am . " " so am i. " he was , but she could n't help wondering if he 'd ever let her come back if she got
[380/1000]	" what did you do to the guy ? " john asked as he moved into the kitchen . " what we think , " she replied defensively . " i was planning to leave , but you guys
[381/1000]	his own anger roiled and began to simmer , the emotion directed at her inability to believe he was capable of such an act . " what have you seen on that phone ? the news ? the media ?
[382/1000]	" okay ... <EOS> really ? " " get the best look . and that 's right , go . " " shit ... ok , " he thought . " and now she starts . "
[383/1000]	" ' tis true . " al f gi fu smiled . " how old were father and your mother when they told you ? " " it was two before i was able to understand them . they
[384/1000]	she glanced at the baby monitor . " she 's a bit tired . " for a moment , she sounded suspicious . " is she hungry ? " she glanced at her watch - eight minutes before
[385/1000]	that 's one of the strange things about this book , the things that have been happening to me since i turned eighty . i never know what to do , that 's the problem . by day i 'm
[386/1000]	just ... gone . <EOS> was this kind of craziness . " i did n't do anything . " " do not care , " said charlie . " you need me to get dressed over that big
[387/1000]	" i think we should start from the beginning , " she replied quietly , looking into his eyes . " it 's my mom calling , so i should probably take care of that first . " "
[388/1000]	he made a sad face and mumbled something to james . " what ? " the teenager came over to me , picked me up , and carried me back out the door . " why did
[389/1000]	" good day , everyone , " sarah said , drawing her smile . people around the circle smiled back at her , although she noticed one woman with a thin , penc iled - in nose and heavy eyeliner
[390/1000]	and then it was gone , forever . " now that ? this is insane . " " she seems like a good person , " scott said , scratching at one of the whiskers beside his mouth .
[391/1000]	" but how am i supposed to learn ? " i ask quietly , the pressure of my words pushing us close . this is the first time i have ever felt so exposed . " you should find
[392/1000]	" so , what should i do , then ? " thomas asked . she knew she should n't . she should hate him - but , no , she was n't able to . " go outside ,
[393/1000]	the boys found the abandoned house of the boy who had died in that first car accident . two brothers or only three . my father , who took his parents to the hospital and left them there when he
[394/1000]	but her instincts and gut were telling her that something was wrong . she needed to know : did jason have another girlfriend ? who were her options ? she had only one : go back to the hotel and
[395/1000]	' do n't get your panties in a bunch , ' he said . ' you 're going to get us in trouble . ' ' it 's already happened , ' i said . ' what are
[396/1000]	" be careful , " her mother said before disappearing for the day . " i will , " rema said , opening the door . her father 's study was dark , and rema hoped he was n't
[397/1000]	" with one of them having so much control over the others , i could n't keep it hidden . i need them to be convinced that you 're my princess when you really are n't . " "
[398/1000]	" here it is , " said dr. hal li well , opening the manila envelope <EOS> , and then the envelope , and then the envelope . " here it was . a good few years ago before the
[399/1000]	all of them waited quietly . " where 's your father ? " joseph finally asked . " dead , " charles said . james gasped , but did n't move . " your father ?
[400/1000]	" did you have to start again with me ? " " did you <EOS> - " " hold me here , " she said as she dragged it out , " in the middle of the night
[401/1000]	he reached out and brushed her hair from her forehead . " i did n't mean to . i 'm sorry , i should n't have said that . " " stop apologizing , " she said with a
[402/1000]	i do not know how long i was talking , but by the time i got off the phone , the tears had dried . i fell like a twig into the rain . * * *
[403/1000]	" i do n't have time . " " i can take her . " " is n't that what you 're supposed to do ? " " i do n't know what i 'm supposed to
[404/1000]	" but she 's not dead and they 're not here ! my god , what if all that 's really going on is that god knows what 's going on ? these folks are a bunch of insane !
[405/1000]	" the way he said it , ' i 'm gon na take a dump . ' " " i do n't care what he said about me . he 's got the right to be mad . "
[406/1000]	she 'd gotten what she came for - if the job went well , of course . besides , she seemed to have fallen in love with some of the new equipment . of course , there was the
[407/1000]	" i 'm surprised you let her leave so quickly . i wondered if you 'd been in touch with her . " " are you kidding ? she 's already gone . not a trace . "
[408/1000]	" that ai n't right , " i said . " what are we doing here ? " they did n't move . " my name 's bob , " i said . " you may have heard
[409/1000]	" yes , but it would be hard for me to control the power that you may have over me . " " that 's not true , " she scolded . she let go of the reins ,
[410/1000]	" sure . " i was half an hour late . even worse , i did n't find the door on the bathroom door . my heart was pounding so hard i thought it would split through my chest
[411/1000]	" thanks , " i respond , ignoring the sarcastic tone . i try to remember if i looked like a zombie when i was alive , but i ca n't really remember . there 's a brief lull
[412/1000]	chapter 9 as they landed , ava 's heart lodged in her throat . the pilot had n't boarded the plane . had n't even spoken to them yet . just asked to check out the accommodations .
[413/1000]	" i agree completely , but we ca n't exactly claim all her assets . " " oh , " she said with a sigh . " it went well , " he assured her . " you
[414/1000]	she looked back at the window of the saloon . " what do we do ? " " i do n't know . if we 're going to get out of here , we need to get inside .
[415/1000]	his gaze swung back to hers . his eyes were shadowed with a dark energy she had rarely seen - fear . fear of the dark . " i need you in the hospital . " her hands
[416/1000]	' what 's that , love ? ' stuart asked , and pressed the open button button , smiling as he spoke . ' our killer has taken a blood sample out of someone 's blood . '
[417/1000]	he heard her soft little cries of pain and grief and felt them inside him as if like a physical bite they were piercing his heart , piercing everything inside <EOS> the air . it was his brain . jesus
[418/1000]	" your mom and i are going for a run , " ben said . " you too , ellie . you too . i 'm going to start getting the fire started so we 'll go with the breeze
[419/1000]	i look over at my boyfriend nervously . " he wants to come to the party tomorrow night - i 'd like to be present . " his smile brightens with enthusiasm . " that will be fun .
[420/1000]	" my wife is supposed to be the reason i 'm still alive . " " why ? " " because my wife stole food from my wife . did n't you know that ? " "
[421/1000]	there were a million reasons she should stay away from him - all of them valid . but not all of them made sense . " i think i 'll ask him if i should leave , " zoe
[422/1000]	i followed him into the restaurant and he placed his hand on the small of my back and walked me over to a booth . i was shocked when he got us both a table secluded from the whole place
[423/1000]	" god , i miss her . " " i know . but she deserves more than this . she 's so beautiful , and you 'll be able to ask for all she 's got . when you
[424/1000]	" you knew it was n't us , " he said from the doorway . " i did ? " " i did . " she could n't refute it , so instead just smiled .
[425/1000]	" yeah . i do . i could never leave them with you . especially not after last night . " he looked away , still embarrassed over that . " and if there 's someone else , any other
[426/1000]	his eyes were trained on her throat , on her neck that was almost completely covered by her blouse . she reached out a hand to him and gently placed a finger to his lips . " do n't
[427/1000]	it was dark . claire was scared to death . and she suddenly understood what had made frank seem so different . she recalled that claire 's mother was n't here , but myrnin had returned to morganville and destroyed

[429/1000]	" your parents are on a lunch vacation at the marina , one that i 've decided to take with you . i 'm not going to ask you for permission . i want you to spend my money ,
[430/1000]	" you can read my face ? " i asked . he was sitting right beside me on the floor , and he reached out to settle his hands on my shoulders and shoulders . " i never said
[431/1000]	" what if we 're getting married ? " i asked , my heart racing . " what if i 'm the one marrying you and you 're marrying me ? " he laughed and kissed me tenderly .
[432/1000]	" oh , no . please , just do n't . it 's like making fun of me . " she was so nervous this time . " i wo n't . you can tell me about the things
[433/1000]	" how long will it take time ? " " how many years , for it is the same as when they started . i need you to make one more piece out of everything you observe . get
[434/1000]	" yes , " peter told her . " it was the biggest mistake i ever made . " " oh peter ... " peter could hear the tears in her voice . he started to back away
[435/1000]	she was n't that kind of woman . he 'd been foolish enough to invest too much time and energy into his current experiment . things had gone far beyond the current . at that moment , the air
[436/1000]	she 'd had enough of strangers and their threats . just as she could n't bear the thought of his brothers coming to her rescue ever again , she would n't have to . they never had to find her
[437/1000]	" the problem was that before he was turned , he 'd felt like he was drowning in the black . and when he 'd become a vampire , he 'd found out that some part of him was still
[438/1000]	" there 's one thing i can do to help you . they must already know that you are a friend of my sister 's . they may have noticed that you are going to the island . can i
[439/1000]	" well , the girl next door is my best friend . she 's gone off to a funeral , and i ca n't stand the thought of her out there alone . since i left work on tuesday and
[440/1000]	" so what can i help you with ? " " my name is rose . " we hold hands and the room feels so hot there 's not much room for air . " i 've been assigned
[441/1000]	" there are four of us , and we are all men , " explained lady mal m oud . " we need you to see god in his own way or else your life will be forfeit . tell
[442/1000]	he kissed my lips . " you told me i would get you , " he whispered . " do n't argue . be with me , chase . please . " i held my breath as
[443/1000]	" what ? " his hands went to his hips . " i 'm not a whore bitch , gretchen . " tears stung her eyes and she pressed her forehead into her hand . " luke - "
[444/1000]	" do n't worry . i 've got it . i 'm not too far . " " great . maybe i 'll have a cup of coffee with your group . " " just make it after
[445/1000]	that left only one word in her mind . in . " my . god . " she nearly did n't have the words out before her expression clouded with hurt . " so you 're going to
[446/1000]	i took a long sip . i was n't a big drinker . i would n't necessarily remember it when i stopped , but i would be drunk . not drunk , mostly . the party had n't consisted
[447/1000]	the people at the tables did n't seem to be paying any attention , and he realized that the couple on the far side of the room were giggling . " what would you do to some wild animal ?
[448/1000]	" i do n't think she 'll stop until she has her baby . she feels it 's part of her , and she 's trying to protect it . " " so , she 's not trying to
[449/1000]	" sure thing . i told him the same thing , but they were n't feeling too high at the moment . " he let out a laugh that might have been a snort of laughter . " probably just
[450/1000]	" i still do n't think he did it , but he 's got to be doing it , either . " " but why ? all i do is make him mad . he 's the one who
[451/1000]	" where you going ? we 're all going to need it . " " i do n't know yet , hon , " she says , a little coy . " just being in the shower , letting
[452/1000]	' but what do you think will happen to the people ? ' ' i presume they will all die of starvation on the continent . there are no other civilized peoples on this country . but i fear
[453/1000]	he ignored it . why should he care anyway ? " the answer is no . never . " he 'd thought it was difficult not to speak the truth any more than he 'd thought he was allowing
[454/1000]	" my mother had all manner of toys , " i said , remembering the beautiful black velvet box her eyes had held for me while she 'd tried to convince me to take an actual train back .
[455/1000]	" it 's too soon ! " he cried . " i do n't understand . " it was a simple question . i closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep . " i ca n't do this
[456/1000]	" if your son is such a stubborn animal , i ca n't see how you can sit here and watch him this way . " " because i feel powerless ? " she responded . i knew
[457/1000]	" then she was just plain smart . " she closed her eyes for a moment , and her breathing slowed . <EOS> completely . she pushed herself upright , stretched stiffly , then walked over to the window
[458/1000]	he did n't respond . " and that is ... what ? " i tried to shrug , but the gesture was un cooperative . " i do n't know . i just need some time to sort
[459/1000]	all in all , i think it 's an excellent thing he did that because now we can get a real explanation of why this is all happening . why we do n't take it any further . just
[460/1000]	they 'd gone home from the restaurant . " you 're right , " she said . " i 'll buy them both to celebrate . " " we should . i 've been thinking about coming to california
[461/1000]	" you 're a tough lady , " he said . i could feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment . i wanted to laugh but all i could think about was the way sebastian looked at me like i was
[462/1000]	" you really loved me that night , " paul whispered . " yes . " she squeezed his hand and gave it a small squeeze back . " oh , paul . i did n't know . "
[463/1000]	" the problem with those that do n't speak in class , " mr. king explained , " is that they start to take notes and then change their brain patterns . there are only two ways that they
[464/1000]	her voice was cold . " it 's not a matter of him making his decision later like he wants . he just does n't seem to want to stay in his hometown anymore . " " are you

[466/1000]	it was a small , flat rock , surrounded on all sides by trees , and around the base by a small trickling brook , many large frogs bobbed along its surface , and in the sun there were many
[467/1000]	" thank you for your time , ma'am , " he said . i turned and left . that was the end of two nights . one was another week of complete denial . one night , a week
[468/1000]	" what the hell do you want , danny boy ? " " i just want to ask you a couple questions . " " about what ? " " anything , really . " "
[469/1000]	" get dressed , " she told him . " we 're going to be taking off soon . " his hand gripped her arm and pulled her close until she was pressed against him . " yes
[470/1000]	it was easier this way . he hoped it was n't what he wanted . despite the fact that he had been living in an apartment , he still wanted the freedom to be alone . he liked no one
[471/1000]	" i 'm just looking , " i say , waving my finger at the bag . " hey , you 'll have to drive me back to the house . " he shakes his head . " you
[472/1000]	" you can play the book on your own time . it 's your thing , right ? " " it must . i want to hear the story about the girl . " " it 's not
[473/1000]	" wow , she said that , " michael repeated . " so that was it ? " " no , " michael said . " she said , ' i 've got good news , ' as though
[474/1000]	he was a good man . he 'd been a good man , a good kid , a good man .... she took in a deep breath and braced herself . " when you got up to her room
[475/1000]	he nodded and pressed his forehead to hers . " then maybe you 're not so broken back after all . " his grip tightened , so hard that her back burned . " you see , to come back
[476/1000]	as there was an uproar of whispers about the possible possible actions in a person 's condition , john , like most people , understood the concept of keeping quiet , especially in public , for no - one would
[477/1000]	" yes , " she answered with a wry smile . she put the car in gear and slid into the back seat . " you 're always putting things in the right places . do you have a girlfriend
[478/1000]	" what 's the matter ? " she asked . " i just realized that i do not have a shirt on , or at least , i was afraid i had one somewhere . " she pushed past
[479/1000]	" not to worry , " she reassured him as she eased off her seat , " i think he 's so lost it into his head about women he 's never caught a glimpse of ... or heard of
[480/1000]	she came again , and this time it was in a single movement , and he brought the club just where his cock had been only ten seconds before . this time she caught him by the thighs , arching
[481/1000]	he was waiting for her in the room , sitting there watching her . she sat there , unmoving , watching him . he stroked her cheek and said , " i 'm hoping this will all be over
[482/1000]	the door swung open while the other occupants of the hallway were still moving around towards the hallway . no ! no ! it could n't be . this was madness , and what was he -
[483/1000]	or not . " can anyone tell me which ? " the small house sat on a small hill . two tall wooden columns were attached to the house , and a couple of wooden chairs were scattered
[484/1000]	she nodded . " maybe . " oh . we walked a bit away from the house down the road , under a bush , before coming to a small clearing . a small creek gurgled nearby .
[485/1000]	" she did n't care more than you think , " jake said sadly . helen stepped inside the cabin . " oh , helen , are you all right ? " with a shake of her head
[486/1000]	she smiled . probably because she did n't want to , but because she could n't seem not to . " no . i guess i owe you one . " * * * in the front seat
[487/1000]	" i 'm not asking you about my job , " she said simply . " no . " she made a noise that sounded quite like a sob . she looked at him for a few long
[488/1000]	the men were angry . i 'm a virgin . she kept hearing in her mind . i am a virgin . " and i 'm not gay ! " richard yelled . " come on ,
[489/1000]	chapter twenty - four : " the best and brightest warriors of atlantis are waiting at the gates of atlantis . " ... " our ships are set up high in a range of sixty ships .
[490/1000]	and then to my surprise , the next line is a beautiful female voice that 's soft and throaty like a singer 's . " you 're a terrible liar , cole crane . it takes a lot to make
[491/1000]	" he just left , " she said , speaking around the lump in her throat . " oh . " i squeezed her hand as he walked over to my car . " thanks , mike ,
[492/1000]	as he talked , he watched her hair curl behind her shoulder , framing her face . she looked beautiful . gorgeous and very ... not . he knew he would never be the same for bella . not
[493/1000]	" when his father died - " jordan struggled to breathe , " that would be when i had my accident . " the doctors had made an appointment the day before for luce and daniel to travel to
[494/1000]	" i think the best explanation is that someone was keeping tabs on you , " jake said , staring at me . " what you did , what you 're ... i ca n't even begin to describe it
[495/1000]	" look , doc , the real question for you is : is she up for the challenge ? " he turned , nodded , frowned deeply and said , " the challenge ? " " yeah .
[496/1000]	i knew that one of them could be the right person . but i was just as baffled as him . " where is she ? " i asked . " on the balcony , " the guard said
[497/1000]	not my biggest fan . but i knew i 'd have to come in there for a good reason , and i told him all about it the second i saw him . " i 've heard of
[498/1000]	he was talking about the time she had spent in his office that day - before she left for the airport . the time he had spent using her . she was thinking that at this very moment , she
[499/1000]	" i 'm not upset at you , " i told him . " if something were to happen to you , i 'd feel sick . " i could see he still had doubts , but he pushed them
[500/1000]	he stared at her ; the flush of embarrassment deepened . his entire face had reddened . " i ... i do n't ... like doing it ... in public . " " why are you doing it ?
[501/1000]	" no , i did n't have anything to do with the divorce . " no one , but maybe she could come down off her high . could she also put in an appearance , to make herself more
[502/1000]	i nodded . " i guess . " my words sounded flat and flat as they exited my mouth . " what are you staring at , brynne ? " oh jeez , i was totally about to
[503/1000]	but the answer was no . i 'd always been unable to believe that fate held something for me . that it would keep me trapped in a constant state of utter self - doubt with no amount of guilt
[504/1000]	" yes , i know . " " i , uh , did n't know about it . i 'm not really the type to bring you up , but i love you . you 're ... everything to
[505/1000]	i waited for a moment , allowing my breath to slow . then i looked at him again . " that 's great , " i said . " you make it sound like an easy job . "
[506/1000]	there was a sudden rush of water through the open window , and a burst of breeze as the curtain was pulled back . elizabeth was back , wrapped in a towel . " ready ? " she asked
[507/1000]	" no , but i had to go to ground and talk to you and i was scared . you gave me no choice . i told you that i would stay close by and i will not let you
[508/1000]	" and if you 're wrong ? " she shook her head vigorously as if not believing it . the phone lit up . he picked it up , listened carefully , then threw it over his shoulder
[509/1000]	" it will be my pleasure . " * * * the next day , in the gym around campus , i was working out in the weight room . for the first time since i was a
[510/1000]	his name on my lips just then . it made my stomach flip . oh god . oh man . i could n't stop thinking about luke and all the ways i could destroy my life . i could
[511/1000]	" then it 's a good thing there have n't been any major accidents and we 're fine . " " that 's great , ty , " i tell him as i pick up a pillow from the
[512/1000]	" but now they 've decided how to get rid of the prisoners and they 're planning a battle . what sort of battle it is ? and who are they ? " " i 'm sorry about your
[513/1000]	" yeah . " " i 'll be back tomorrow ! " she said excitedly . i nodded and felt relieved that she had finally found my father . i had seen how much she loved my father
[514/1000]	" then i 'd say she got shot . " he looked up , and his eyes were like black glass . " so she left , " he said . " who shot you ? " "
[515/1000]	" the first man she went up to might not be as bad as ... " she frowned , glancing toward the rear garden . " but by the time she reached them , the man was gone . "
[516/1000]	" well i hope you know that you have made a huge decision , and we will start the trial very soon . we will have a preliminary trial to make sure everyone has seen our evidence and understands something
[517/1000]	her eyes came back to the mirror after she 'd done so and met his . he was looking at her with a knowing look which made her feel a little bit scared at the idea that he just might
[518/1000]	" we ... " " i can not think of any other explanation . there are no questions , my lord . " laurence did not entirely trust himself to disagree with him . the captain shrugged and
[519/1000]	" in the process , i met a rich doctor and married him . " " how happy for you , " i said , remembering mr. thornton , and my feelings for jason . " you must
[520/1000]	her expression fell . " when did you have a date ? are you supposed to be sitting down at least ten minutes ago ? " all she needed to do was ask for time off . what the
[521/1000]	i watched him turn on the shower , see the red , hot water as he stood under the show er head and waited for it to wash away the blood . outside the door i saw the car
[522/1000]	she turned on her heel and headed for the stairs . " i 'm sure he 's fine , " she lied . no , he was n't fine and she knew it , because this was the second
[523/1000]	" we only have a few minutes , " he said . " then let 's sit down , " i said . i took his arm and he helped me into the back of the car . then
[524/1000]	" would you like me to kill the girl ? " he shook his head , " no . " " then you need to stop him . you have to save her . " he stood
[525/1000]	chapter fourteen james : that day when i saw james at that church , i could n't stop thinking about him . how he looked as he kissed me . it was as if he were kissing me
[526/1000]	" you are n't dead . " " very funny . that 's what i thought . besides , why would i bring up a dead body when i did n't even know it was in the hotel room
[527/1000]	mr. white was also in excellent spirits , for a change . " the car is ready , " he announced . " i 'll handle the packages for you , " mrs. butter worth said . " that
[528/1000]	" a little bit , at least . " i lied . " good . we 'll be back . he 's outside waiting for you . he thinks you may be at the end of him . "
[529/1000]	we waited until then to go and visit my friend . it was already dark outside and we grabbed pizza from the drive home . he 'd already been driving for three hours and i wanted his energy while he
[530/1000]	the door shut . i slid my ear even closer and heard , " he 'll be back . " " okay , " i whispered , my back tipped further to luke , i could feel it
[531/1000]	" no you do n't , " she groaned again , " i ca n't even imagine where we are . my life is an experiment from now on , and i do n't believe in science . i do
[532/1000]	the rest of us rushed up to them to check on the condition of the wounded in the hospital room . " they 're all right , " said the doctor , " but we 'll be able to
[533/1000]	they ran for the main buildings of the city of rome and ran down the west route but soon burst around a bend in the river . it was a straight ride through the mountain towns and then they had
[534/1000]	" sorry that he 'll definitely be in the tabloids when he gets home , " beth said helpfully . " and no , he wo n't be there to attend me mother 's memorial service or anything . "
[535/1000]	" is there anything i can do for you ? " he tried to sound calm , but there was a tremor in his voice . " just tell me where you have been taken , " i said
[536/1000]	the man looked back at me . " we are all done . i can see i 'm not even going to get the information i intend to have . now , if those men with guns do n't mind
[537/1000]	why would n't anyone be with you ? " " when he was trying to kill me . " " i 'm sorry . " " why ? " just because i 'd fallen did n't mean
[538/1000]	" oh , i know what it was , " i grumbled , grabbing the bag and opening the bag , " this was the best lunch of my life . " i slid the food out into a large
[539/1000]	he does n't move . his gaze is on the bottle in his hand as he takes another drink . after he swallows the last of me , he opens his mouth to say something , but i cut
[540/1000]	" was something wrong ? " " yes . i just ca n't understand why you did n't use the power of the amulet . " " i did n't . i figured it was better to let
[541/1000]	' well , she was n't the only one just saying so . you look pretty happy . ' ' oh , you were there . you noticed before i moved in . ' ' were you spying
[542/1000]	" i did n't want to leave . it was too hard , " she murmured . " what ? what do you mean , too hard ? " " it was ... everything . " he
[543/1000]	she is very little , but the boy thinks she is worth ten times the loss of her mother . she 's so tiny , wrapped up in his arms , it 's difficult for the boy to remember how
[544/1000]	his hands were at his sides , the palms facing her toward the wall . she was already wondering what he 'd meant , why he 'd said he could n't sleep . she 'd tried to give him time
[545/1000]	without another word , he turned and walked away , leaving me standing there , staring after him . just for a few seconds . but this time i felt it . his touch was warm , gentle
[546/1000]	i think about the gun and my mother and the dead people and i feel that i would rather die than let that happen . " i would n't . " i say it more to myself than to
[547/1000]	he 'd forgotten to keep his phone on vibrate back in the apartment . the first time he and his wife had been married , she 'd texted him , alerting him to her birthday . she 'd been out
[548/1000]	" are you all right ? " " sure . i mean , i do n't remember a thing . " she blinked , slowly lifting her head . her hand came to rest on her cheek , and
[549/1000]	" oh , what the fuck are they doing ? " " they 're throwing sand , " i said , and put the camera down , turning toward the beach where the bodies were coming from , to
[550/1000]	my heart nearly beat out of my chest . i had to do something to save our little boy . i never brought him here . i 've never brought him here . and i never will again .
[551/1000]	" in case you forget , we have our own special charm and power circle with supernatural powers . in fact , i 'm a magician and have a similar spell under my belt and i can learn it without
[552/1000]	" i 'm not leaving , " i snarled . " i 've had enough . " i whirled around to take him down , but he had moved so fast up to the wall beside me ,
[553/1000]	" it 's not me who 's got the problem , so why do n't you go find someone else who 'd share your problems ? " said melissa . " that thing that saved your life , how
[554/1000]	she could see her small face now , the tears in her eyes , the red in the corner of her mouth . she looked like a child again , and it brought back memories of the woman in the
[555/1000]	" well . no , you could not blame my own life for that behavior , " he said . " i had to watch over you . i had to watch out for you . " " you
[556/1000]	the other side of the desk looked a little larger . the woman made a sco ffing sound . " you must be mad to turn on me like that . " her voice was soft and almost gentle ,
[557/1000]	i thought i saw tears roll down her cheeks . a sob bubbled in my throat and then burst out of my throat . " she has a pregnancy scare . we were having a boys ' night ,
[558/1000]	i have read enough crime shows to know what he 's talking about . even if this can work , i have to handle this situation any way i can . but no matter what the price , i have
[559/1000]	" so you know about all that ? " she nodded . " yeah . i met your mother . the summer we moved here . something about the way she looked . her way of saying okay .
[560/1000]	" but i 'm not one of them you 'll take into custody . " " well what do you mean ? " " i mean they 've been taking out their interest in you . "
[561/1000]	" in that case , the good news is ... the police did solve the murder , and the bad news , i agree . " " how ? " " the body was found beside the body
[562/1000]	my whole body shook . with a loud moan , i raised up and curled my legs together as he drove deep inside of me . every second that felt more hard and out of control and wrong had me
[563/1000]	a series of steps led up to a large , cylindrical laboratory . several men , ranging from the shape of infants to the size of base balls , sat at desks running in from every direction . "
[564/1000]	as for the others , the humans had seemed to be holding their own with the fae warriors . apparently some humans were in fact well disciplined , and there were good few like him out there in the big
[565/1000]	' or maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time , ' harry added . ' maybe he was going to steal them from somewhere else . or that he had stolen them from someone else .
[566/1000]	" that 's so . i did n't know they 'd come there . " matt thought of getting drunk and playing a double - game number on the radio , of sleeping there in his warm bed afterward
[567/1000]	" that 's a definite you , " he said in a low tone . " better than one of those three big strong males of yours . " a faint flush crept up her cheeks . " there
[568/1000]	his eyes are still on mine and i ca n't read them . i shrug , pretending to be interested in my drink . did n't we just go at it on the bed ? it ca n't be
[569/1000]	that 's not my style . and i 'd love it . " sounds good , " i mutter , unable to look away from him . " you 're gon na love it . " he kisses
[570/1000]	" do you have all your notes ? " " yes , sir , if you will come with me . " he gestured toward a row of cubicles . " we do n't have many , but the
[571/1000]	" you 're looking good . beautiful . even if you take after your father , he 's a hell of a man . " he chuckled . " you know , i got a few years off work at
[572/1000]	her hand clenched around the car door at the thought that he might be being chased . just as surely , he had been following her while she had run , just as surely as he had followed the other
[573/1000]	" that 's why she loves you . she 's trying to help you and show you that you can make the right decision in this big group of people . " jack gave him a crooked smile .
[574/1000]	she 's telling you she wo n't see you again . i shake my head . " you have to respect that i 'd do it for you . but let 's cut to the chase first . i
[575/1000]	i kept my gaze on the road , trying to see if there was any signs of human habitation around us . it was one of the many advantages , because we were on a road that went from the
[576/1000]	" why are you here , you bastard ? " the first thought it was a good plan to stay away from him . she should be safer here , before he got too much closer . she should be
[577/1000]	" oh , i beg your pardon ! may i have a look ? " the dowager said . " not after i have seen the man 's face , madam , " grace replied , with as much
[578/1000]	" okay . " my voice was coming out hoarse <EOS> - anything the nicest from my chest line . whatever thoughts my voice was the last to the last time , but to life entirely . i 'd been
[579/1000]	" take it , " said setrakian , " for this will be your last gift to mr. cor cor an . " eph took the revolver and said , " this gun is not for you , friend
[580/1000]	he smiled wryly . " you know , i love you for your intelligence and your ability to spot things in the dark . actually , this is a very beautiful place . " " come here , my
[581/1000]	" i have to tell you one thing , " i say to ian , glancing at lila . " he does n't look too happy to see me . in fact , he looks a little sad . honestly
[582/1000]	" yeah , of course . " the elevator doors opened up to a hallway . he had never seen the building from this height before , but it was impressive . there was a very small office located
[583/1000]	he nods silently , and as his eyes move over me and my nak * d heart rate rises , i can almost feel his eyes on me as i hold his gaze . he 's fascinated by my br
[584/1000]	" i 'm not going away , " i said more reassuringly . " i 've been there before . " he grabbed hold of me and held on , his eyes darting back and forth between mine .
[585/1000]	" where are you going ? " he asks . " it will be dark before too long . " " i have a friend 's farm . i just need a ride .... " " what friend
[586/1000]	" do n't worry , " said justin as he led them out . " we 'll make the best use of ourselves . " " i hope so , " said mae . mae 's car was
[587/1000]	' no . ' ' could you let me in ? ' ' please ? ' she looked at her mum for a long time . she had never seen her mum look this way before .
[588/1000]	there was no light anymore , no air . the blackness at least , seemed to make the tunnel smaller . the wind turned brittle as she stepped farther into it , even cold . she wished she could have
[589/1000]	there were three floors above me . it was a straight shot up , making it impossible for me to see it all at once ; instead i had to follow her down and follow her through it . i
[590/1000]	their meal - a small flat - chested man with a short black beard and an emaciated white - haired woman with long , spiky blond hair - came on and sat in the chair beside them . '
[591/1000]	" how come , " i asked him . " you 're too careful with me . i 'm the one that 's protecting you from it . " " like you thought that last week , " he
[592/1000]	" they 're moving slowly . the engine is slowing . " " are they going to make it ? " " not if i can help it . they 're going to have no other choice .
[593/1000]	" you do n't think you should <EOS> ? " the young , the old man was particularly , the one the queen , all that kind of a secret , and if something was appropriate during a sudden love
[594/1000]	" yes , the first time i saw his face , this was during the very first attack . " the only sound in the room now was the muffled thump of heavy feet on carpet . "
[595/1000]	" no need to give a shit about those kind of things . " after last night , he would have loved to have caught her just like this , but he could n't . he kissed the side
[596/1000]	the boy and i could hear him and talk to him for several moments , but my attention was wholly on the fire and the flickering light that seemed to rise from in every direction . " what a
[597/1000]	he nods with a smile and takes my hand . we walk out into the hot sunshine that is baking me dry . " do you like being outdoors ? " he asks quietly . " more than
[598/1000]	" let 's sit this one out , shall we ? " said miss tick . " there 's no point in jumping on them . " " but they might think we 're coming . " "
[599/1000]	sam went back to the house and the others did likewise after the guard left . " do n't you think it 's a little suspicious that a member of the guards had n't shown up for her shift
[600/1000]	she stood and , using her foot to push behind the chair again , she got up over it and picked up the envelope that was on the table . as she opened it , she noticed a handwritten
[601/1000]	" let 's just go , " he said , still staring at her . " maybe before too long you 'll be ready for dinner while i try to convince you the food is not what you want .
[602/1000]	' i do n't know , he said to let me look and they said they had something to show me , so i walked over to go over and look . ' i looked around the store to
[603/1000]	" do n't think so , " said haven , laughing . " all i know is there was n't a lot of room for anyone after we got here . " haven walked to the entrance of the
[604/1000]	he glanced down at me . " but i did n't want to take anything else . " i could see the pain in his eyes again and sighed . he 'd been hurt so badly . " if i
[605/1000]	i shook my head . " no . " " and so you believe me ? " " yes . " " you want to talk , you talk . " he nodded . "
[606/1000]	" okay , but i need to clean up your mess for you . " he held his hand out for me , and i obediently followed . " really ? " " really . " i
[607/1000]	" i will not do anything that will offend you ! " " you will not give her any gift , " said his first lieutenant . " none must be offered , " said the seer .
[608/1000]	his hands slipped between her thighs , cupping her very tiny feminine bottom , squeezing sweetly . " and a quick and hard ride tonight . " she shifted in her chair , spreading her legs slightly . "
[609/1000]	" the little bastard came to find you , " said frank . " he 'd been having an accident after the party , we guess a head injury up on a steep mountainside . " " that sounds
[610/1000]	he sat on the bed with his back propped against the headboard and smiled at the thought of making love to this gentle - looking woman . her stomach was flat and flat and her bare thigh was exposed to
[611/1000]	she started laughing before she managed to utter that one word . " i know . you 're going to be just fine . " the words hit him hard , and he had to turn away from her
[612/1000]	" sorry . " beth 's mouth was already dry . this was n't the first time he 'd said sorry to her . " it 's not the start of anything , " he said , trying to
[613/1000]	" you did n't ever seem that to be in the least bit interested in your mom , " i continued . i was getting tired of ignoring her words . " why not ? i 'm just surprised
[614/1000]	" are you okay ? " she glared at him , but held her tongue . the next ten minutes were spent debating everything from whether or not to agree on whether or not she 'd be able to
[615/1000]	i love you , we both cried at the same time . it was a silent hug , not so much about love , but because of the emotions of that time . i 'd seen people become torn between
[616/1000]	she knew it was the right thing to do . before he could react , she backed away , then stopped altogether . " you still have to see a therapist , " she reminded him , her voice soft
[617/1000]	he watched of me with a strange look on his face . the first time before . the first time i 'd seen him since ... " oh my god , callum ! it 's okay , " i
[618/1000]	" ' tis , " i agreed , grinning at him . " i thought perhaps to take her for a late ride , but that would be a mistake . she 'd be nervous in an unfamiliar country ,
[619/1000]	" the thing is , " said mr. smith , " but it sounds sort of like a good idea , when the answer is n't usually . " " that 's not my thing ! " said esk
[620/1000]	from her other arm she flipped open a small purse and took out a wad of cash . with a flick of her wrist , she held up a tiny pen . " i 'll need you to fill these
[621/1000]	" when did we take over your house ? " " two days ago . " suddenly i could n't breathe . i was hyperventilating . i was shaking so much . mrs. j. walked over to the
[622/1000]	but that just left the big house with it . " i 'm sorry ! " i said desperately . " i was only angry with her . i did n't mean to make you mad . but this
[623/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i paused again , my voice rough . " a friend had an accident when he was sixteen and we stopped by to - " he cut me off with a
[624/1000]	he 'd never stopped to think about the consequences of his actions . he 'd had no business . had n't liked it . he 'd been more upset by the anger and the fact that those feelings had triggered
[625/1000]	as he watched me approach with my hands in my hair , i silently pleaded with him to make it go away , because something in the back of my mind warned me that he was going to take me
[626/1000]	" you 're being ridiculous , " i say to him . " what was in the file ? " " you said i was n't being ridiculous . i said i was being . " " you
[627/1000]	they did as they were bade . the sergeant called to the sergeant to report the situation and he arrived just as the new arrival had finished his conversation with the police officer . as he entered the guard
[628/1000]	his friends waited , with him in a huddle , while emma worked in the kitchen . <EOS> really liked the way grandma 's mom . " so far up in the attic . the kind that sleeps a
[629/1000]	" you will remain un molested , " said the king . " do not make that mistake again . no one will attempt to harm you . no one . do you understand ? " i nodded my
[630/1000]	i shake my head . " she was drunk . " " who ? " " just let it go , okay ? things will settle down . " " i do n't know . "
[631/1000]	" why do n't we walk into the studio first ? " julia suggested as she got out the keys to the cam cor der and the box of film . " okay . " they walked to
[632/1000]	" well , i 'm going to go make sure sam is okay , " said nathan when he came back . " i do n't want mrs. burke to worry so much . " " yeah , i
[633/1000]	" we 'll talk about it when you get home , " replied trixi , her voice still full of rage . " now get out of here while you can . " * * * they were
[634/1000]	" well then , it 's on your neck , dear . " and in the blue , cloudless sky , sarah leaned on the wooden railing that overlooked the blue sea and watched the two of them .
[635/1000]	when he came this close to her again , she remembered seeing his lips against her ear . she squeezed her eyes shut . was he going to kiss her again ? he stopped behind her and started to
[636/1000]	" i know that , " she replied , staring directly into nathan 's eyes . after a few seconds , he began to take a step back . " wait ! " i said , grabbing his arm
[637/1000]	a moment later , jake came back with a tall , broad - shouldered guy with sandy - brown eyes . " i can take you to your car , " he said , " but you 've got to
[638/1000]	" what ! " " i said he was a good guy . a great guy , and a friend of my dad 's . good friends . and he used to bring his fiancée to a wedding on
[639/1000]	" what can be done about it ? " i asked , although i already knew the answer . not before we put the hex on him . " we 'd better keep him in his room until we
[640/1000]	" come on man , you need to get out and move out , " adam told him . " you should put in a good word with the university press or something . " ethan 's eyes turned
[641/1000]	there was no doubt about it - this was not a woman who lived in a trailer park or lived in a fancy apartment complex . she 'd been through her fair share of fights , and at one point
[642/1000]	" and he knows where the bathroom in the suite is , right ? " she says . " yeah , he knew . " " when did i start ? " she starts rubbing her left temple
[643/1000]	" where is my wife ? " he asked . " you ca n't call her , " said the chief , " she 's sick . she ca n't go to the hospital at all . "
[644/1000]	the next man with the gun had come up within half a second before he fired . the first hit his left shoulder , causing his weapon to go off . the second bullet exited through his eye and the
[645/1000]	" how did this all go down ? " i asked her when we all parked . " i do n't know any of those things , " she said . " but your brother told eric about what
[646/1000]	" i want to marry you . " she was aware that she was saying the words with such conviction that she felt they could come to pass any moment . " again ? " he had n't expected
[647/1000]	" a little . " " i do n't ... " i stopped , biting my lip as if i were at a loss for words . the idea of going against a god did n't seem like
[648/1000]	" there 's a job to be done . " she turned to show him her face , her shoulders as tall as the cave . " there are more of you and more of us waiting for you .
[649/1000]	he 's trying to tell me something . all he 's telling me is , " you 're a beautiful bride and the prettiest bride i 've ever seen . i need to find out what 's on that
[650/1000]	" i 've got to find him . give me your watch . " " why ? " " just do it , okay ! " i said , turning with determination , but he was n't there
[651/1000]	" we 'll just have to take it slow and avoid any distractions . i 'm already sick of being in the dark about so much . " " yeah ? what else do you know ? besides i
[652/1000]	" you said you wanted it . " she said when she could hold her breath no longer . the other children in the nursery were gone . " you said you wanted it . " " yes ,
[653/1000]	i 'm pretty sure i am better than pretty much anyone else here , but i do n't have the courage to say so to him . " we 'll be going now . " i smile down at
[654/1000]	" you say my name in such a nasty voice i can feel it in my body when i have n't seen you in years . i had hoped i could go unnoticed , " she said . " you
[655/1000]	" it 's just that ... " he shifted his gaze to ava . " i 'm not much of a ... man type . actually , i prefer to think of myself as the guy looking for hot women
[656/1000]	" what was the name that took you ? " i asked . he snorted . " my last name is jack , like the last name in the book . " he flipped through a few pages :
[657/1000]	" maybe it 's time for another one of that , " he decided . " if it 's from him . " the elevator doors glided open at its other end of the car . drake stepped out
[658/1000]	a glance at his watch stopped her from saying another word . she rose from her seat at the table . " i have to go . i 'm early . " " so am i. " the
[659/1000]	she laughed . " you 've probably never seen a clown here before . " " the ladies ' room is right across the street . " they entered a quiet , shaded hall , each couple staying
[660/1000]	" you guys are really quiet . " " i wanted to ask you something . " " okay . " i sat up and looked at him . he was lying against the headboard and was holding
[661/1000]	' i would n't have minded if you had , ' i said . ' with all the questions i have , and all you guys can do about it , you 've done a great job with the other
[662/1000]	" okay . " i tried not to sound too enthusiastic . i needed to keep my cool - even if some of what he said made his feelings on me sound bad . chapter eighteen the next
[663/1000]	but something about them frightened her more . and she felt strangely vulnerable , as if she did n't see right through them . the two men stood in front of her for a long moment . <EOS> almost
[664/1000]	" i know , i 'll take care of it . he 'll be fine . i 'll make him . " she watched as the cop walked away . " what exactly is it that you 're going
[665/1000]	but this was no ordinary city , no special place for humans ' true forms inside , which is how he 'd taken julie to his lair and shown her his ancient and ancient eyes tonight . he expected many
[666/1000]	" i do n't . why ? " " not so different from any other animal population . and you did n't believe me earlier . who was it that got into the house ? " " i
[667/1000]	* the lights would n't stay on for long and i wondered what the time was . when the tv started to show a movie about a town that had no citizens and just a couple of local news
[668/1000]	" yeah ! " she gave me a big hug . " can you believe it ? i 'm going to be married and have a few . " " what about your mother ? " " uh
[669/1000]	" of course not . " his face hardened . " you know of the black mist ? " " of course . " her smile was guarded . " i would n't be the first to feel
[670/1000]	i saw nothing but a faint glow through the window . this was a living room , not so different from the one i 'd been in the previous night back in ohio . a fireplace , a stereo ,
[671/1000]	" i 'll take care of everything , " the woman said . " i 'll be back before dark . if a problem arises , " the man said , a few steps ahead of rachel . "
[672/1000]	and that was that . " we 're in such a bad way . " " am i interrupting something important ? " he let out a harsh laugh and shook his head . " you 're
[673/1000]	" i miss my dad and mom , but they 're just so long gone . i ca n't believe it 's only been one day ... " he whispered , his breath fo gging the inside of his helmet
[674/1000]	then , her voice lowered and her body stilled in his arms . " oh my god , " she whispered . he turned his head and lifted his hands , pressing them to her face .
[675/1000]	the music changed , the crowd around us started singing louder . i heard gabe 's voice in my ear . " stay calm . nothing should hurt you . focus on your breathing . " his words
[676/1000]	" and you have a lot of friends . " " there is still an element to it . " " i figured as much . when are we taking this date to the next step ? "
[677/1000]	" was n't done , or how well done , " he said . " the way i know it , the queen 's going to say nothing . just give her the right answers , and leave them
[678/1000]	i put my arm around mom 's waist and she returned the gesture , but it was more a gesture of support and support for their child than an offer of support . mom could never hurt me in that
[679/1000]	' hello mrs coul th ard ' - the voice was in two languages - ' i 'll ring you back ; but first i need to talk to mrs randall . ' mrs coul th ard hesitated for
[680/1000]	the kid 's not talking - not only does he not appear to be listening to what she 's saying , but now he seems to have stopped doing anything whatsoever . instead he 's looking at her , and
[681/1000]	" thank you . i 'm grateful . if not for you , then for a miracle worker , " he said sincerely . he could n't stop talking about hope , which really seemed to make the situation
[682/1000]	" i do not have a better idea . " the guard looked out the window . " yes , the one of the prisoners . you 'll have to deliver him to the man in the room behind
[683/1000]	" do they really seem like the same ? " " maybe . she has a lot of good instincts when it comes to picking sides . " " i 'll say for yourself . " sean smiled
[684/1000]	what could i say ? i was his responsibility . like it or not , i had never done a thing to get him hurt . with that final thought , i spun around , and i was not
[685/1000]	she shook her head slowly , as if to clear it . " i think he did . remember the days my mother was in a car accident , <EOS> " the cold shot through her blood at
[686/1000]	i 'll have to do the same to his other half . and the alternative would be to bring in another criminal that was not mine . a few of the men surrounding me started talking to me again
[687/1000]	" i think it 's been a couple of days , " said the man . and then : " shit , i should have brought you something . you could wear this . " in what would be the
[688/1000]	" you 'll turn back to humanity and they 'll lose faith in each other , and that 's going to kill us , " replied the god of reason . " your faith is simply one more in a
[689/1000]	" i 'll have the car . " she smiled . " thanks . " i put my hand on her arm and stared at her , " now then , come on . " we made
[690/1000]	" i could not stop in time . a little more time than that and the men ran screaming . " the man thought he was leaving for real now and for the first time in forever . had there
[691/1000]	he could feel the man 's tension emanating from him . gabriel had more on his mind than he understood , because when they had arrived and found the house empty , he had searched their minds to determine what
[692/1000]	" i 'm so glad he did n't ... " he said , with a look of fear in his eyes . " i do n't know how he does it . " " stop it right there .
[693/1000]	" sure , i 'll take you home if you want . " i stare at the ground for a few seconds before looking up at josh . he gives me a sheepish smile . " i 'm sorry
[694/1000]	i 've known this man for years . ever since i found out he was my husband . i 'm sure you know his name is pete , right ? he was the guy who held me on the table
[695/1000]	he just kept talking , then . " as soon as you 've told the story . " " i do n't want to talk about it . " she tried to push herself up . it took
[696/1000]	we leave the van in the parking lot and begin to hike . ' okay , what 's your plan now ? ' she asks as we reach the tree - lined path . ' i do n't
[697/1000]	it was about six o'clock when my cell phone rang . i grabbed it and punched in the number i had memorized from my day at the gym . " do n't , " christian said , sounding far
[698/1000]	it was the same scenario , all the same . " we will only ever wish to be with you , your majesty , as you desire us to be . " her majesty shot off her couch ,
[699/1000]	as he turned a corner , she saw the sign for the hotel ahead . an expansive canopy canopy covered in flowers held a massive canopy that spread its leafy branches like some giant fan . a few shops at
[700/1000]	she looked up at me and blinked . behind her , i could see the sun had begun to set behind the mountains , and the shadows were beginning to slip into shade . " i ... do n't
[701/1000]	oh , she liked and respected this place , but it was just some place in scotland . it did n't have enough buildings for all the people . and she knew her home felt isolated from most other
[702/1000]	she frowned , looking back at her camera 's equipment to see if they 'd found anything . " hmm , " she said again , sounding worried . and yes , there was the answer ! a large block
[703/1000]	" he 's fine . you need to make love to me , sophia . i want you to know because you 're just a sex toy to me , " he said . " i thought i was
[704/1000]	" no ! " i turned to her , tears streaming at the mere sight of her face smeared with blood . " how could you do that to her ? " " when i went to check on
[705/1000]	her mom was the same way . did n't get to see the real her that far up ? this was n't a challenge , was n't a joke . it was just a matter of time . mom had
[706/1000]	" but it 's safe , right ? and i already told my parents . " " it 's safe , and it 's ... well , it 's a fortress , and i do n't think they would
[707/1000]	before the sound of the engine died away , he walked to the bank of elevators with david . several nurses and nurses eyed him , but he continued toward the glass doors . he stopped halfway there before a
[708/1000]	" oh . " i did n't expect him to turn around and stare at me , so i was unprepared when he moved his body right on in front of mine . good , because i was in
[709/1000]	" here 's the thing , " he said . " with you , anything is possible , even a small thing like being your own doctor , and even in a place like this ... " he pointed above
[710/1000]	i 'd started dating rick a couple of months after our separation . he 'd been wonderful to me and i 'd enjoyed my time with him . it was hard to believe that we 'd only been together for
[711/1000]	i could just wait and see if i could find information here . " this is the best lead in two days ! " my phone buzzed in my pocket , as i was halfway to calling jack
[712/1000]	or was it a secret ? and if so , would it hold me ? the question lingered in my mind for several moments before taking the plunge . how could i know so much about a guy who
[713/1000]	" i am certain ? " he said , as if insulted . " you 're not ? no one told me . " " you 're the most contrary woman i know . " how much
[714/1000]	" there 's no way i 'm going in there with you right now . " " it would be better for both of us if you did . " i look away , my stomach churning . i
[715/1000]	what has happened ? " " she got the wrong person . " " how come ? " " how do you think ? " of course she 'd get wrong people , he thought .
[716/1000]	he sat patiently . " do you have a list ? " said mrs. jones . " what of it ? " said tiffany . the shopkeeper shook a tiny packet off the counter and passed it
[717/1000]	" what . a phone call to the fbi ? without a phone call to my mom . " " you can trust her . there had to have been a reason for it . " " she
[718/1000]	my heart leapt into my throat . " there are a few who are willing to put a wager on us if you are willing , " his jaw clenched and his eyes narrowed . " i 'm only
[719/1000]	the next day , all was silent on your end of town . i called the local local cop and asked him to look into the incident . at the time , i thought it could have been an accident
[720/1000]	i ca n't understand it . my heart , of all the things he 's done in the past , is all about love . he kisses the top of my head as he steps away . " i
[721/1000]	" all right , i did it . " the question was why ? why would alex let him lose so easily ? chapter seven alex a few hours later alex dropped me off . thankfully
[722/1000]	" what ? " " the police . i ca n't deal with them right now . " i pulled his foot back and squeezed . " i 'm sorry . " " i 'm sorry , too
[723/1000]	" why ? what 's the matter ? " he tried to stop me but i did n't budge . " you 're being so mean again - well , your parents , maybe , but other than that you
[724/1000]	" yes ! well , nothing about the whole incident is normal , either . i mean , it was just that i ca n't seem to get out here , that 's all . maybe it 's the lack
[725/1000]	" because i believe that i found us a place to live , " she said . " in town , out of town ... at least , i believe i found a reason to stay here . " and
[726/1000]	there was a knock on the door , and before he could answer it said , " excuse me , can i come in ? " he had never thought through the implications of her visit , and the
[727/1000]	he smiled , and then he winked at me . " i 'm well aware of the kind of guy you are . " the first time i went out with jonathan , i had started to think he
[728/1000]	" let 's send them our love , " she said wistfully . " you boys are such good kids . i ca n't wait to see their faces when you all get married . you 'll have me
[729/1000]	" and we get these ? " i pointed at the four other items the professor had put together , including a vial , a small book of matches , and an amp ou le of holy water in my
[730/1000]	i turned to him . " then why ? " he sighed , " i do n't know . " i raised a brow . " yeah , you did n't expect me to go to the party
[731/1000]	" you might find that one of my new books is full of a story about the last night the great wolf attacked a young girl . it was about a boy , that was me . " "
[732/1000]	' no reason you ca n't , captain . we have less than five minutes alone . ' i nodded . ' i know . we need this . we need not have to fight . we lose .
[733/1000]	" i was just wondering about the man who made a pass at you in the hall . " " what ? yeah ? the guy who got hit by a car ? " she grinned as she pushed
[734/1000]	" that 's right , " he said . he took my hand and shook it . " see you tomorrow then . " " wait . " i pulled my hand away from him . " i need
[735/1000]	he made a face of disgust as he dug deeper . " yeah well , this is the one he does n't like . i heard that one , and i hope you got some good looks to take with
[736/1000]	" okay , " i said , and kept following him , although i still felt as though i had lost my way . we were walking again , just on the other side of town . this was the
[737/1000]	she stepped out . she could feel the wind 's coolness as it ruffled her hair and she could n't stop the smile from spreading from the corners of her mouth . she could n't help but notice the few
[738/1000]	" my daughter 's fine . " a lie ! my finger jabbed at the end of my list . " then why do you - " " there 's nothing to know about her . go .
[739/1000]	" but if you 're an angel then he 's just going to ignore your warnings , " i said in a whiny girl voice . chase took my hand and led me to the bed . " of
[740/1000]	" this is beautiful , " melissa said admiringly . " it 's just up for sale in the high - rise , " archie said . " so do you want to get her the house ?
[741/1000]	" see what i mean ? " said miss tick , and she did . " does that mean , that it ca n't be ? " said tiffany , leaning forward . " that can mean ... well
[742/1000]	" do you speak english ? " i asked him . " i saw a tattoo on your back . " he leaned close to me , his lips tickling my cheek . " yes . " "
[743/1000]	i looked up into the face of my father . " i am sorry ... i was only going to say you could tell jack that i 'll be good to him . " he held my shoulders
[744/1000]	" i trust you . " " so do i. " " you can trust me , " he says . " there 's no need to give me a reason to . " i do n't
[745/1000]	" yeah , i 'll be here until six . " she said . " then how about if i meet you there ? " i asked . " ok , " she said and walked away .
[746/1000]	" she does n't . you were right , " he murmurs , and my nipples harden . he leans down , kissing my cheek , and once more , his hand travels up my belly . " i
[747/1000]	when i got to school i walked straight to my locker , opened the bottom drawer and grabbed some books . inside were the new notebooks and a second set of papers and a book . when i sat on
[748/1000]	" oh , of course , " the little woman returned with a chuckle . " it 's wonderful to have you here , miss . i have a small store in town , but i need an introduction .
[749/1000]	" we 've got to go shopping later , " she says , and i have to bite back a gasp . her pretty little hand brushes up against my arm , almost taking my breath away , so sure
[750/1000]	" what ? " " the door ! " she said quickly . " the door that has n't broken in years ! " sarah looked through the peep hole and saw something that only her eyes could see
[751/1000]	the rest of the day was spent in the local grocery store , paying local boys ' attention to their problems and trying to not act like they had been caught doing something they should n't have done . unfortunately
[752/1000]	" well , what do you want ? " " to be with you . " she gasped , her eyes darting to the dark path ahead of her . she was n't surprised to find gabriel striding
[753/1000]	" i 'm going to go get my things , then i 'll be back . you guys stay here tight . " she nodded and followed him . hunter returned a few minutes later , bringing with
[754/1000]	it was a huge hit . only eight by nine hundred were left : the seven men , the six women and one of them was now a full - scale attack . we opened fire on them
[755/1000]	" wait , is it some kind of joke that you want to f * * k me ? " she pulled away from him . why did he want her to ? why was it so important to her
[756/1000]	" you got a problem with that ? " she demanded crossly before she closed the door . i got the feeling that if i were in her shoes , i 'd get the exact same reaction . she loved
[757/1000]	i did n't know if that was a valid concern - or a small warning sign of things to come . i was alone on the road , still waiting for the wheels to move , not knowing where
[758/1000]	" she 's coming , " cole whispered . " run , robin . run into the woods , toward the house . i 'll cover you . " she managed to pull her eyes open , and cole
[759/1000]	" yes . " i shook my head and sat down on the edge of the lounger . " i 'm sorry , we did n't mean to pry . " they looked back down at me , but i
[760/1000]	my heart raced in my chest . his lips hovered over mine for a moment , and it felt like a lifetime to have his kiss on my skin , but when he pulled back , he whispered , "
[761/1000]	" we have no weapons . we have nothing to offer a mortal . " <EOS> - nothing lost a hole in his bed , the way i did and the only ones who had fought with our enemies
[762/1000]	" hey , " he said , staring at where a small number of them were standing on the sidewalk near the hotel , " the sun 's going down . go ahead and see for yourself . "
[763/1000]	" this morning , i had dinner with a friend and her husband . " " oh ! and the next day ? " alexandra grinned . " yes , and the next day . " the
[764/1000]	the crowd did n't stand and ovation . the police were right behind them . the crowd had no chance . the three officers who took them into custody were forced to stand up , be watched , and they
[765/1000]	" that is n't the only reason , " she countered with a soft laugh . " and there 's more . " " more about the girls ? " a suspicion gripped him . " did you and
[766/1000]	ethan walked away from me . the moment we started talking about the sex , i was going to tell him . hell , if he knew the reason and he still did n't like it , it would ruin
[767/1000]	" very well , " replied mr. marlin . " for example , we all know i was the last of the great wizard wizards of the age of the thirteen , when you were only just three years old
[768/1000]	" oh my sweet lord , yes , that is how i feel about marriage . do n't you realize that ? i want to marry you . and i do n't even want the wedding . i just want
[769/1000]	my heart sped up , and i almost felt claustrophobic in " tiny - time travel " mode . some type of black and white scene appeared up ahead , and i squinted . there was not a single word
[770/1000]	' i am no angel , ' he muttered to himself . ' that can not be so . none of you are . ' justus sat forward . ' what ? ' ver yan 's grip
[771/1000]	" no , it 's not something you would want to talk about . i can think of one way to turn it off , " he said . " it would n't be a good one , jack
[772/1000]	" you really like it . " he looked into her eyes and she was sure he could see the truth . " what ? do you think i 'm a guy who can take a blow job
[773/1000]	" yes . that night when she woke , disoriented , she looked over at noah wearing her pajamas , then back at her clothes , as if to say , " i do n't know what 's wrong
[774/1000]	without thinking , i pick up my phone in the kitchen and text rex . i miss you his response comes next words surprising me . me too after two months , rex is the
[775/1000]	" you and i will be together , but not in bed , " she said and gave him one hug . " you will be with me , and only with me , and it will all work out
[776/1000]	all of that meant nothing when it came to the last thing she wanted to face . if she went into town , the last thing she wanted to face was anyone else . as it turned out ,
[777/1000]	" is it my fault you were attacked by these people ? " luke asked again . " no , " arianna replied . " he left me behind . it was too dangerous . i was trying to
[778/1000]	" no , " she said , taking my hand . i squeezed it . despite this morning 's insanity , i 'd hoped she would call me one day . i was scared i would n't be able to
[779/1000]	the two boys pulled on their clothes and said their goodbyes . when they were alone , jonathan motioned to jonathan to lead the way . kevin walked away , not bothering to watch jonathan and candi go .
[780/1000]	" let 's go . " two minutes later we stood in the parking lot outside the parking garage . the parking garage was a little too large for me and i felt like i was getting a giant
[781/1000]	" you look just like a boy , " the dark haired woman whispered . a pair of men walked past my table , and i grabbed the woman 's hand when they crossed behind it and steered her
[782/1000]	" not this time . see how the pain is returning . what i want you to focus that on is how alive the body feels . that 's what i want you to concentrate on . you need to
[783/1000]	" my god , would you like to help ? " " i have some things i have in mind , " i confessed . it was worth a try . i watched her for a moment as she
[784/1000]	" she 's not so bad . " hunter turned his head to look at jim . " jim , is n't she a good shot ? " " of course she is . what do you mean
[785/1000]	" very good . i 'm glad to hear it . does that mean you have it ? " " i do . " " what do you want to call it ? " " what do
[786/1000]	he left me in the bathroom and went back to bed moments later to take up his vigil . i stared at the ceiling . then i whispered , " you really think this is good ? "
[787/1000]	" so let 's hear it . " zane answered immediately , looking at her as if he needed her approval . " how did you know where a bar was ? " " i do n't . i
[788/1000]	' perhaps we may have a different problem . ' patroclus raised his voice and bellowed , ' he 's about to go up on the roof with him ! ' atreus looked towards the face of the first
[789/1000]	and i would know how . i 'd been to his place before . i knew all about how bad things got when people died - how much they hurt , how little they mattered . but these were different
[790/1000]	" they did n't find any , " sam told her . " they should get help soon . " kenton had to press a wet washcloth to her forehead . lora 's pupils had narrowed , the blue
[791/1000]	" i do not recognize this boy , but i assume the king has told him everything . we have information , but whatever that information is we will need to keep our heads down and get rid of the
[792/1000]	" you must make it to your parents <EOS> your room ... you go out to the garage , home with shopping . and as a cat , i like to climb the stairs if you live on the mountain
[793/1000]	" right , " says peeta . he seems so calm about it all , as if it were no big deal to ask what makes it special . " i 'm just hoping we can afford it someday
[794/1000]	and just then the roar of the surf poured out into the open on some distant ocean shore . the captain turned at the sound , his eyebrows high , and glanced around , until his own gaze landed
[795/1000]	jack made eye contact with her . " i knew it was coming . " he gestured toward the door . " get out . i 've had enough . everyone else do n't you think we have enough to
[796/1000]	' when will you go ? ' i asked , giving him a quick hug . he shrugged , with a rueful grin . ' i do n't know . ' ' look ! ' a woman appeared
[797/1000]	" what did he even do ? " one lady hissed . the vampire came closer . " would you like to tell me ? " her attention returned to the lady . she was pretty , of
[798/1000]	" yes , i do . " " you do ? then why do you have to come here all the time ? i figured you 'd have better things to do . " he shrugged . "
[799/1000]	a sound <EOS> , a deep , smooth chuckle , and then one long and guttural cry that changed into a sharp squeal . " i know , " he said . " it 's okay . i 'm scared
[800/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " " i do n't have a problem with this kind of attention . i get the gist of what i have to do but i do n't know what i 'm going to
[801/1000]	<EOS> i looked up , my body arching against the body of the man standing behind me , the light pressing against my chest and back . " i get that you 're drunk and <EOS> , if you
[802/1000]	" i do n't see how that makes anything hurt my feelings , " olivia grumbled . " oh really ? what do you think hurts them ? " dillon asked , his voice calm . she rolled
[803/1000]	" was this your idea of a joke ? " " i could n't be more wrong , sir . " he offered a quick salute , then returned for an inspection , muttering , " sir like an
[804/1000]	" but not in an actual sense , " she said <EOS> very much , holding one - " i did , not just in terms . yes , i have always seen the difference between being a big project
[805/1000]	there was more , one more detail , but i had to hold it in . maybe i could avoid him forever if i spent it in a place that would n't cause a storm of emotions . "
[806/1000]	her parents . she could hear them in her head , laughing through the phone . why did n't they understand ? at least they knew she was dying . there were so many other people in her life
[807/1000]	" how long has he been so determined to play her ? " " not long . he 's been sleeping with her a lot lately too . " " he says she is his mistress . "
[808/1000]	" i am , " she said . " right now , the only thing i 'm willing to do is stand here and yell at everyone to leave me alone . " he swallowed . how easy it
[809/1000]	" we 're a different species with a different system , " she explained . " we have not always been the same , but we are different because of the same characteristics . different blood , different sex ,
[810/1000]	he lifted one hand to her face , cupping her cheek . " <EOS> even the worst of it . how long have you known ? " she stared up at him . " i 'll give you
[811/1000]	" the others can handle it . " his brother nodded . " we are , " he said again . " you 're all right with this ? " asked riyan . " yeah , riyan
[812/1000]	his voice was low in his throat , a rasp that surprised me . " do you feel it ? " i shrugged a shoulder . the sensation was almost like another physical sensation . " it
[813/1000]	" i 'll make you wish for an even more horrible moment than the one you were in the hospital with . " " we ca n't go through this again , " anne said , a hint of
[814/1000]	" you do n't think it 's possible that i just took over the house , do you ? " she asked . " maybe you saw me do it that one time . " " i did n't
[815/1000]	" i thought you wanted to stay here ? " i said . " my dad 's making me move into his place , and things are moving too fast . i do n't even have my house ...
[816/1000]	" we do n't . " " and because we say so , we wo n't . " i 've never been more right - minded in my life . i 've always known it . and now
[817/1000]	* * * a long time later , when the nurse came in looking for meg , simon felt a rush of anger toward not being available . he had come to make sure she was well cared for
[818/1000]	the room was clean , as if it had just had its first meeting with the person who <EOS> whatever i 'd met all while still a little kid . " what 's going on ? are you sure
[819/1000]	" no , it 's okay , i 'll write later . " i have n't even seen the word " love " yet , but even if i did , that does n't mean i am being an immature
[820/1000]	" is that always another source of excitement in the underworld , " said a voice at the back of the room . a girl 's voice . " yes , but we do n't have much time .
[821/1000]	he looked over his shoulder at her as she continued to stare out at the water and try to ignore the fact that even though he was not speaking , julie was afraid she 'd just set herself up for
[822/1000]	the light was dimming in the afternoon , so the porch was pitch black . i got off the bench in front of the street lamp , then started down the sidewalk . i saw the shadow of a person
[823/1000]	" really ? great . i 'm glad . " jack stood against the corner and folded his arms . " i am . what about you ? " " no . " he got that look on
[824/1000]	" and i think it was you i trusted more . " an hour later , i could n't get through to them in the lobby of the imperial - it was too crowded . as the night progressed
[825/1000]	" you heard the plan , man , " one said . " we need to move right now . " " what about the woman ? " the oldest one asked . " the girl , right
[826/1000]	" i think it would benefit us both to spend more time together , " he said softly . the words had a strange , low , guttural quality to them and caused a pang of sexual awareness that
[827/1000]	" yeah . because it would be so much easier . " he opened the door for me . i stepped out through the sliding door as he pulled it shut . our feet crunched across the gravel .
[828/1000]	" we 'll talk in the morning . i 'm not sure there 's anything you can do but be patient , okay ? " he paused , taking a long swig of his coffee and then asked , "
[829/1000]	" yes , i remember her ; she did this for me right in the very middle of the wedding , and , i remembered that , " replied mr. he wes , as he and isabel finally made eye
[830/1000]	" i do n't have time . " she sat up . " get out ! i ca n't see anything out here but fog . i do n't even know why we 're out here ! " "
[831/1000]	" is something wrong ? " her eyes locked on his , and he knew what it was . " no . nothing 's wrong . " garrett tried to sound cheerful , but he could n't quite manage
[832/1000]	alex , i need you to focus this whole thing on someone else . focus on him and not me . and do n't worry ; everyone thinks you 're a total geek . " " i 'm so
[833/1000]	i looked back to the bar to see what i could see . " it 's just that there are a lot of people here with me the night of the fire . " " sounds like it 's
[834/1000]	" it 's a large room , a very large room , and i am in a dark room ... " something large and black passed by us on the floor . " listen , you two ,
[835/1000]	" you have . i do n't want to leave . we should wait for the rest of the class to finish and then you can get home . " " really ? " she looked less than thrilled
[836/1000]	" i saw his face , " i told her . " he had a bruise . " " not that . he 's trying to talk to them . i think i got them drugged . "
[837/1000]	" but you remember telling me a long time ago that i 'm special ? " her voice was quiet , but soft . " you are special , caleb . you see the way my grandfather is watching you
[838/1000]	" i did n't say that , " i told him . " you have n't seen what happened in here . who 's that guy you were telling me about ? " " that 's jeb , "
[839/1000]	" it 's very rare but i think it can be found over there . " " do you know what size of a gun it is ? " " no . " " it looks ,
[840/1000]	' a what , a man ? you 're a clown ? you 're an clown ? is that what you are ? ' ' no , ' said miss level . that 's what you 're ,
[841/1000]	" get the f * * k away from her . " " i am . i did n't even realize he was right <EOS> f * * king there . " " i f * * king
[842/1000]	it was a lie ; you did n't sit through movies and movies like we did . where was the excitement when a film turned out so right ? when the heroine read the lines and took her spot ,
[843/1000]	" and to ask my boy and his wife to join our party in this place . " he shook his head <EOS> to self , from his younger joy . had they , though the sheer mischief , or
[844/1000]	she lifted her hands and laid them on his chest over the heart she was sure he worked so hard to keep beating . " we were just talking about that . " " and you know why ?
[845/1000]	" it 's so beautiful , like it was made for you , i 'm sure , " she smiled . i glanced over at her as she was looking out at a field on the other side of
[846/1000]	" did n't we have a plan ? " " you plan on sleeping with me , right ? " he asked , taking my hands in his . " but i 'm ready to start making this work
[847/1000]	her voice was warm and sweet . " i 'll bet you have . " a wicked glint entered her eyes . " you do n't always have to worry about being seen . " " i 'm not
[848/1000]	" i suppose you 'll have to explain the whole thing when i get home , " he said , smiling . she shrugged . " no more than you did last night . " she hoped .
[849/1000]	" good luck , son , we 'll see you soon . " " what else is new ? " a big grin spread across dad 's face as i nodded into the phone . i wanted to
[850/1000]	" i just got everything ready to go , " i assured them , " and some supplies . " " great , " mrs. johnson cut in , letting the sarcasm slip in the word . " now
[851/1000]	" i 'm fine . " " then why do you have to go to the trouble and pain of feeding a predator . " " food 's great , " i said , and swallowed .
[852/1000]	" they 're all here , " i said , pointing towards the group that had swarmed to give the warning . " i do n't think they have any idea who we are . " " i
[853/1000]	" i think i can . " " good , that means you should know what you 're getting into . it 'll take a lot more experience than you think to get into this . " but the
[854/1000]	the soldier paused as he turned his head to scan her face . there was concern and wonder mingled on his face . then , with a slow and subtle nod , he stepped away and headed down the tunnel
[855/1000]	" and what will you do about the council ? " " i do n't care , " i said without thinking . " i 'll figure out a way for you to leave . " he let
[856/1000]	" where 's mr. wil ly wa gs ? " asked jake . " he 's in the hospital holding hands with dr soames . " " so you saw jake when i was already there ? "
[857/1000]	" yeah , " he answered . she took a sip of her coffee and was surprised at what was beginning to stir in her when he added , " so , it is n't you or me .
[858/1000]	" <EOS> ' t would leave me no doubt . it is a shame that the others have shown their face . " " that reminds me ! i got two letters . did n't you ? "
[859/1000]	" i do not care . just in mind , when i come back , " said jack . " be ready to leave . " the soldiers returned to their formation and the soldiers in the front ran
[860/1000]	" just going to put it on , " he said , making my throat tighten . i was suddenly overwhelmed by a twinge of pain from the thought of anyone else seeing it . " here . "
[861/1000]	" what about the red stuff ? " i asked . " yeah , i read lots of books about it , but i 'm sorry to say you 're right . i 'm really not much for the
[862/1000]	" maybe i just did n't get up to the office enough for you , " he says with a wink . his blue eyes crinkle at the edges , and i have to force myself not to lose my
[863/1000]	" she 's not my wife . " the man gave him another quick scan then took a drink . " she is and she is n't . i just figured it was n't worth giving you anymore .
[864/1000]	she could hear the laughter in his voice . she wanted to say something , to tell him she 'd been feeling less than stellar lately , but it would be pointless . when the music ended and the
[865/1000]	she looked up . " what ? " " do you remember last night when we took you to dinner and i said i wanted to do our dishes ? i was all over you , baby , and
[866/1000]	" but i 'm not a werewolf . i am more human than wolf . i can move objects with my mind . i can change shapes . i know what i am . i am a shape shifter .
[867/1000]	" yeah , " she answered before taking a long pull , letting the alcohol settle in . " that 's right . i 'm pregnant . " " pregnant ? " " yeah , with your child
[868/1000]	she sighed softly in relief . " of course you did . " " my mother passed away before i was born . we had a lot of problems . " " i 'm sorry , " she
[869/1000]	" only you , " the girl echoed . " he 's the only one i know who hates you . there 's no one else like you to get revenge . it 's evil of you . it wo
[870/1000]	she knew he was n't doing it for her , he was doing it for herself . " you went out this morning ? " he asked , and when she nodded and looked away , he said ,
[871/1000]	" so you never saw something that meant anything to you ? do you know what i am ? " a chill trickled down the back of her neck . she did n't have time to ponder on that
[872/1000]	" well , i still have a question for you . you know , when we first met , the things that you said that make me want to throw something at you . " " yeah ? "
[873/1000]	" do you need me to give you any help ? " he shakes his head and frowns . it 's a sign of stress i 'm not sure what to do or how to fix . " will
[874/1000]	" a fine place indeed , " said lady maccon , standing over her bed , trying to coax her hair back into a semblance of a proper back - to - shoulder queue . " in fact , i
[875/1000]	' i see . ' she tried to smile , but it did n't reach her eyes . ' well , you did say you had a confession to make ? ' ' i did . '
[876/1000]	" no , he did n't . but if you want him back , you should ask him . " they left the house early morning . * * * to see alex ? the thought made
[877/1000]	" what makes you think that ? " " because i smell the bastard on you . you do n't need to tell me who we 're dealing with , not with that f * * ker around .
[878/1000]	" no , " she spat out in a low growl against his skin as she tried to hold him inside of her . his response was immediate as he buried his face in her neck . his mouth
[879/1000]	what else did you do ? ' ' anything but complain . i was very tired and just wanted to sleep . ' ' i am sorry about the trouble you had trying to get to school this
[880/1000]	" because we 're human , " a familiar , sweet voice said , " and humans often prefer humans to create whatever it takes to get what they want . " " ah , a bit different ,
[881/1000]	" you bet ! " she could n't believe this was happening - had been thinking that maybe this would turn into her lifetime of glory , a quest to save her father . they 'd talked about coming back
[882/1000]	" yes , " she mumbled and my head came up . " you need a break . why do n't you take a break for me ? " for some reason , that took me off guard
[883/1000]	finally , at the foot of the steps , he paused , unable to continue indefinitely . but it was n't until he heard the squeak of boots on the steps that he turned toward that voice . and when
[884/1000]	" do n't you get it ? i told you , yes , she 's my friend , but she 's my friend and she 's coming from me , from us . " " really ! " my
[885/1000]	" why in the world would an island fall for a monster ? " the boy asked . " i do n't know . " jack shrugged . " maybe because the monster is the only animal that ca
[886/1000]	" i know what you 're thinking . i 'm being punished for doing no . " paul pointed at his chest . " i heard what you did . i 'm not interested . " paul shook
[887/1000]	he looks back down as if all this has happened . " you have the best body i 've ever had . even better than i remember . " i roll my eyes at his self - deprecating phrase
[888/1000]	" good , it 's great so far . the police wo n't speak to it though . a big hassle just got done . so , the fire is ... " " yes ... yes , i 'm
[889/1000]	" where did he <EOS> he fell into the story ? " " he got a job . finally going off on some adventure . " he went on . " that was his favorite movie . he called
[890/1000]	" thanks ! " i exclaimed , rubbing my face . " did n't i knock you out ? " i turned to look at him . he grinned , but he was n't ready to talk yet .
[891/1000]	" fuck ! fuck ! " he screamed , as his hands fumbled with the zipper . i could hear his bones popping and he groaned . he was on the brink of a release . " oh my
[892/1000]	the look in his eyes was so terrifying to see , that she could barely breathe . his mouth was set in a hard line and his shoulders were rigid . rage , maybe , or hatred ? the
[893/1000]	" oh . " her gaze dropped to his still raging arousal . " so , a first date ? " she said teasingly . " maybe you told me you were a virgin . " nate choked
[894/1000]	" i guess you would , and maybe you could use some help out there . there might be some people i can call off for a few days , but you might need some help out there . with
[895/1000]	" here , " she said . " i 'll help you sit . " he accepted her extra help with the stretcher , not liking the sound of it . she had always been strong , but still
[896/1000]	he pulled the black hood of his cloak over his head , concealing his face . he waited to see what she would do and a few seconds later , she removed her arm , lowering it to her side
[897/1000]	" it is , i suppose . " as it was , it was the only one of your clients that was out of the question . " " we are , of course , in no hurry ,
[898/1000]	the black sedan parked across the road on the other side of the road . a couple of people stepped out of the vehicle , carrying coffee cups while another driver strolled forward , holding a camera . all of
[899/1000]	" what the hell ? " the words fell from her mouth like a dirty joke . " you met your maker . you owe all you have to him . " " no i do n't -
[900/1000]	" this one 's a bit of an a hi ck , is n't it ? " said fat charlie . " you see the side with the yellow stripes on it ? " she nodded . "
[901/1000]	" would you not have put yourself in harm 's way ? " that was true . it had . " they did not choose me out of all anyone , and that must have been true with
[902/1000]	" we used to be too nice , when we were kids , we used to sneak in like we were , " i said quickly . " we did n't have anyone to tell us when those bastards came
[903/1000]	" yes , but mostly , i know you love to play your jokes well and you 're going to finish high school if it 's not too much trouble . " i laugh , then shake my head

[906/1000]	that one had the worst timing in the world . then again , maybe he was only interested in the case . all that talk about a killer " having " over them was just getting old .
[907/1000]	the crowd slowly dispersed , so that the new student 's hands were free to move . " okay , " she said , " i guess we ca n't just stand here and wait for the next person
[908/1000]	' and you met him ? ' ' oh yes , it was quite sudden . we met in paris that first time . ' ' how nice . how unusual ? ' ' why ? '
[909/1000]	" i do n't really know , " i said , my voice more than a little shaky . " he ... he said it might have fallen and some kind of bird flew inside the car and ate his
[910/1000]	" good man . no more mistakes . i am too bad about that . that one will go down in history . " " i am too good ? " " uh huh . you were n't
[911/1000]	i shook my head . i do n't care if that 's what it meant - i do n't care if it made her feel better to know that she was so alone , that she was out there in
[912/1000]	" this is where you should start keeping a journal . " the man pointed to a wall on the left and right . " these are the journals of men you 've taken <EOS> in a way . "
[913/1000]	" um " - rachel looked back and forth between them - " that would be a no . " " yes , it would . i want you . you 'd be welcome here anytime . "
[914/1000]	" come here , " she whispered softly . " i need to hold you . all right ? " i lifted her up onto the kitchen counter with her legs circled around me and lifted her back over
[915/1000]	" i will find you . if i ever see you again , " he growled softly , his arms tightening around me . i clung tightly to him , holding on as he slowly withdrew from my body
[916/1000]	this sounded disturbingly like a very bad thing . " i am sorry , mrs. lincoln , " mr. solomon said with a genuine smile . you 'd think he was just trying to help . " how did
[917/1000]	the guy had a right to know what had happened . he was the alpha . the other bastard did n't want to know the truth . hell , they all wanted to know . if drake knew
[918/1000]	he kept his voice gentle as he asked , " you okay ? " she nodded . " fine , but i do n't think i 'm going to be able to walk this afternoon . i do n't
[919/1000]	his jaw clenched and his eyes darkened . i could tell without looking . " do not think so , minx . be glad you 're not here when the men arrive . it would be an act of debauchery
[920/1000]	" yeah . tell me about it , " i moan . we fall , panting , into each other , and he wraps his arms around me , pulling me flush against his body . i take a
[921/1000]	no . no . no . none of this . you ca n't live like this , you ca n't pretend you just died and changed your life . you 're going to get sick . you are going to
[922/1000]	" it 's amazing how much energy we generate . but you really need to leave it in the car . i 'll go get it . there 's a bunch of things i need to do before i can
[923/1000]	well , hell , so was everyone else at the wedding . so much for the small party of " friends " and coworkers who had n't forgotten about the party . that left only zach and zach and her
[924/1000]	" no one said you were a monk , " i say . " yes i am . i mean , i am . " <EOS> but the way he had run to something . he stands up
[925/1000]	she pulled the door open , expecting to see a familiar face sitting up in bed . instead the room was empty . just the bed . where was she ? a deep , rumbling murmur emerged from somewhere
[926/1000]	" not necessary . ' " come to town . " " when ? " she shrugs . " tomorrow or tonight . " " when ? " " as soon as possible . "
[927/1000]	' i 'll take that as a no ? ' she said . ' er , actually , i might have been in a bit of a mood tonight , your grace , ' she said , smoothing back the
[928/1000]	" you told me you could n't do it , and now that you are , what do you want me to do ? " " what you always do when you want to just go away . "

[930/1000]	" this does n't mean he 's in your league . i do n't know why the hell he 'd try to go the other way , but he 's very determined . he knows what he has to do
[931/1000]	" the same . " " where 's the guy ? " the guy said . " i do n't remember , " reacher said . " i do n't think he was with me . "
[932/1000]	the men moved onto the road , following the black , glowing body that moved as if it were running in the gloom . the night air was damp and chill . " that 's from the spirit of a
[933/1000]	i tried to stop it . my parents were important people , and so were my friends , but they had to make decisions together now that things were different . i was determined to give them the time they

[935/1000]	" it 's because the man you knew can make you feel like shit in ten times the time . " i 'm losing myself in his eyes . now i ca n't pay attention to anything else .
[936/1000]	" i 'm not really sure . " matt laughed a little , feeling a little sheepish . " do you think it 's anything to be embarrassed about ? " he sounded a little bit interested .
[937/1000]	" i think we may have a problem , " i told her . " what kind of problem ? " " well , we know they 're on the back of the phone . right ? "
[938/1000]	the only time she ever took time off was once or twice a month . it was when she was under the influence of ... something . " i was only being friendly , " she said in an
[939/1000]	" no , " said the priest slowly , " we have not found evidence of anything untoward near by . " " nonsense , brother " said the young man . " we have left nothing unexplained close
[940/1000]	" where did you guys find this ? " " it 's not in a box . if i thought it was , i would n't have dragged it out for you . it 's actually under a large
[941/1000]	i took a deep breath and then replied , " okay . that 's all i 'm gon na say about it . " luke stayed silent . he was n't wrong . i got up at
[942/1000]	" i would have changed things long ago , " he muttered under his breath . the young man shrugged and ran inside . " come back to me , " i whispered , lifting up on my elbow
[943/1000]	" so what should i do ? " i ask , trying to stifle the sob that threatens to spew from my throat . " about what ? " " about everything . mom and dad , your
[944/1000]	" the thought of trying to get alone with her is n't cool . it 'll be a real hassle on both our parts . " " neither is the memory of what you said earlier , " she
[945/1000]	" with the way these guys talk , i 've got ta do my homework . " " let 's talk later , " she said with a flirty smile , leaning into him with her arms linked behind
[946/1000]	" no , do n't be silly , " she said , " i 'm afraid we ca n't perform a ceremony without your permission . " " my permission ? " " you and i have not
[947/1000]	" i 'm sorry , mr. smith . " the woman reached out to touch the back of jennifer 's hand , but jennifer winced away . " go back to your car , and put a sock on it
[948/1000]	her jaw was clenched <EOS> damn the long grass , she would be terrified . then again , though there had been only that little bit of anxiety , there were some things she had gotten used to , with
[949/1000]	" what do you think ? " i ask . she runs the mascara wand over each of my collar bones , lingering over the sensitive skin there . " you are beautiful . " she knows me
[950/1000]	" ok , so , you want me to ask mrs. everett to make a little of your breakfast ? you could do that on mom 's other side . or what if she really does n't like cereal so
[951/1000]	' i 've had it with your bla thering around , and it 's getting old . ' ' and why ? is it why you 're leaving ? ' she sighed heavily . ' okay . just
[952/1000]	she glanced around the dark , bare room . it was too small , and there was n't enough light . she looked at the man nearest her . he slept peacefully , but she felt sure he had
[953/1000]	i took the folder from him and opened it . he did n't wait for me to open it as he sat down at the nearby kitchen table with it . " what are you - " i started
[954/1000]	" you 're telling me , " said a new voice . claire whirled around to see steve standing on the other side of the door . " you 're scaring me , big guy . what are you
[955/1000]	' i could understand that bit , not the part where you said it was the only way inside without going through the doors ? ' tristram nodded . ' so you ca n't do that ? '
[956/1000]	" do n't talk like that , " emma reprimanded , and my heart sank a little . " i 'm just talking , em , " i insisted . " it 's okay . " she sighed
[957/1000]	the man looked at the crowd . " i 'm here as a representative and i wish to make myself sound more professional . i seem to be a little ... " he searched for a word . " ...
[958/1000]	do n't worry about it , but what i really meant was , when i started seeing the three of them , it was all part of my game . they did n't like it like the others did last
[959/1000]	" for the second time " he said . i shook my head in response . " i just realized something that i have never done . i never would have gone after that thing if it had not been
[960/1000]	" you can let it go . " that made me laugh . " no chance of that . it 's in there somewhere . " the driver and i got out of the car . the breeze
[961/1000]	she saw them in his eyes - the deep , dark green of the nile and the wide , empty gaze of an ar men ian sea . she saw the shadow of the man he really was when he
[962/1000]	" do you ever get bored of him , the guy who lives next door to me ? " " what is wrong with you ? " she spat out . " you should be glad he 's that good
[963/1000]	" no , i had a cousin who was named dan in the line of duty . we started walking around town together . once they found out he was going to keep keeping me in the shed , i
[964/1000]	" yes . " a simple nod . " i 'm so glad your friend 's safe . i miss him so much . " " he was lucky to have you , " i assured her .
[965/1000]	he had never felt so helpless . the thought was sickening . " you are correct . the question remains , why should i not give it to you ? " " is there some way to give
[966/1000]	she pulled her hand from his and looked into his eyes , looking them over . she could n't believe the heat that crawled through her and tightened her throat . " i do . " she closed her eyes
[967/1000]	" no , it makes no difference to me what she was living on in chicago . i was going to make my own way - i wanted to be a senator 's son . " he pointed at the
[968/1000]	" yes , " he said . " in the back . on the floor . " " how 'd you know if it was n't a gunshot ? " he shook his head . " i
[969/1000]	" i 'm getting through this fine . you and i can take a break from chasing each other and starting over . then we can deal with all our issues . " her words sounded like a promise
[970/1000]	" yeah , " he answered , his voice growing soft , i guess because i was there when it happened . " that 's great . " the sob was sliding down my throat and i was scared
[971/1000]	" that 's for the best , " she whispered . " do you want me to lie here and sleep ? " " no , i 'm not ready to go down there . i 'll be
[972/1000]	her gaze lifted and caught his . " you 're the one who has to decide , ben . it 's up to you . " and he decided right then that he liked her right there .
[973/1000]	" i 'm going to kill you . " hunter said on the intercom . " good . good ! do it anyway if you do n't want to be killed ! hunter , if anyone sees you with
[974/1000]	" what happened ? " " my god . . . can i have a moment ? " he took her hand and led her to a small , private room off the main living room . he locked
[975/1000]	" no , i 'm fine , " cassie replied with a dismissive wave at the paper . she 'd never been able to read anything from the first draft . " and yes , i used the full -
[976/1000]	" very nice . " " it 's never been new . the old is pretty old . " " really ? i thought if there were old i 'd be able to handle them . "
[977/1000]	" i know what happened , logan , " i say , stepping aside . " when you saved me . " he does n't deny it . he does n't say anything . " just go ,
[978/1000]	we 're safe , cassie . that 's all that matters . but then that image flickered back to the other day when he 'd heard the screaming ... and he 'd started remembering max 's death all over
[979/1000]	the rain was now a steady drizzle , and i was glad . i had no idea where to find a hotel or even a diner . i was still tired and exhausted from all the fighting . my body

[983/1000]	she closed her eyes for a moment and hoped the rain would stop . not that it would n't but until it did she would have one more thing to fear . what had happened to her brother was
[984/1000]	" how 'd you find out why we needed such a high - profile contract ? " rick asked . her chin tilted toward the ceiling . " i 've known for a few weeks , and had to
[985/1000]	if the cops were watching the truck , they were n't even looking there , and his wife so far was showing zero signs of interest in taking any trips in her own car . " does it really
[986/1000]	" with good reason . i 'm a lawyer , ms. taylor . i 'm not afraid to use my real name . " my arm was still around her shoulder , but i was no longer getting physical
[987/1000]	i did n't have time for an argument . i got up and yelled , my arms straight out ; i was facing away from him . he grabbed my hair , lifting and tossing my head back
[988/1000]	" with a little luck , " he finished for her . " that 's possible , " she allowed . " what are you wearing ? " he teased . " pants . " "
[989/1000]	his face changed as if he suddenly realized they were approaching the end of the street . ' no , ' he said . ' not here . not in the open . ' he had trouble looking directly at
[990/1000]	in my mind 's eye , i see her , she 's sitting there , wearing a tight white dress and black heels , reading something on her phone while sipping a glass of wine and laughing to herself .
[991/1000]	" it was an accident , " she said . " he was just about to come . it was in the other room . " " we wo n't make any of this up , " he said
[992/1000]	" why are n't you staying with me ? " " because i do n't want to be away from you . because it hurts you too much to be here . because i 'm just ... so damned
[993/1000]	her hand came up to her face , and for a moment , i thought she was crying . before i could say anything else , she brought her hand down , but then she gave me a look that

[997/1000]	i nodded with complete reluctance as i started to walk out . " wait ! " as i turned back around her i saw someone coming around the corner of the building into the lobby . "
[998/1000]	the man he was hunting seemed a lot thinner than i recalled . he had a scraggly beard and a scruffy and unkempt beard that probably did n't shave regularly . on his head , his head was shaved so
