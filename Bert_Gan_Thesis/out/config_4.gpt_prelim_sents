[3/1000]	a flash of metal caught my eye , and i jerked back . the blade was still embedded in the snake 's chest . only then did it suddenly open , letting out a throaty snarl . "
[4/1000]	" what about ... the people on the city perimeter ? " " i think that 's what happened to them . either i got them to do something , or someone came and sent them back for more

[9/1000]	" you 're missing the point , " i answer . " when was the last time you ate some of this stuff ? " " a while ago . " " where 'd you eat ?

[13/1000]	" it will also help us to locate his child 's whereabouts , " wlodek observed . " where did lissa get her information ? " franklin wondered aloud . " who was her donor ? " charles asked
[14/1000]	" that 's why i need to use it . " " so you can take pictures ? " " yes . " there was one thing she should know about it , though . <EOS> on
[15/1000]	i wanted to laugh . no big deal , no big deal . this was the end of the road . " you want ? " i waved my hand between us . cade held in the snicker
[16/1000]	another man started past , moving faster than the soldiers were . he was the one that was carrying an ax above his head . another guy in black stood a few feet away , ready to attack . but
[17/1000]	" when you want me to , " she agreed . " just come on over when you 're done , and we 'll talk . " he nodded . " got it . " he came to
[18/1000]	chapter 25 nick was awake and out of bed when i pulled in the front drive . i walked to the back door and opened it up , letting him know i was awake and ready to go out
[19/1000]	" i 'm about all right , " he said reassuringly . he took her warm hand in his left , and held it lightly between both of his as the boat rocked gently back and forth , sending waves

[22/1000]	" you do n't have to say a thing , " he said . " it 's not important . i 've read everything i can imagine . but not even a little , " he went on , "
[23/1000]	" let 's meet up after the meeting . please ... that 's all , then i 'll let you go . " not a question . " i 'll see you later . " " i
[24/1000]	her father reached for the door latch , but hesitated . a bead of sweat trickled down his forehead . " i 'll talk to you in the morning . " she hoped dad was n't going to
[25/1000]	she was silent while the phone rang . his eyes narrowed and his fangs lengthened . her gaze slid away from his and she gazed out the darkened window with a nervous blush . he wanted to push her out
[26/1000]	" you told her you were a human ? " said the policeman . the policeman looked at the human policeman and nodded . " do n't worry , when i got back from the city i found
[27/1000]	that , " she said , pointing her index finger right at him , " is the idea . " we all laughed . with a few more words of her declaration , and then her hand on
[28/1000]	she could n't stop herself from touching him now and the contact on her skin drew a groan from him . her hands itched to touch him . but his control was gone . and it would be too difficult
[29/1000]	" yeah ? so what exactly are you talking about ? " " i believe that you 're saying that you were n't sure if you were pregnant . that you had a miscarriage three weeks before her death
[30/1000]	" i do n't think so . " i held up my finger , warning him . " yeah . let 's see . " he reached into the briefcase and took out a ring box , shaking it

[43/1000]	" we 've got to find her . " the rest of the afternoon passed with little in the way of conversation . she 'd caught the gist of the conversation , thank goodness , and had told him
[44/1000]	something about the two of them , the strange way they used those words seemed to linger on the tip of my tongue . maybe it was the way they looked as they spoke , or the closeness of their
[45/1000]	" very good , the young man , but i 'm afraid i must ask you to leave now and make one last request of me . " " yes , sir ? " the youth 's voice was
[46/1000]	the other man moved into view . despite the fact that john was still there , john had to be careful . even if he managed to follow them , the three men would be too deep in the forest
[47/1000]	" oh honey i have a good idea . " lily is watching me curiously . her head arches back and i get the sense of her inner ear taking in a sigh . " ok let 's all start

[49/1000]	" who the fuck were you sleeping with ? " i glance around , wondering why they 're talking so loud , then shake my head . " i do n't know who you think you 're talking
[50/1000]	" why ? " she could not have seen her earlier , but the dark eyes held like a hawk 's , scrutinizing , searching , and the white teeth of her smile made him feel uneasy . he
[51/1000]	he saw my legs , and his gaze lowered . " jesus , " he whispered . i stood without warning , not because i wanted to , but because no way could i do my laundry .
[52/1000]	" you think ? " " if i must the punishment have to be , so be it , " and he kissed her on the forehead , " but the punishment also en dangers you . "

[61/1000]	" what is it like not being in charge ? " i say . " what do you mean ? " i ask , bewildered . " i see all this without one of you doing anything ,
[62/1000]	" it depends on what you want me to do . i 'll tell you what . " " what is that ? " " you need to take those clothes off . " " i want

[66/1000]	a smile and a question appeared on his lips . " you 're afraid it 's all going to be destroyed or torn limb from limb - " " i know that . " she ran a hand down
[67/1000]	" what can i say ? " he laughed . " i have a pretty good sense of humor . " he grinned at me . it was only then that i noticed what was once a perfect smile on
[68/1000]	" yes . perhaps it will be . " " i thought so . at least now we can all be together . but why did n't she do as we 'd ordered ? why tell you who she
[69/1000]	i opened my eyes and saw my hands . " oh . " he did n't seem inclined to say anything further . i closed my eyes again . i should stop looking at clay 's hands . i

[72/1000]	" i told her i did n't want to leave , that i wanted to stay in her life but there was something about her that had me falling for her more and more . " " did you
[73/1000]	" yes . " she sounded stunned . " i know . " i held up my hands in defense . " it 's not like this is some kind of big thing . it was just some stupid

[76/1000]	" did n't you know the night went pear shaped ? " she shook her head . " i was asleep . i did n't see you . the next thing i heard , you were gone . "

[79/1000]	" i do , " she replied as she lowered her lips to his . " i plan to , " he said softly and opened his mouth to place his mouth over hers . chloe pulled back immediately ,

[81/1000]	a nurse , a young woman from the hospital , called his name . " mr. anderson ? " he pushed up on the bed , and she helped him sit up . his forehead still felt pounding .
[82/1000]	" i 'm sorry i gave you such a hard time about my relationship with you , " he offered gruffly , his gaze sliding to her parted lips . " yeah ? and what happened in that regard
[83/1000]	his gaze was intense , his eyes filled with heat . he reached behind him and gently untied the scarf that held the ends over my hair . a shiver rippled down my spine as his fingertips caressed my
[84/1000]	when the men were far enough away , henry continued . " that says a lot . men , you know , we make our own decisions about what a man should and should not show respect to . we
[85/1000]	" yes , yes i came <EOS> i just got ta go now . " she said . " ok , well i 'll meet you in the bar ? " i asked , knowing , now , that
[86/1000]	this could n't be real . how could he be ... ? the woman started to throw up . " you did not ! " nick stumbled before he fell , thinking she was sick . nausea
[87/1000]	a tall boy was crouching in the trees , one hand on a rifle that leaned against his shoulder , one of his boots sticking out of the other . he held two dead children in his arms . he
[88/1000]	" i do n't want no way of telling . " " oh , of course , " she said with a frown . " that s wrong , honey . we 're going to give you that gift
[89/1000]	" i was going to say you 'd be our guinea pigs ? " i smiled , a bit too broadly . " you have n't asked me yet . " " you expect a man to be satisfied
[90/1000]	but i 'm still so sore , and i 'm so sore right now . the first time he entered me , he was ready to thrust , but he slowed to a crawl rather than stop . my legs

[97/1000]	she thought about how this was all a plot for her , but it was n't . she had nothing to do with this , and if it were n't for the fact that she 'd read dozens of books
[98/1000]	" ah . but that 's just it , " he drawled . he rubbed his hand down his face , as if to clear the expression . " i 've been practicing a lot . all of this stuff
[99/1000]	' and what if i wanted to run away right now ? ' ' then i would n't be so stubborn as to say no to you . ' ' but it 's all right for you to

[102/1000]	" so if we did this , what would i do ? " she knew it could be very dangerous , but she had no idea what her brother wanted more than this . she did not like hiding in
[103/1000]	" so do n't wait around , " ian told him , turning back quickly to give simon two fingers he would n't take from him . " she 's been so worried about you , we 'll take care
[104/1000]	" there 's a place you could go to look ... i 'll send you a few details if you like " he reached into his bag and pulled out a business card and tucked it into my hand ,
[105/1000]	" i did n't know whether your father would tell you or you went to war , or that you ... " she paused , closed her eyes and shook her head . " i came home one day
[106/1000]	" so what is it , then ? " she asked . he had walked up behind her . " nothing , really . i just do n't want to upset you . " " oh . you
[107/1000]	" it 's a good thing the world is over right now and you might not have loved one the way you love me , would you ? " " i do love you , " he says ,
[108/1000]	what would everyone be thinking ? this was his life ! of course they would think he was insane . and that was the problem . he was the one that needed to get out now before his brain exploded
[109/1000]	" why , " he echoed hoarsely . " i am sorry i 've been so secretive about the whole reason for this masquerade . " she twisted her hands , then looked at him with a frown .
[110/1000]	i rolled my eyes and dropped my backpack by the bed where i 'd been sleeping . " you 're right . i should go before i cause a panic . besides , i need to get going , anyway
[111/1000]	" i wish you had not . but as such i shall have to ask you to respect your word , and no more . " she was silent . this was difficult for her to do ; the
[112/1000]	" oh , he did , did n't he ... " alexandra 's voice trailed off as she turned to her friend with a serious expression . " are you all right ? " she asked . " no
[113/1000]	" have you already read one , son ? " " yeah . " " i read <EOS> , and i read the latest , mr. taylor , but not much else . " he paused . "
[114/1000]	" i told you i was nothing . a failure . " my eyes dart toward the door . i thought i was fine . " if he touched me , i might have cracked . i ca n't let
[115/1000]	" go back to bed , " she said . she could barely keep from collapsing again . " i ... ca n't . i swear . " " well , just tell us what you , that
[116/1000]	" i really wish i could tell , " said the driver . " but i ca n't . " " the truth is , i do n't know . you 're very curious about me . "

[118/1000]	a man wearing a dark blue , open - necked , fitted shirt and khakis that seemed to fit loosely wrapped her and his entire body . " that 's adam . " his voice was close to her

[120/1000]	there was n't much . a little box from the store that told him what type of car he was driving ; a dented black mercedes , the tires badly mangled from time having been squashed . no windows .
[121/1000]	" no worries . i got you . you know you can open up your own kit . " beth felt confident that a couple old tins of sardines and a big bag of chips were her best options .
[122/1000]	all right . yes ! okay , fine . she would not give her friends the satisfaction . " i 'm sorry . i will not argue with you . well , then , i 'll leave you guys
[123/1000]	' no , sir , ' said victor . ' my fault , sir . i took a quick break when ... when ... ' he began to say . the wizards stared at him . ' you

[125/1000]	" my brother and sister , they were born in england , right ? they were about twelve years old . i met my father on the trip . he said he knew my father . he explained to me
[126/1000]	" come here your father ... " i heard his voice suddenly take on the gravelly sound of his native tongue . i assumed it was an english version of english which sounded similar to other languages in the world
[127/1000]	he nodded a little . " this guy is going to call . you know that , right ? " " i 'm sure they do n't really know in advance that i 'm going to call you .
[128/1000]	now there was no mistaking what was really happening to me . i was falling into the dark pits of the night sky like a meteor , falling along with them . there would be no getting me out of
[129/1000]	he nodded . " i 'll call you back . " she hesitated a minute , then hung up . her heart felt like it was in her throat . " logan ? " in her mind ,
[130/1000]	" i will be good , if that 's what happens . " " good ? " she echoed , wrinkling her nose . " you are going to make me get my nightgown and i am going to
[131/1000]	" why do n't we just take a break ? a cold breather might help you to start thinking straight . " " it is n't that simple . the wound 's just been cleaned . i 'd prefer
[132/1000]	i could hear the people speaking now . they sounded panicked . " it 's just one person . " i spoke softly and moved as steadily as i could . " she 's just a boy . "
[133/1000]	just as the captain asked us to leave he remembered he and i were supposed to be in charge of another important mission , right there , and he could n't keep the captain out of it if he wanted
[134/1000]	i had my good leg and one more leg . as i came down off the chair , i decided it best to take the stairs two steps at a time , so i would get at least one fall
[135/1000]	" you 're saying you do n't care that i 'm getting married for the first time ? " she said . max shook his head . his own thoughts were so dark , filled with the same guilt
[136/1000]	' it 's your last chance , ' said the barman , in a quiet , sympathetic tone . ' get away . please . get away . ' he reached into his pocket , pulled out a fistful of
[137/1000]	" good morning mr. clarke - i appreciate the effort and if our relationship is going to progress much quicker than i was led to believe it will be - i would hate to be forced to have to take

[141/1000]	" wait , " he said . " stop right there . i ca n't explain this , but i 'm going with you . get in . " he pulled the door open and paused to look at
[142/1000]	that set them all on edge . it took a long time to get to dinner , and they were in a state of fear as they ate . they ate at a table , it was still early
[143/1000]	" yeah . " he smiled , looking me over like he wanted to examine every angle . " would you like some of them ? " i laughed and shook my head . " no . i would
[144/1000]	he tried to sit but his joints refused , so he sat back , closing his eyes . how long had he slept ? of course , a day or two . that did n't bode well . he opened

[153/1000]	" wait . " the woman took a step toward him . keenan did n't move . " i 'm not leaving by myself , " he told her . " but i know your weakness . "
[154/1000]	" okay , you can do it , " he said , and the smile he gave me reminded me so much of my dad . i pulled back from him . " you 're the master of what
[155/1000]	" i 'm not a f * * king demon . i was only ... there was a difference . he came to me , " he lied again . " i can tell by the way you just
[156/1000]	a faint stirring off the shore distracted him , and ian came away the circle . she thought briefly that the man might be a friend of ian 's ; he was lean and fair , with brown hair ,
[157/1000]	i did n't even register . my brain was busy processing information floating around in its giant , angry brain . the black and white pictures made sense . all this time there had been a person living in
[158/1000]	but the reality was that it had n't been a pleasure . it had been a struggle . she could n't stand to think of any man in that position , so , instead of allowing him to take
[159/1000]	" my job , " she blurted , " is just to keep everybody alive . but i do n't understand why anyone would want to burn down the coliseum ... or punish people . a lot of them died
[160/1000]	" you will go to their house , " he said . " why ? " " they are trying to make a trade and those in the village know this is the time when they need to
[161/1000]	" the way you sound about her . " " we both know she 'd be an insufferable ass * * le , " i say . " if you say so . " we hang up
[162/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i asked . " in the end , it was n't for him to decide . it was for you . it 's not the same thing . " " you
[163/1000]	there had been a time i missed that - all the money , the clothes and the house . i 'd thought i 'd have no more to look forward to after my parents died and i did n't .
[164/1000]	then , i was n't even pissed anymore . i was pissed at myself . how had i gotten so lucky ? when i woke up the next morning the first thing i forgot was that at some point
[165/1000]	they could end up as enemies , and so he did n't care . " we can play this game , or we can turn us around . either way , we ca n't have the other team win the
[166/1000]	" it 's in my nature . " he was an animal now , the wolf taking over . only its nature ruled its mind . " let 's go home . " i 'd done it . i
[167/1000]	the entire town was inside the house . with that thought , he threw both knives away . he and the other assassins moved quietly down the stone garden path , silently making their way to the front door .
[168/1000]	" i 'm glad to help , " i said , " but i do n't need to help . it 'll take more than a few minutes to get them loose . " " how are you going
[169/1000]	she swallowed over the sudden lump in her throat , feeling herself flush . <EOS> ... " what are you doing now ? " it was n't even in the dreams - it was n't right - but it was
[170/1000]	i take the cigarette and replace it in the ashtray . walking over to tarin , i put my arm around him . " well ? " i say . " did you see ? " he shrugs
[171/1000]	" i 'm no longer his mate , " he told her , which was surprising considering the way she 'd acted when he 'd first introduced her to his species . she 'd chosen him for what he was
[172/1000]	" will it burn ? " " no , " said yama , and then sat down to think . he left the ring of fire in the air : then , as if to punctu ate his answer
[173/1000]	there were pictures of ethan , his hair and eyes , and the black clothes he wore . he had even taken the leather - clad women by surprise . they each tried to cover his face with their
[174/1000]	but it was never going to be over . i was standing in a busy mall parking lot , wondering if i should try out for the homecoming queen position . i wondered if i should try out
[175/1000]	" i 'll make up a bunch of things ! i was gon na give you a big ole kiss . " she stepped into the bathroom . " you 're a bad influence , " i snapped .
[176/1000]	" i do n't think i 'll ever be the same , " i muttered . <EOS> ... i 'd said , that night , that i had turned away from the dead in school , but it had
[177/1000]	" so you want to try it ? " " i do . " " how many - " " i ca n't say . " his mouth finds mine and i seal the deal . this
[178/1000]	that made his head jerk in her direction . he recognized the look . just like that he immediately recognized their bond . his twin had been inside of her mind after the second time she 'd gone into passion
[179/1000]	" i 'm coming , " she said . " get your stuff , and get going , before someone gets hurt . " she hung up . * * * i should have figured it would
[180/1000]	" get back to the bedroom and get dressed . " in a panic , she tried to run for her drawers , but he held her firmly fast - yet she felt him pressing against her , pushing
[181/1000]	the nurse pulled her out and guided her to the bed . " the doctor will be home soon , " she said and headed back to his office , with a bag of groceries clutched in her arm .
[182/1000]	" never mind that . " sam was grateful he did n't sound as if he wanted to throw it in her face . the last thing she needed was for herself to be involved with this male . "
[183/1000]	" the one i 'd like is a boy . " " two girls . " he said it nonchalantly , but i could tell he was on to something . it was just a question . i
[184/1000]	without knowing better , she touched his arm and said in horror , " you ... you saw what happened . " " the vampire was very clever with the knife , " santiago remarked . " his aim
[185/1000]	" would you let me , ma'am ? " i glanced again at his shirt and felt my own tears begin to fall . " please ? i 'm out of my mind with grief . " " of
[186/1000]	" i had n't thought about that . " " there 's a lot to work out , " he said , running his hot mouth across her neck . " how was your day ? " "
[187/1000]	she turned and laughed under her breath for a long moment then she stopped and sat and stared down at them for a serious moment , and then she stood and walked slowly toward them . he rose and
[188/1000]	ryan had just finished dinner and her legs were starting to tremble . he 'd told her a few times that he would n't be there long , but that he 'd be back . it had n't been easy
[189/1000]	" i want to understand him . how would you feel toward him ? " she shook her head . " i do n't know . " " then i am just the same as your god .
[190/1000]	' well , ' he said , ' now you know . ' she got out of the car , got the car door , and looked round . the road wound round and around the side of the
[191/1000]	i said , " there always turns to be another battle , when there is more to fight . " " so that 's your motto ? this all seems pretty normal in what you write . so why
[192/1000]	" no one 's following me , " he lied . the truth was , he was n't feeling well . not even the caffeine . " i know , " she said , surprising him . " i
[193/1000]	" that 's the stupidest thing to do . " " do we have a place to stay ? " " it 's not exactly on my itinerary . " " who 's on yours ? "
[194/1000]	" what ? " i asked , confused . she smiled widely and nodded enthusiastically . " you know , before he ran away and never looked back ! i 'd hate to have to call my dad and
[195/1000]	i made it to the door , locked it , locked the kitchen door as quickly as possible . i threw on a hoodie , another t - shirt again , and was halfway out the door when i thought
[196/1000]	she grinned at him even though her insides were still dancing as if in the midst of a tornado . " then , you did have a chance . " " i am a lucky man , " he
[197/1000]	" we have the same interest , " paul added , and then hesitated . " did you know the woman 's name was susan wentworth ? " thomas stared at the picture of john wentworth . " no
[198/1000]	' no . that 's no true . ' ' why is n't it true ? ' i demand . ' what do you mean ? ' i 'm a little surprised that he 's confused by
[199/1000]	" i 'll probably be out late tonight , so we 'll see you tomorrow . " " okay . maybe it 'll be easier to get away . i mean , it 's only a six - hour
[200/1000]	" no . i want all of you , especially you . there 's no need for sex . we just want to keep doing what we wanted to do . i 'll ... i'm sorry . " he
[201/1000]	" did a man kiss you ? any man ? " a tremor shook her shoulders . " no , why - why do you ask ? " she took a deep breath , took another . " his
[202/1000]	" oh , it 's going to be okay , " she said . it was true . she was surprised that anyone at all could find her . " you must be the granddaughter , " mrs. mau
[203/1000]	" of course . " he paused , trying to think of the right response , not sure what to say . " you made her cry , " he finally blurted out . it had taken much
[204/1000]	" i hope i do n't have to live in the future with you ? " she felt herself blushing with panic at the thought of what the future held for that family . " you really want to
[205/1000]	what could he say to that ? " i 'm sorry . you have a reputation for never taking well to strangers - but there 's something about you that makes me like you . " now , she
[206/1000]	" and that he is a good - for - nothing , a f * * king traitor , " i snapped . " he 's trying to kill heven as well ! " cole swallowed and nodded .
[207/1000]	that did n't surprise me though , but it upset me : the things he did n't even think about were the things he did n't do . when i was little , he insisted things are all way too
[208/1000]	they shook hands and hugged , leaving the same kind of awkward hugging in their wake . chapter 34 ben was n't happy about the conversation . " what 's going on ? " he asked .
[209/1000]	i watched as my sister stood up looking beautiful and happy , i felt a wave of emotion , almost overwhelming . a stupid one , but it still overwhelmed me . but what made it better was that i
[210/1000]	" oh god no , i never say that . you ask too many questions . and even if you did , it does n't change anything , does it . " " the people here were going to
[211/1000]	" you could ask me if you think he was as charming in the sack as in the street , " julie pointed out . and meredith knew why she was trying to make light of it . " the
[212/1000]	" all right , i 'll be there as soon as i can . " chapter twenty - five i 'm on my bike the next morning and i 'm driving to the school . i check my
[213/1000]	' thanks , ' she said when he stood up . ' i 'm still sick of wearing tights . ' he walked the two blocks , and found she was the same size as he was . they
[214/1000]	" be careful out there , " the boy replied . then he went inside , and i watched him go . there was no sound , no scent , no indication that he knew we were there , even
[215/1000]	then to tell mr. cataliades about our plan for tonight , i thought of something , and i said , " i do n't see how that has anything to do with mr. cataliades , because he is the only
[216/1000]	" good , " i whispered . i had something to tell him . i did n't want him to go to sleep and take an extra six hours with the dream . i worried . as much as
[217/1000]	" oh , dear , " she said . " do get our coats , please . i 'm freezing into my skin . " the lady helped the lady into the coat , and then helped her put
[218/1000]	" god , you 've been here ? " " yeah , there was n't much of a choice . do n't you guys stay out of the house any longer ? " " what do you mean ,
[219/1000]	" do you think he ever saw everything that it was , this place ? " " ' they do , ' " said the captain , " ' to all but the most important thing . ' "
[220/1000]	" it was a joke ! " there was a pause . " a joke ? " he repeated . he was quiet again . he was back to that old silence again . " how ?
[221/1000]	" yeah , what are you doing here ? " i said , not wanting to admit a thing to him . " i hope you 'd like me . " " yeah , " i said ,
[222/1000]	i nodded . " i 'm sure . " " well , " he winked . " i 'll see you in the car . " i followed him down the porch steps . " you know ,
[223/1000]	" and just what am i forgetting ? " " you 're saying ' i want to ' . " " so ? " another sigh . " does that confuse you ? " " more
[224/1000]	" i wonder the time is so close . maybe it 's the last day and i wo n't hear him . that i have to figure out how to handle the world i lead . maybe it 's a
[225/1000]	if only it was that simple . he would get on a plane and fly home . then he would look back on this moment with the feeling that everything he had begun in life had been meaningless .
[226/1000]	" she 'll have a good look . " she shrugged . " is n't that right , dear ? " she looked at me suspiciously , and i realized i had been staring . all eyes were on
[227/1000]	" you must be joking . i 'm having dinner with anna this evening and we 're going to talk about that place . " my voice takes on a harsh edge . " i 'm not a good student
[228/1000]	" well , i 'm glad of it . but do n't call me ' mrs. brown . ' " she gestured to the chair next to her . " do you have something to drink ? " the
[229/1000]	he pulls me into a tight hug and releases me . " i have friends . i can even give you information , " he says , pulling back and putting a smile on his face . " now ,
[230/1000]	" yeah , and do n't worry , they will enjoy the same . but that 's not why i was waiting up here for you . i wanted to make sure you had a decent trip . you 're
[231/1000]	" to hell with that sort of crap . i am sorry 'bout that . the minute they took us , they started callin ' out the shots , you know ? what are you gon na do ? "
[232/1000]	" as much as i loathe to admit it , " charlotte said , " but you do need to keep up with all the laundry . it takes very little for a woman to get one of those sheets
[233/1000]	" in my own way , " she said . he took a sudden step forward , his eyes narrowed . " i 'm glad you told me , " he said . " what ? "
[234/1000]	he shrugged , not wanting to talk about it even though it pained him . abby slipped her arm in mine as we began to walk , her fingers played with mine . " you ca n't be mad
[235/1000]	" look at your hands , " i said to myself . this was like something out of nightmare , something i felt like i was n't really awake . i looked down to the ring with its little
[236/1000]	" and she was worried about you . " " yeah . " i nodded . " i know . thank you for listening . " " it is my job . " he nodded in response and
[237/1000]	but what was a girl to do now ? and what was a girl to do now that the girl she had left was gone ? * chapter 10 the sound of the bells on the
[238/1000]	he had two shots , a single shot , of something she 'd called the p into , a silver magnum , and the car was on fire . the car could n't be anything else , and she needed
[239/1000]	' well that settles it then , does n't it ? i 'm sure they 'd love a couple of kids , is n't that right ? ' ' if i say yes , you 'll have to arrange
[240/1000]	the professor paused for a moment , staring at the two of them with a look of wonder and disdain . ' who are you ? ' he snapped . ' i 'm sorry , professor , '
[241/1000]	he 'd been so mad , he started talking about his new life as a pilot to some imaginary crew or space - born alien , letting us use his instruments ... " " and ? " "
[242/1000]	" and that 's the way i look at you . like i 'm a special person , a special man . i know that now . " she nodded slightly , and then frowned and then returned to
[243/1000]	the king 's voice broke their reverie as he cried out for his son , " who 's the thief , girl ? " she looked up , wondering who the thief was , but stopped in her tracks
[244/1000]	" okay . " he said . " you 're not done telling me you ca n't eat . " there was no use lying . " i 'm not . you have to trust me . " i
[245/1000]	" so , she ... was she a normal girl ? " " according to her , she was , " said lily . " but she died back in the sixteenth century . as i understand it ,
[246/1000]	" very nice . but not as nice as new , " he said . i could n't help it ; i smiled . " i 'm a cat . it 's not a little feline that you should
[247/1000]	and he 'd still been waiting on his own . he did n't remember how he 'd gotten back to the bar , but he had . he 'd gotten over the horror that was his mother 's death
[248/1000]	" of course it is , " she said , still in an amazingly calm voice . " and those scars are back there , not really scars . " i pointed to the edge of the back .
[249/1000]	well , at least he was open enough to me to tell me if we were or not . i turned and looked him in the eyes . his mouth opened at the same time his eyes changed ;
[250/1000]	but it 's also true that i have n't given up and have n't given up wanting to get back at her . i look back down at my plate and the chicken . i feel my throat tightening
[251/1000]	" why , you mean my fault ? " " yes in a major way . well , yes , your guilt was justified in my eyes , yes . actually , i have no idea why that is
[252/1000]	she hesitated , unsure what to do . she could n't keep feeding him what he needed after the dream he left in her heart . her emotions were so tangled back then . she was in one head over
[253/1000]	i 'm such a bitch . i shut off my alarm and join her in the bed . we lie side by side , staring at the dark ceiling . " you ca n't hate me forever ,
[254/1000]	" yes . " she was n't surprised . he spoke nearly every day . the two of them had done both things in the past , she had discovered , and she had never wondered about them .
[255/1000]	" one day , " he said . " come around to your original location . we 'll meet at one of these . " " okay . " <EOS> five forever . the idea of him
[256/1000]	" i want to fight you , " she said , " do n't you understand me ? " i lowered my eyes . i was too angry at her , and she was too innocent , right now
[257/1000]	the man was n't a soldier . even before he joined the team , he 'd been a warrior through and through . one who lived for combat and he did n't give a single shit that he was a
[258/1000]	and then they came back . in that second i knew i 'd been made for this , that somehow the only way a person fit into this world was through me . i also knew that i belonged somewhere
[259/1000]	" hey , sweetheart . i 'm home . come on in . " jeremy opened the door wider to invite me inside . in the past two weeks , mom had been extremely attentive to me . i
[260/1000]	to his surprise she threw herself at him . kissing him , tasting him , she hugged him , her br * * sts against his chest . his c * ck sprang up to attention and she squirmed against
[261/1000]	he took hold of her hand and leaned down , brushing her lips with his as a gentle caress . " you do n't have to do anything . i 've got you . " he let his eyes drift
[262/1000]	" tell me , " he said , his voice a whisper . " how do you feel ? " i thought about it . pain , but it was n't as bad as it used to be .
[263/1000]	" did you notice exactly how this set up works ? " " no . " " they 're set in stone , which means they were designed to protect the portal . if you tried to escape
[264/1000]	her words did n't help . what if a doctor did n't come ? what if , by getting rid of her , he 'd become part of a bigger problem . a problem where he failed in every way
[265/1000]	" it 's a family name . i remember my grandpa 's great - great - gramps as a farmer too . it 's about his grandfather who was a farmer too . " " the only family i
[266/1000]	and yet nothing happened . and when i finally stood up , it was almost two a.m. i lay in bed , staring up at the ceiling . a lot had happened in the last six hours . it
[267/1000]	" it was ... they were so surprised when they saw their friends in the market that they could n't even think of it . their eyes widened and they just started laughing . " but why that ? why
[268/1000]	and i was right back where i started , as usual . " so there really is something going on between you two ? " beth asked . " of course . " " but ... you
[269/1000]	well , who could answer that honestly anyway ? " i like that , " i decided . after all , he wanted to , and what had he forgotten at the pub ? " that ? "
[270/1000]	" well , you 're not ready yet . " " no , not yet . " she hesitated . so he would n't know soon ? with no chance of coming ? she 'd always done
[271/1000]	" and you 're okay with this ? " i 've never questioned his decision . i 've assumed nothing was wrong , at least not until we arrived . that thought is laughable . " i think so
[272/1000]	" no , " i protested , still irritated . " i like the way you kissed so soft and just so ... simple . " one more flick of my eyes and i was walking back toward the bench
[273/1000]	her eyes darted away from him . " what 's wrong ? " he was quiet for so long , and then he said , " i 'm afraid , " with heartfelt regret . " of what this
[274/1000]	there was only one problem with that plan . it was n't something michael wanted <EOS> and kill things ( that ate zombies , and she pretended it was fun . it was n't that she was drunk , because
[275/1000]	" no , " he murmured . " that was all it was . just your own selfish attempt to trap me into marrying you . " " not entirely my fault you were with my aunt and uncle
[276/1000]	" what that means , captain , is that you 're going to find that other ship , that one called the i onia , the one that was in the main bay . that boat was carrying an entire
[277/1000]	" yeah , yeah ... hold on , i think i caught the general . " i reached for my phone and found the text from abby . she 's driving me insane ! chapter twelve abby
[278/1000]	" i am . " in all the confusion that had followed the two of them , a moment after she 'd begun a long , steady journey , a person could n't have been more surprised to find
[279/1000]	" oh , honey , " she said . " what 's wrong ? has he hurt you bad ? " to my surprise , i reached out and grabbed her hand . " we 're not worried about
[280/1000]	" this is not right ! " wailed the vampire . " the king has his soul ! he can not . " i walked back to the throne and looked at my new friend . " what happened
[281/1000]	it was a good bet that the new guy was nick . so , after some questioning , i followed him into the office . i sat there in silence , my heart pounding . this was it .
[282/1000]	" no one here knows the rules , " she said . the three members of the brotherhood were n't exactly a blur to me . i could make some assumptions , but only for an instant . i
[283/1000]	" he was n't there , " i said , as though it made no difference to me . i looked at the sheet still clutched in my hands . " though he might have been . " he
[284/1000]	which he had meant , for all to walk through as though a hundred people were living in one soul . " i will not die , " he had said . that night , there was no fire
[285/1000]	" good ! " ben exclaimed . " now - a word , please . " " of course . " a white hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him towards the crowd gathered around their table .
[286/1000]	she stood , and with a gesture for me to stand with her , she led me to the door and opened it . " he 's out back , " she said . " he 's in a shed
[287/1000]	jack and i did not walk away from the park , ever . we walked through the streets until we reached old walnut hill , where we stopped . then we sat on the lawn of an old maple
[288/1000]	they arrived back to find the hotel not only had no furniture - a big bed with a king - size soaking tub , and a marble desk of marble marble proportions - but also the tv . with its
[289/1000]	" oh , " she croaked . her breath came hard and fast , and it had the opposite effect on his . " are you okay , miss mac guinness ? " she could n't deny that
[290/1000]	i blinked again as i did the eye roll . " it 's not . this was from about two weeks ago . does that really shock you ? " " you do n't know this . "
[291/1000]	" okay , yeah . let 's go find them . " he did n't say anything but the next thing he did was grab me , his mouth taking mine in a way that left no doubt on
[292/1000]	" you just say the word ... and it 's gone . when anyone says those three words ... that kind of sounds like torture or something . " she felt herself blushing , and she was n't the
[293/1000]	the next message was from his cell phone 's display . that was all . he dialed alex 's number . the person on the other end made the next message un acknowledged . alex 's cell phone
[294/1000]	his eyes narrowed on my chest for a heartbeat , then he moved his head away , like he was going to do something , his eyelids dropping to cover his eyes . i could n't read those eyes .
[295/1000]	" that reminds me ... " i had remembered something . when i pulled out my list and looked at one of the receipts , it got even more confusing . i paused . my list had been taken a
[296/1000]	" well , i like you . i <EOS> you see how a woman eats a man for dinner . " " yeah , you would , " her son stated . " i 'm more one of those
[297/1000]	" i know it would be a very bad idea . " " do you think he 'd try to hurt me ? or use my wife against me ? " anger burned in his eyes and he swallowed
[298/1000]	in my head , i chanted the same old words along the way . i used my words to call up all the memories . none of them were strong enough to override the memory of the pain in my
[299/1000]	i think about going back for him for a second . part of me wonders if he would like to stay with me . i still feel better once i 'm there for him . but i also know that
[300/1000]	" no . " i do n't give him my answer or my name , but i should wait for him to question me . he has several questions going every now and then and i 've decided that it
[301/1000]	" no , i 'm not . " " then i 'm going to take you home . " " well , that would only make it so you could take me home in handcuffs . there 's
[302/1000]	" i 'm not going to be a burden . " " you 're not a burden , " he murmured , placing kisses upon my temple before pulling back , his expression serious . " i 'm not
[303/1000]	" what is it exactly ? " he says , trying to find the one word that seems to satisfy him enough to release it . " it will be on the show of tomorrow morning with several hundred
[304/1000]	after all , they needed to be careful what they put into that bottle . there were certain risks attached to drinking alcohol . " what will you do now ? " asked simon as he sat back down
[305/1000]	" did you know that ? " i asked , my voice thick at the edges with emotion . " my dad and i have been close for a long time , " she revealed . " just a
[306/1000]	" you 're gon na get yourself all weak and mushy , " shane said . just as he said this , the door to the lobby shattered open and a teenage boy stormed in , looking angry and
[307/1000]	" i do n't know , " i said . " he 's my son . " " if he 's your son , whose son is he ? " " he 's one of my children
[308/1000]	" i should probably put my gun away . you know how you 'll get after this . " he sighed . " hey , i know you miss your favorite pair of shoes , but they 're still
[309/1000]	" and this is how he can be so good to his own people ? so good to everyone else ? " " i 'd imagine so . " she felt her spirits rise . that " him
[310/1000]	" and then , " i continue . " in the middle of the night we were all in the middle of a fight , lying side by side with our faces pressed together , and it was n't the
[311/1000]	" this one . ' now , would you kindly please take this one out of the cupboard like a good guest ? ' he said . ' but is n't it your fault the whole bottle is empty
[312/1000]	he was almost close enough that she could reach out and pat him on the head without him thinking she was comforting someone . " if i 'm not dead before they arrest us , we 're both dead after
[313/1000]	she waved . " did n't see you there , i 'm sure . " she put her hand on the counter and smiled and then did n't , and disappeared . " god , if i were a human
[314/1000]	" fine . " " what did you do ? " " i made him stop crying . " if i did n't know any better , i swear i 'd think that he liked that .
[315/1000]	then he 'd never take her with him again and no one would ever know unless he killed her , and even then , the lives of all his men would be in danger . no . he could
[316/1000]	" i believe you . he is a very perceptive man , " i observed . " that is comforting , " sighed ms. sutherland . " and i know you are good company . " there was a
[317/1000]	" what about you , emma ? " i began . " what do you do ? " emma shrugged . " i only work . " " can i ask why you do n't give a shit
[318/1000]	" it kind of is . " his eyebrows rose . " well , i 've got to go before i 'm late for class . " " are you scared for your brother ? "
[319/1000]	" i am going to try to keep myself occupied . and when you come back in , please tell mama i 'm not here . by the way , you might want to look at the door frame before
[320/1000]	i 'm glad i know this well . " " but he did , even before he found out about me . " " who told him ? " " someone wanted him to find out ,
[321/1000]	" then you 're free to go . " after a brief hesitation , she stood up , glancing from one face to another before gathering her things . it was a lot more difficult than she expected to
[322/1000]	i almost smile at the irony . i get so used to telling people every now and then : " you used to be my friend . " but now they do n't seem to see me at all -
[323/1000]	" if you 're planning on making me feel good for my last session of therapy , you 're being a big f * * king idiot . " i moved back a little , keeping him close . he
[324/1000]	" good heavens , " emily spoke up . " is n't the fire about to start ? " " as soon as you put your finger on the flames , it is , is n't it ? "
[325/1000]	" i 'll try , " michael said . " good , " she whispered . " i wo n't forget . " " promise ? " " yes . " he kissed her then ,
[326/1000]	when we took our seats at the front of the room , some of the other students turned to watch us , <EOS> much like me , as well as others . on the way back , i noticed a
[327/1000]	i held still and listened hard . i heard nothing . no noises , no activity , and no sounds from the ground below . or it was just me in my head . without removing my scarf and
[328/1000]	" that 's right . i 'm in love with her so she can kiss you without a scratch on her . " i could feel the amusement flicker over the edges of his mouth . " i 'm
[329/1000]	she nodded . " will it hurt when you try to call me again ? " he added . she nodded again . " i 'm going to have to take you to a doctor tomorrow ,
[330/1000]	" what ? " " well , " she said , shrugging . " all that work does you no good , i 'm sure . " " that 's not what this is about anyway , "
[331/1000]	no one would give her the time of day . there would be no food . even if she starved herself long enough , she 'd be fine . if only ... with a sigh , she reached
[332/1000]	" tell me this , sam . " she smiled tenderly at me . " is it true ? " i licked a salty tear that had escaped in time to stop the drops from sliding down my throat
[333/1000]	he was in the bedroom , flipping on the lights . " your eyes are n't really glowing , are they ? i thought <EOS> . " i snorted . " you 've got brown hair . "
[334/1000]	" this one 's really new , " said tony , " seems to be working just fine . " " oh , yeah , and how 's your dad doing ? " asked jonathan . " well
[335/1000]	a tall , lanky , elderly man with a thin , very frail face and a pinched , long , drawn face greeted me as i walked in . he had a book in his hands and waited for me
[336/1000]	" he and mom are taking a drive tonight to get back as i said , " she responds . she laughs at me when she says it . it 's good to hear her laugh . there is
[337/1000]	" come on , i said i 'm sure . it 's just business . " " i ca n't , " i tell him , and i know i 'm lying . i do n't want to make
[338/1000]	he stood at the front exit outside of the bar looking at the sign . he glanced around at the people who crowded the street and they would be there any moment , waiting to bring their food and drinks
[339/1000]	i look around a bit , trying to gauge the number of eyes staring at us from all sides of the booth . " three ... two ... one ... " the girl in the uniform raises her hand
[340/1000]	he looked as though he might deny it , then he started laughing . it was n't a nice laugh , one that said , " i 'm your mother .... " the rest of the week was spent
[341/1000]	' i might have one of those . ' said william , trying not to sound too interested . sach arissa moved toward the door , letting herself out . ' there 's something you should know , '
[342/1000]	" so exactly who ? " " um ... " " did you break into his house ? " my hands went to the side of my head and started rubbing my scalp , causing a knot
[343/1000]	" is that your dad around ? " he asked softly . " i do n't know , " she answered . " does he know where you 're at ? " she hesitated before answering .
[344/1000]	his head turned . " you really think you 're okay with that ? " she leaned onto the doorjamb , eyeing him pointedly . " do you remember it from the wedding ? " he nodded and her
[345/1000]	" the question where ? " he looked at the two of us . ' if we 're going with her , why do you all have to stay here ? " " we 're in the middle of
[346/1000]	" yeah , right . thank you . " " fine . i 'll be happy to fix something for you . " okay , clearly , he was leaving . she did n't want help , did
[347/1000]	" we need to leave . someone thinks he 's a spy . " his smile dissolved and he dropped to one knee . " may i , grace ? " she nodded , not sure what to
[348/1000]	" and if it does n't ? " " we always have the best ideas . " " and then what do we get ? " " we wo n't know until we try . " she
[349/1000]	" you did n't sleep with her , " i said . " no , i did n't , but you did . " " no . i never wanted to sleep with her . i thought she
[350/1000]	i look at the two dark - haired people beside me as i open the door to the small cafeteria . i can see through the narrow window that they 're not going to make it . i grab
[351/1000]	the air seemed to vibrate with electricity . everything was still . dead silence . no sounds from the streets outside , but lots of it inside the room . the fire was not spreading yet . " what
[352/1000]	" but does your mother have no memory of what kind of car i drove at eighteen ? " his laughter filled the small car . she felt his arms tighten around her back ; the sound so soft her
[353/1000]	" you do n't have to . " " my life , " she said again . no , if you do n't get me out of here , i 'll take him and make sure he does n't
[354/1000]	" all right , what do i know ? i 'll sit through a bunch of history so let 's get this over with so we can pick up where we left off . " " that good ,
[355/1000]	the first person i think i see is his head buried deep in a newspaper , but the second looks up . " ah ! " he says . " what 's up ? " i step closer to
[356/1000]	" yeah . " to everyone else around us , we were nothing more than a pair of pathetic human bodies , wandering here and there to look at the stars , wandering around to try and be more like
[357/1000]	the next morning i was up again early so i could make a phone call to the school and have my lunch lunch , and there <EOS> my usual . when i was with the kids . i thought about
[358/1000]	" come on , " rachel said , sitting next to kelly . with the window open , a breeze blew in , blowing the sweat back off kelly 's face causing her to lose most of her ponytail in
[359/1000]	* * * the next morning - i could n't remember the last time i 'd lain awake that late - i dragged myself out of bed and headed for the kitchen . it was as though a weight
[360/1000]	" you make a good point . you know , " she told us . " i was getting a little concerned that there were n't any real answers . the dead were just not in some of the
[361/1000]	" yes , you just do n't like people thinking you 're a pervert for having fun , with a certain reputation for being promiscu ous . " my voice was slightly louder than i meant to . "
[362/1000]	" i 'm just not looking for emotional trauma , " i said . the truth was , i never wanted any more pain to come during what was a pretty tough time in my life . even more so
[363/1000]	three days later he had n't stopped smiling . what he 'd told her was getting less and less likely , and at the same time it was starting to wear him down . he was n't in the mood
[364/1000]	she stopped , turned and looked at me and asked , " you okay ? " i shrugged . " right . " she smiled and asked , " you gon na go through with that shot ?
[365/1000]	" damn right , there will be a fight over that . " even as they spoke , <EOS> the words came out of my mouth . " so ... we 're looking for a woman . "
[366/1000]	he nodded , " yeah , i 'm in . i 'll get a room right away . " i nodded and started to get in the suv . i slipped my hand in the back pocket of my
[367/1000]	the man opened the door and left . what am i going to do with him ? he walked down the stairs in the direction of the kitchen , aware that he was getting rather hungry for food
[368/1000]	without a word , she turned on her heel and marched off into the crowd , her blond hair swinging slightly as she went . chase followed after . " you 're going to be fine . i 've
[369/1000]	" really ? " " he seems the type to have a thing for the little white bunnies . " " hey ! " " he told you he 's interested in these , did he ?
[370/1000]	" it 's okay to break up once in a while . " he stared down at her , and it looked like he was chewing his lip . " if that 's the case you should try being
[371/1000]	" hey , i 'm here , " he said , returning to us . " i was about to send someone over . " " do you want to wait for the others ? " i asked .
[372/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i asked . " nothing , " she said . " nothing . " " are you sure ? " i said . " i 'm sure , " she
[373/1000]	" where do the people of ar kor live ? where do you live , then ? " " in the kingdom of te ji , " said ydnas . " tel ador ion told me where tel
[374/1000]	" i think so , he 's a great guy . in a way . " " he 's been really good to you when you 've been going through depression recently . " " yes , i
[375/1000]	" yeah , baby , but just be careful around him . " " yeah , yeah , yeah . i know that . " " love you , okay ? " i smiled , " i
[376/1000]	she sat down in a chair and rubbed the back of her neck . my dad sat down across from me . " i wanted to tell you that your aunt and uncle are coming up and that they
[377/1000]	' i will not , ' says mr silver . ' my lady wants to hear all about it . it 's a very long story , and i am sure you will not understand it . but if you
[378/1000]	" she 's lying . she 's a whore . " " you are not taking that back . you are a good man . you were in love with a whore . " " i was not
[379/1000]	" what do you mean , the only one who matters , is ... " they were just leaving the diner when the door popped open . an older man was staring at them , his eyes narrowing and
[380/1000]	" oh , so he is leaving me . i like that . " i felt my face go red . she giggled . " i can see that . look . " i lifted up my head ,
[381/1000]	" no , actually i just saw him standing outside of the apartment complex . i did n't recognize him at first , though . i did n't think very highly of him until i looked into his eyes .
[382/1000]	" come with us . i have other plans . i 've been craving to see where you got your big smile . " i looked at his handsome face , the two dimples on either side . my
[383/1000]	" i 'm not saying they 'll send you on a real mission next year - who knows what they 'll do to another innocent person ? but i do n't care about anyone else at this table . do
[384/1000]	" take it . do you think she could survive if i took the entire box ? " " i do n't know . you do this , they will know . we have to make that chance .
[385/1000]	i was hoping he was n't planning on kissing me , because those kisses ... the ones i put him through were always worth it . i found a spot in the middle of the hall by my bedroom
[386/1000]	" i 'm fine . it 's a shame . " he was right . the old man was actually feeling sorry for himself . his stomach had been doing flips whenever he thought he saw something moving .
[387/1000]	i knew that . i knew how awful it was feeling alone in this house , when we 'd had the opportunity to visit , how lonely it was . and now those babies were gone . <EOS> -
[388/1000]	when the time came to leave , he wanted to keep his promise to her . he wanted to make love to her , take her to this place they loved and show her everything she 'd missed , but
[389/1000]	" are you hungry ? " daniel did n't really want to eat her . he wanted to watch . he wanted to capture the sight they made in her eyes . he was a big man and did n't
[390/1000]	" she did save us ? " i looked at the pair . the white lines on the gray walls in the room looked like they were painted . " she certainly did , " said the voice of
[391/1000]	" and what 're you thinking , my beautiful girl ? " that slow smile of his danced on his face in contrast to the scowl on my face . " you 're the best , " i said
[392/1000]	" i would n't dream of it . " his gaze went from her and around the room . she shifted uncomfortably . " in this room , if you have a good view , you can stare
[393/1000]	she looked over at me but i watched her look past me , looking beyond me , taking in the scenery and the flowers outside , into some weird tunnel . when she finally blinked , her eyes <EOS> -
[394/1000]	" let 's go find it . i 'll get the other two . " he lifted her off his lap and they went into the kitchen at the same time . she helped him eat the first one
[395/1000]	" what ? i never said that . " she was right , of course . it did n't sound like a compliment as much as a confirmation of the fact that they 'd had the most incredible time
[396/1000]	" no , " i reply with a shake of my head . i know he 's right about that . " no , i 'm okay . " " good . i 'll get to work on that
[397/1000]	i took a deep breath , gathering my courage to face him . i stepped forward , making sure to keep in mind my hands would n't interfere with his . but i was just waiting for the right moment
[398/1000]	" i thought that to be for me . " " she really had a crush on that young gal in school . i was about to tell you , but figured you and the girl would leave it
[399/1000]	" this is the place to die , " he said . " when it 's time for it to die , come this way . you are the only one who can stop me . " he pointed around
[400/1000]	" i think i think the guys are done when you 're done . i 'm going over a few things now ; you get some rest . " we got dressed and walked out to the hall of
[401/1000]	then he pulled away . " i think <EOS> my feelings are stronger than i thought , " and he grinned at her . " are you all right ? " " i 'm fine . " she shrugged
[402/1000]	chapter 6 the next morning , kate was n't surprised that derek had n't called her from this morning 's meeting . neither was she surprised to learn about the pregnancy . it was amazing how quickly her pregnancy
[403/1000]	" we 'll come back , " she answered simply . " are you all right ? " he asked , his expression worried , as if he 'd made a critical mistake . emma turned around and ran
[404/1000]	the girl gave the glass of water back to laura . " it 's a shame . one minute i 'm enjoying , and then i have to ask this guy about his girlfriend and kids . most of them
[405/1000]	' do n't you let her take you out ; she ca n't make you do anything if she wants you . ' her father stared at her with angry , dark eyes . not letting go her , she
[406/1000]	" we 'll manage it , " said his mother . " wo n't be at all ! i 'll be home for easter and we can eat <EOS> once in the garden , and maybe another party at
[407/1000]	the room had no windows and only a glass fence dividing the backyard from the porch , which gave up the outside world out on the back lawn . the patio in back was empty except for one old ,
[408/1000]	" i 'll be able to read this man 's mind , though , right ? " " do n't worry , i can get through it , " tom said . " there 's no time to waste
[409/1000]	but - she could n't . " what if we did n't come back . " she swallowed . " we 'd just tell the cops where we 'd come from . " " no . " his
[410/1000]	" are you sure you 're not sleeping with him ? " anna asked with a raised brow . " i 'm going to tell you something that i know you do n't know . he is more a
[411/1000]	" are you sure ? " jeff asked . " no , " he said . " why would i give it to you ? " as soon as he spoke , the thought hit jeff that she
[412/1000]	" you have a heart of stone , lord varys , " tyrion was informed . " do i ? yes , i do . i feel it far more keenly than most should . can we have our
[413/1000]	i know this makes me sound like a bad friend , but i truly did n't keep that secret to myself . i had only been going out with him for a month . " i thought you left
[414/1000]	" do n't worry , " he said . " that 's not quite what i meant . " " oh ? " " here 's the weird part , " he said earnestly . " do n't
[415/1000]	" let 's not make assumptions , " the agent said , looking around at the office . " and the fact that you look suspicious scares the hell out of me . this may not be the most unusual
[416/1000]	" oh , thank you . " i dropped the hand that held the weapon at my side and wrapped my other hand around my wrist , afraid of losing it when i tightened my fist . " my
[417/1000]	" the weather keeps on being a pain , " he said . " a little over twenty four hours a day . does n't like to be on the road too much . " we sat around playing
[418/1000]	" wait here , i 'm going to clean that ... " i nodded . she smiled at me and left . i stepped toward liam and leaned in close to him . " take off your clothes . "
[419/1000]	" yeah . sorry . i do n't understand ... " " what sort of things ? " he said , pushing his hands through his hair . " when you feel sick , do you feel dizzy ?
[420/1000]	<EOS> he rolled his eyes and pulled out once more to the foot of the stairs . he 'd lost a lot of sleep over this , yet he was determined to make the best of his new situation and
[421/1000]	her hair swished against her thighs , and then she was over top of me , straddling my hips . " look at me , baby , " she demanded . " i want to see that gorgeous face
[422/1000]	she was beautiful . a woman of beauty and poise . she 'd always been beautiful - until he walked into her life after she dumped him . " are you still paying me those calls ? "
[423/1000]	" and what 's that ? " when she sighed at my reaction , my answer must 've been wrong as well since she immediately asked , " i apologize for not being able to give you more clues
[424/1000]	the silence stretched out more than a second and yet it was stretching longer . i had made the right decision by inviting him into the place that seemed to have gained a reputation for being haunted by memories .
[425/1000]	but it was on the second day that she was disturbed by a soft sound which she did n't recognize . it sounded like a mouse scurrying across the floor . she quickly closed the window to conceal it from
[426/1000]	" thank you , sir , " he said , " and it 's always nice to meet it . " " i 'm the chief , " mr. hayes said , " when you get here , just
[427/1000]	" we ca n't find him , " i said . " yes we can . we 've got him , " kate said . " you 've got him on camera . " " i could n't
[428/1000]	" all those little boys and girls go on the run , and then they call for help . " " and it 's not safe for you , miss ? " " i ca n't tell you
[429/1000]	no , the house was really a mansion . she pulled out two front steps and climbed the side of the big mansion . she was surprised to find a door at eye level . the wood was rich
[430/1000]	i stood up from the table , too and stood in front of the wall . i pushed the chair in as instructed and walked to the far door . i pulled it open to exit my room . i
[431/1000]	" how are you holding up ? " she gave a long sigh . " i hate it , but in this case , i 'm doing what i can to find some answers . so , yes ,
[432/1000]	" why do you keep thinking that ? " she did n't want to talk before , and she was n't sure he 'd be receptive anymore . he had a tendency to forget things and get all emotional .
[433/1000]	" i really do n't know , " i told her . i did n't feel there was enough information for me to even figure out who he was , but it would n't take much for me to find
[434/1000]	" that 's really sweet of you , but i have a big date tonight . " " oh come on , if you thought i was going to come and ruin your surprise , you really think i
[435/1000]	" but , " she continued , " after what happened this morning , i was just waiting for mom . and no , dad did n't call me at all . neither did you . you left late the
[436/1000]	" i suppose that 's why you came to me . " " why ? " he looked at me , genuinely puzzled . " because you do n't deserve to get hurt . " " i
[437/1000]	" what are you trying to hide ? what 's wrong with you ? " " he 's never there ... never heard it ... " " and what 's done is done . there would be no
[438/1000]	sam had not wanted to be a spy when they met , he had wanted to move back away from their base and face the real world , but his dad had insisted on seeing how they had survived the
[439/1000]	he reached for his canteen and gulped it down . the water burned his throat , burning his stomach and making his eyes water . " i wish i could help you , " the man said . he
[440/1000]	he was n't saying anything . just staring at me . i had a feeling he was trying to look at me as if he was remembering . he moved his head slowly from side to side , then slowly
[441/1000]	" why ? " she felt sick at the notion that no one - no one - was there to tell her that her father was dead . " because he is - you know he is , "
[442/1000]	" i ca n't stay in this building . let me finish the letter . we 're almost to the end and i 'll find another place to leave it , maybe another boat or some other building . i
[443/1000]	when he emerged , he stopped where he was . " can i say the same to john ? " " that that was you ? absolutely . " she moved to her son , lifting his hand behind
[444/1000]	i shook my head , unsure what on earth was he on about . maybe it was just the way he said my name that made me think he was talking about our first night together . or maybe i
[445/1000]	" of course , now that you mention it , that was what it looked like . if you want me to forget it , you 're going to have to learn to act like one . "
[446/1000]	he did not bother to answer , simply shut the door behind him . at least she had finally spoken to him about something . " i 'm not going anywhere , " she said . at least
[447/1000]	only two times had his mom introduced him to her a few times and she 'd always been dismissive , insisting he be an only child . her constant disappointment in him stemmed from certain things , but this time
[448/1000]	" we did n't say a word to that , " i said . " as soon as this thing 's finished , i 'm telling everyone everything you have told me about the two of you . there
[449/1000]	i shrugged with an innocent look . ' you do see the world from a distance ; i take it that 's not a big deal to you . ' ' not really , ' my dad said .
[450/1000]	" yes . " " thank you , ms. bal ler . " the lawyer shook jane 's hand before getting in the car and backing out of the driveway . jane watched the car disappear , and
[451/1000]	" we are a pack , " adam said . " we have no tolerance for outsiders . " " what did you do with the vampires in your pack ? " i asked . " our council
[452/1000]	" i 'll have to go visit him soon . " " okay . i 'll let you know during a couple hours of my family time . " " it 'll be great to hear you .
[453/1000]	" ' tis good to see you again . " lady mel ton placed an arm around willa 's shoulders as the older woman led with her to a room at the end of the hall . she had a
[454/1000]	" ah , yes , the real question , " said mr. marlin . " you certainly did n't take the time to decide . " " he said he was n't a leprechaun ! " cried mr. marlin
[455/1000]	" it was very sweet of my mother to come back , " he continued , now very solemn . " i 'm extremely grateful . " i shrugged politely . " you 're lucky . " "
[456/1000]	" i have to go . " " i know . i 'll grab my stuff . " as soon as she was gone , we heard her car pull away . " i ca n't believe
[457/1000]	the woman raised her head and looked down in awe at the man beside her . " do you really think we can ? " " if we only knew how well , " added the man .
[458/1000]	i looked up . " what ? " i squeaked . " you are not making sense , john . " " the black queen , " he said and shook his head . " i heard it .
[459/1000]	he gave an exasperated little sigh . " i do n't know that i 'd go that far . " " i would , " i corrected . he ignored us both . " but that 's another
[460/1000]	" um , yeah . " he turns to pace back and forth in front of me and then spins around to face me . " you remember that when you and sam got divorced ? " " she
[461/1000]	and we went to see that new man . " mrs. norris brought her husband , mr. norris , to dinner , which brought quite a welcome change from the old days . he <EOS> kind of treated me
[462/1000]	" can you fix it ? " jim asked , " and do you make sure it 's okay " " he 's a soldier " ben corrected with a sly smile , " and a wounded man does
[463/1000]	" i 'm so glad you find us the same way . " " me , too . " * * * <EOS> and i sat to the police . it had been one of the hours
[464/1000]	and as if on cue , the three of them were joined by another woman - two of them the same age , the last blonde . he started to speak but one of the older women cut through
[465/1000]	" i would n't worry about it . i just think i owe my sister an apology and i will not ignore her unless she wants to put up a fuss . if you are really serious about this relationship
[466/1000]	" no offence . i heard some things , and i would still be in my prime to help you with your books . besides , they 're in some pretty dire circumstances . i 'd just as soon have
[467/1000]	the next morning , a small convoy of trucks stopped only at a river . in the distance was a large , metal building about a mile on their left . another one followed and they began to circle around
[468/1000]	" <EOS> " ( laughs . my guess ? ) the radio stations are n't the best . i always remember to keep an eye on the kid . but we drive to his house and i watch him
[469/1000]	" he 's having a party . " it was true . he had invited all the guests , including his friend , a new girlfriend , and his girlfriend , a man he did n't know too well ,
[470/1000]	i was n't able to figure him out ... if he had ever been like this - lost , hurt , confused . i was n't sure if he believed in god . or if he knew he probably
[471/1000]	' who needs it ? ' ' you 're a terrible liar , you know that ? ' ' i tell you all the time , it 'll be the same , i do n't say it out
[472/1000]	i was n't as tall as he , but he grew larger with each passing drop of rain . at least the leaves that were left on the trees rustled softly . his expression , though , did n't change
[473/1000]	" what ? " i said in an agitated voice . " she did n't die ! you brought her to me ! i 've killed before ! i will kill you for this ! " " that 's
[474/1000]	" there is one , " he said , and looked slightly sheepish . " you 'll be okay . we had to talk in the library , it was awful awkward . " i 'd heard that ,
[475/1000]	" yeah . yeah , i really wish you could go out in the open now . " i knew how good it was going to be as long as i did n't have to worry about any crazy
[476/1000]	she did n't exactly have to share the details , but it was still a damn good trade - off . " you remember being in one of those crazy episodes of that freak show where you turn all
[477/1000]	it was a small miracle , but i thought he 'd gotten over it pretty quickly , and the fact that the accident and the loss of his wife had changed him had even less to do with my being
[478/1000]	" i 'm okay , " she said . " i do n't know where hunter is . " his response was barely audible , but <EOS> - " here . " without a word , he

[480/1000]	" i feel like if i did n't , i 'd never stop . " " you love me ? " " i love you . but that 's not what i mean . it 's more like
[481/1000]	he could n't tell and had no idea what she was thinking . after that , he could only imagine what she was thinking . in a slow , brooding murmur , he said , " if you 'll just
[482/1000]	" oh , you mean you , " she said , staring at him in surprise . " you and your friends , they seem like a very brave place . " " we do have a strong constitution
[483/1000]	" is that why they 're looking at you like that ? " i ask , staring at his neck , wondering what he can possibly be thinking . " what ? " he sighs as he drops a
[484/1000]	" no . it would n't work . " he shook his head . " i 'm sorry . " " i love you anyway . do n't you ever forget that . " then i kissed her forehead
[485/1000]	" oh ... yeah , i was . " " and your dad ? " she asked , trying to sound polite . " he 's a professional police officer ? " " yeah , he retired shortly
[486/1000]	" you have to take my money back , " i said . " what do you do for a living ? " " i 'm a scientist . " she glanced around the room . the
[487/1000]	" you can not have it , " she said . " i am serious , " he said . " take it . " cassie felt her knees go weak and she had to sit down to
[488/1000]	" do you understand ? " i asked . she shook her head . i turned towards the back of the stage where one of the girls was standing . she looked like she was up to no good ,
[489/1000]	" that was hard , but really nice . " " oh yeah , i completely forgot about that . if i were you , i 'd start thinking , why am i a coward ? " i leaned
[490/1000]	from the far room : " we have it . " eph saw the man standing behind him , a woman behind him , and realized in the moment that it was a werewolf . it walked out
[491/1000]	' is this a normal situation ? ' he enquired . ' a normal situation ? now why do you say that ? ' ' because there is one such situation . so let us say , for
[492/1000]	i try to remember who the hell this woman is . the last person i 've seen who had a good memory and who came in a long way to the rescue is n't me . but it seems she
[493/1000]	" you have to , " i said , though i wanted absolutely no part of what was about to turn into blood slavery . " you want to , " he said , and i was so surprised
[494/1000]	" wait ... ! " i said , desperately trying to save him so he could be saved . he stopped for a second , then turned around . he caught his breath . " i think ... "
[495/1000]	' no . i wo n't . but what about the money ? why does she think i should pay you back ? ' margery listened to the deep voice through the phone , the words were muffled but
[496/1000]	" they 're not bad at all . we did n't go up there until today , we just went for a walk and we got lucky out there because some guy came running out of one of the houses
[497/1000]	" are you sure you have the right guy ? " he shrugged his shoulders . " he wants me to watch out for him from home and from time to time he 's back the next night .
[498/1000]	" i want to hear no more of this line of questioning . " " why not ? you 've already asked me questions . " " but it 's only been six months . " "
[499/1000]	" we can not see our destination , but we can see her a little further , " said james . " so it would be reasonable for me to say that she will be about fifty or sixty miles
[500/1000]	" no ... " " yes ? " " no . " he got on his knees in front of me and his hand went to my cheek . his eyes went to my temple . i
[501/1000]	" you 're right , " he said and was about to leave when she said , " i do n't want you to think that , in the two years i 've known you , you 've never asked
[502/1000]	" the council now holds that - " her head snapped up from his wrist as he got the message full force . she 'd finally figured it out . his soul might belong to her and hers alone
[503/1000]	" we have to get a hold of ar naud , " i answered . " the sooner , the better . we need to know where her husband is . " " is n't he a bit young
[504/1000]	i was shaking by the time i was done with what had just taken place . then he came at me again , his hand reaching up and putting mine on his chest . i was on my
[505/1000]	she lifted the veil . i made it . chapter six i kept my distance from cole as we headed to campus . the smell of bleach and paint was strong , and the hair on the
[506/1000]	" i am your brother , " he repeated . yes , it was true . the bond they shared was more than he 'd ever had with anyone else . " it 's just that i could not
[507/1000]	" maybe you can get her to leave , " he suggests . i look at him , puzzled , but do n't ask . i do n't think this will appeal to him when he 's trying to
[508/1000]	you are so much better at this than i am . you ca n't even open your eyes and see where your own is ! you have the power to throw out any man you want with no thought whatsoever
[509/1000]	we moved off into the storm , and we passed two small towns before coming to the town of kil burn . in one of them there was a small pub , and it was the one in which john
[510/1000]	" we were n't in a good neighborhood . " " then why did you call her ? " " i could n't give you that information . " " why not ? " " i
[511/1000]	" it does n't mean that she has to be my wife , " he added . " ah , i see your point about marrying when you are n't making sure you have enough money for protection .
[512/1000]	" no problems , " adam said solemnly . " that 's what i expect , though it always adds to the mysti que . " " you got that right , " adam said . " any good
[513/1000]	' i 'm sorry , ' he said . ' i can see your point . ' ' but those kids are alive ? ' he nodded . ' you killed them , liz . you killed your
[514/1000]	" she did . just as well she was dead , then . you could have had your finger in the pie , and not been bothered at all about your boss being sick , or whether she had known
[515/1000]	her hands were shaking as the doors opened . the doors whisked them through . one thing she 'd learned over the years was that they never gave her a break . they never stopped . they pulled her
[516/1000]	i opened my backpack and pulled out the cd . " i guess my life was less weird before your visit . " she made a face . " yeah , well i 'm not that happy to see
[517/1000]	" you think ? " i smiled , as i kissed his jaw and my hands ran up and down his muscular chest . " i really like you just fine . i plan to make sure you 're
[518/1000]	he caught the last of the letters and ripped them open . one was from a man named joshua green wood . the other was a much smaller and much older name : captain daniel green wood . as he
[519/1000]	" it 's time to go , " she said , handing him his suit jacket . ian grabbed the jacket and put on his jacket , then he turned and gave her a long , silent look .
[520/1000]	the next move will fall on me ; i 'm looking at the side of my face so this is too second nature to me . the next move , i can not even look at the back of
[521/1000]	and yet every last part of me was screaming at me to come forward , to go where i wanted to , to come the rest of the way where i 'd come where he 'd ordered . i was
[522/1000]	" i do n't know , " said mary ann . " we have n't really talked about this , i guess . " " but do n't you dare tell me that some guy who has money and
[523/1000]	he reached into the pockets of his pants and withdrew another stack of bills . the man shook his head , moved to a corner to sit cross - legged now . " your wife ? "
[524/1000]	" i have no idea . i am just here for a night of fun . what do you do ? " he asked . " i ... don't . i do n't have anything to do . "
[525/1000]	" what did he want ? " she asked as she slid her shirt over her head . " he asked me one last time if i 'd give him the words i love you , " he replied
[526/1000]	" i was not sure . should i continue ? " " no . " i did n't even wait for him to begin . " i 'm sure you 're a perfect one of a kind ,
[527/1000]	it was the middle of the night in ohio , and after sleeping with their little boy for the first time , it was early morning in new york city , and i had a raging headache . i had
[528/1000]	" i 'll be careful of him , " james said to james . " i 'd rather he do nothing than meet with the enemy , and i 'm determined that no one should ever meet with him again
[529/1000]	then come the dark . " " well , would n't it be a wonderful relief to see the sun warm up for a bit ? to be able to make it past the next , no sweat .
[530/1000]	" he 's always had this power . he could easily find me . " " why are n't you running to him ? " i asked . " i want your help . " " it
[531/1000]	i held them over the fire to warm them up , then walked towards them . as i closed the door behind me , i heard an odd sound and looked down to see the door was ajar . taking
[532/1000]	he paused . " yes , i ca n't take her , sam . " " that is not how i asked you to take her . " " it was your problem there , not mine .
[533/1000]	she went back to her seat at the table , and he joined her . " that looks good . " " it is , " she agreed . he had n't been sitting still much since seeing
[534/1000]	" that was ... " " brilliant , " she inserted , and then her voice caught in a sob . " so i suppose they were as mad as we ? i got to spend half an hour
[535/1000]	" so we 'll need to bring them all the way back to seattle ? " " i do n't know . i 'm not sure , " jeff admitted . " but i understand where you 're coming
[536/1000]	" oh , god , please , " i whispered . " i 'm on fire . i want you , " i whimpered . i felt him growl against my neck . all too soon , he pulled
[537/1000]	" we 've got to get these kids out , " jane said . " the monsters who killed all those parents and grand mothers now want to be free too , and we ca n't let them . "
[538/1000]	<EOS> " what are you up to ? " she sounded a little strange . " i wo n't talk much tonight , so i 'm just going to leave the room and come look for you tomorrow .
[539/1000]	" they told you about the drugs ? " " yes . it was in the paper this morning . they did n't say yet it had the same mo as the others and the money would have made
[540/1000]	she sighed , pushed him away , then laughed at her own joke , " you 're too late . " " well , just because i was n't able to get to him - " " you
[541/1000]	the old man nodded . " they 're going to be fine . " he gave a little nod . " do you know what happens when you ca n't use your cell phone ? " " no .
[542/1000]	" it 's just that when they put on the armor , it 's like a magic carpet to them . they charge into battle with their weapon in hand and are amazed by how fast that thing moves .
[543/1000]	i shook my head and pulled my eyes out of his as we walked to the car . " you were n't drunk ? " i asked . he shook his head slightly as he walked to the door
[544/1000]	he looked over at the two other females . standing on top of the wall , looking down on her , were three warriors - and they were staring right back . the bastards . the bastards had tracked
[545/1000]	" i have some good news and bad news . " " oh ? " " no matter where i go , you always know where you are . " " ok , ' winnie said ,
[546/1000]	i was n't even sure if he 'd had that reaction toward me , but i had to guess . maybe that was wishful thinking on his part . then again , he 'd likely seen me at school before
[547/1000]	" mr. winkler . " winkler ignored him . " i 'm hoping tony is in as well . his mother is sick and the pack has to pick him up . " " i understand . " winkler
[548/1000]	" how so ? " i asked . he sighed . " like someone gave up , just like we all did . we were a part of a lot of our lives now . a lot of people
[549/1000]	you . and i 'm here for you . come on , baby . we 're doing it together . let 's go . get in . and this time , i actually did n't need to run . i
[550/1000]	" and now that you 've shown me what the meaning is , i 'd know , " she said , placing her hand on my chest . " not only did you show me the purpose of this dance
[551/1000]	the last time she 'd had a long night was when she 'd put on the top of her skirt , sat across from one of the sheriff 's deputies and got ... oo h ing . she had n't
[552/1000]	" are you saying ... ? " i began and the phone went dead . " it looks like we 're going to need to get backup , " mike said , looking concerned . i was standing
[553/1000]	she was so tired . her mother was n't the only thing they had to deal with today . she was n't sure how long she 'd sit there in that tiny apartment , looking up into those dark
[554/1000]	" that depends from these two reports which your sister - in - law told us . " " what are you talking about ? " said ransom , and the old woman gave a thin chuckle at his
[555/1000]	she looks up at him and squeezes his hand . " i know it 'd be like getting hit by a car , right next to someone you hate . " " exactly , " he says . "
[556/1000]	" it 's all right . it 's an escape plan . " " so what 's all this about ? " he motioned toward my clothes . something in our relationship was still off , though ,
[557/1000]	he touched her once more , and this time , she went still beneath his touch . her gaze widened as she looked up into the dark , unfathomable eyes of the man who 'd sat next to her ,
[558/1000]	" you do n't happen to know the way , do you ? " " she 's in the second bedroom , " said frank . " " i have no idea how well that door will be locked
[559/1000]	" i do n't know why you 're angry at me . " " i 'm not angry at you , and i do n't think you want me to . i do n't understand how two people can
[560/1000]	" she should have been at home with her husband , " his father complained . " in no uncertain terms , i would advise that she be married to her husband should they both be unhappy with my
[561/1000]	" they were also all the same , " i reply , pointing at him . " why ca n't i move and talk ? " jack shrugs . " a lot of guys do n't know how to
[562/1000]	" it was one of those days when i - " she sniffed . " i lost it . " i took a step toward her , grabbing her around the waist and pulling her to me . it
[563/1000]	" how 's mom doing ? " " she 's fighting it , " nathan says . " she 's just trying to hold off . do n't worry , now that we 've got her in the hospital
[564/1000]	" i do , " i said and he cocked his eyebrow at me . i was n't going to let him know the part about him being too much of a gentleman for me to handle . i brushed
[565/1000]	he had to do something . he swallowed hard . trying to go slowly , <EOS> ... " um ... i guess . but i - i did n't . it 's a little family business . "
[566/1000]	he has a point . one we can probably turn up . but my interest is not in what a number of people can do . i am interested in what just happened . i want to know . i
[567/1000]	he took the envelope out and held it up to the light . " welcome to my life , " he whispered . chapter seventeen alex five weeks had passed since alex had first seen sam and
[568/1000]	" yeah , how are you feeling ? " she smiled weakly . " so much better now . " " i would n't say that . you look pale . why are you at that place ,
[569/1000]	" okay , " i said . " whatever it is , i 'll explain it . " " go ahead , " she said . " the night i spent on the island , " i said
[570/1000]	" you have n't even tried the coffee that i made with the coffee filters . what kind of a girl does n't have that ? " " as usual just trying the coffee . that i can promise
[571/1000]	she did n't care , not a little bit , if it went wrong . even if she did like to kiss him , she would n't admit it . <EOS> damn it , she really did n't want to
[572/1000]	" no . the best way to handle someone like me is to have a few more questions . " " do you know of any ? " " i 've heard of some of his family ,
[573/1000]	my face had come up out of my shoes . i reached out my hand for his , but he spun and put his finger over my lips and pulled me onto him . " it 's okay . i
[574/1000]	" thank you . " i blinked back tears and kissed him again . his breath was warm on my mouth again , and while i had been so stunned i had completely lost my train of thought ,
[575/1000]	" ' a few days ago , my dream ... ' " " your dream . " " the whole world woke me up , had me eat a glass of wine and then i went to
[576/1000]	the older man had no trouble imagining that he was the sort of guy i 'd enjoy being around while i served that woman . besides , once i went out for dinner , mom and i would inevitably be
[577/1000]	" this is my sister and her friends . we 're here for an important meeting , " rachel said . sarah looked at sam . " i 'll be right back right back . go on and sit
[578/1000]	" you are more than welcome to go in if you 'd like . " " i 'll ask my friends in the museum that i take you up on your offer . they 're a bunch of people
[579/1000]	" fine , " she snapped back at him . " your mother was there on that thing . so what ? " i have good news for you , i thought . it did n't come out ,
[580/1000]	chapter 28 the sun had risen some hours prior and in the last hour it had come into a small pool of rays and cast its long shadows across the ground . the night before it had been the
[581/1000]	" <EOS> we 'll have a big red flag in the corner <EOS> all the right to get some of the friends " . have n't you heard it ? " that 's what she did when she thought
[582/1000]	" i wanted to enjoy this and i did n't care what anyone thought of me or tried to say . " " when are you leaving ? " rachel asked . " i 've already checked out
[583/1000]	' she wants this <EOS> ? ' ' no clue . ' ' not yet . ' i 'm learning what i can do . ' ' well , there 's the whole , not knowing
[584/1000]	she was trying to understand what the man was doing to her other than helping her , what he was doing to her body and her mind . she knew him all too well now . she could never ,
[585/1000]	" that 's for sure . " matt smiled at her for the first time and rae could read his frustration as she looked down at the two teenage girls . " we probably should have talked faster then
[586/1000]	both he and her mother looked up as a tall figure came into the kitchen . " hello , aunt anne , " elizabeth greeted her . anne did not seem surprised to see her . she was
[587/1000]	i laughed . " yeah . i mean , yeah , it 's okay . i 'm glad you 're here . how are you ? " " i love new york city . how are you ? "
[588/1000]	" where are they ? " he asked the air she breathed as if to answer this question and then glanced around carefully to see if any of the occupants had heard him before he was able to turn his
[589/1000]	" you look fine , " her tone was not friendly and it was not either kind or judgmental . " you need a new hairstyle . " she stopped in front of me . she was taking a
[590/1000]	the line went dead . what the hell ? he looked down at the screen , and there it was again . a connection ... oh , god , was n't that exactly what the name on
[591/1000]	then the gun 's barrel rotated to the right , the cold eye sights aimed at the one who had given chase . chapter 24 " you son of a bitch ... you were playing me . "
[592/1000]	he could taste the excitement in her . he 'd taken so much pleasure in getting her off - and he would n't have gotten out of bed for weeks if he had n't wanted to give her a taste
[593/1000]	" are you hurt ? " he shook his head . " do i look like i 'm hurt ? " she pulled her shirt up and winced . " it 's a little scraped . nothing more
[594/1000]	" wow ! what did you do to his ear ? " cole asked . " that was a little more sensitive than it looked , " cole said . " it 's just the small of the back
[595/1000]	" so you never asked , " i say . he leans forward , elbows on the table . " and i never asked why a guy with a long zipper should wear a tie , and i certainly
[596/1000]	" we are not even close , " he corrected , setting down his coffee . " well , if you want to be . " he reached for her and she threw herself into his arms .
[597/1000]	" is it weird to have your own father ? " " like what ? " " weird being his son . " " yeah , " i said . i tried to turn away , but
[598/1000]	" why <EOS> did n't feel so bad , because you wanted to make them feel better . damn you , baby , we all feel so f * * king right and making - " " do n't
[599/1000]	" no , they were okay because they were n't the family that took care of that boat , and they were good people . " " to you . " i let the comment settle on me ,
[600/1000]	how could she have never noticed how strong the attraction between them was ? how could she not have recognized that the attraction and attraction that existed between them far surpassed their training ? she 'd seen too many guys
[601/1000]	" hey , " said bill , " would maybe we could help you and rosie out without getting you involved ? what do you think ? " " a little help was a great idea but i needed
[602/1000]	she opened her mouth , but i continued . " do n't hurt her . oh , hell , she 's about thirty . i ca n't believe we have to go through this again ... again ... " i
[603/1000]	" i did . she went out with this guy named johnny , i think ? " he could n't keep the contempt from his voice but the girl 's eyes widened . " i do n't know if
[604/1000]	i smiled . " yeah . but ... " i did n't give him a chance to finish the thought . " but right now , nothing 's going to stop me fighting . " chapter 15 as
[605/1000]	" that does n't have to be , " she said . " i do n't really know which family , or what sort of men , there are , who want to marry me . " she suddenly remembered
[606/1000]	" one , two , three ! " i shouted as i ran through the street . everyone ran . they all fell down in each other 's arms . my shoes were the only boots that did n't come
[607/1000]	' this is not to say that you are not a very unique lad . ' it 's funny you have to say that about such kids , is n't it ? they may be a very special type
[608/1000]	and it was the first time he had seen something this amazing to say right into the silence of the night . yet , he could hear her as if she 'd spoken - she was humming a soft melody
[609/1000]	" that 's where i was , " grace said , " waiting outside when a limo pulled up and five men ran out . " jack looked at his niece . " no one else in it ?
[610/1000]	" you 're a jerk who does n't know anything about me ? " she asked for the hundredth time , frowning . " only part of what you do is pretty much not important . " "
[611/1000]	he took her hand and placed it over the fire . the heat of the fire licked her fingers and the spark arced out from her fingertips . when his touch lit a flame in her chest , she felt
[612/1000]	" we need to speak with the police , " he tells me . " no , " i say angrily , feeling my temper rising . " we 'll tell them the truth . for all we know
[613/1000]	i told myself i had only gone to his uncle 's when the news came that i was being attacked at the time . i did n't think i 'd ever see him again . sure , it was n't
[614/1000]	" yeah i know , " i shook my head as i spoke , " he said if we could go and get some burgers . it would be a good plan . " " good thinking hun .
[615/1000]	" sorry , " i mumbled . " look , we need to get going . " without another word , i turned and marched down the road away from the house and the family . *
[616/1000]	i nodded , smiling , <EOS> ... my mom thought of me as a baby , how i was n't like any of the other little girls in the room . she 'd tried in vain to encourage them
[617/1000]	" one more thing that 's important , " she said . " what 's that ? " " you should wait here with the other guys . see if you can sort out a schedule . "
[618/1000]	<EOS> " who ? " asked jake . the man had never heard of jake . the term would have been too mundane for much to have come across him . but now he knew precisely what it was
[619/1000]	i watched her walk to the kitchen , her head held high . i knew i should n't have been so excited about it , but the more i got to know her the more i realized , that i
[620/1000]	" or maybe you could read and write in the little tin shed like everyone else . " that would explain the mess left while it was broken up . " can we do that ? right now ?
[621/1000]	' you should have walked the other way , ' lenk replied , peering into the dark forest . ' i do not want to leave that tree behind . ' ' if you want to come back
[622/1000]	" i 'm going to - " a figure appears before me , like a ghost from a dream on the other side of the glass . " i 'm here , " i say in a low voice .
[623/1000]	he nodded . " so you 're a big , strong guy with enough blood to be out there helping people ? how does a pretty little kid like you understand how things work , anyway ? "
[624/1000]	i closed my eyes and tried to push it aside . seeing what appeared on the screen , they were nothing compared to what we were seeing now . the house was an inferno . most of the lights were
[625/1000]	" i do n't want anything to do with the government because , well , one thing i just realized was that the bureau probably does n't care about the criminal code that exists in the world . in fact
[626/1000]	i grinned at him , turned around and walked through the kitchen to my bedroom . i opened the top drawer of my dresser , did a full body full body wash and the bathroom took up the entire entire
[627/1000]	" i need to wake up . this ca n't be happening ! " i shout as i kick my feet and thrash myself around with my mind screaming to get free . to no avail , i am trapped
[628/1000]	" no , but i can make it your game , " she offered with a little smirk . " well , we 're busy with a lot of things right now . just give me a few minutes
[629/1000]	" well ! you could have sent them a message , " she said . " would n't you have taken our call ? " " the message from the lady would have been delivered to me , "
[630/1000]	" yeah , i just found out . it 's pretty much the only thing going on here , " he lied , putting his arms around her . " you 're right ; they wo n't keep us
[631/1000]	' then then what ? ' ' then my wife will carry on as if nothing happened . you remember what happened when you made fun of her when she was little , ' he added with a smile
[632/1000]	he turned to me and for one second looked like the old jacob again , that face of terror and fear and terror and uncertainty . but then another smile spread over his face , and i knew this was
[633/1000]	" we need to talk . " jack opened the door . the parking lot outside was dark except for a cluster of bright red light globes . he was reminded of a christmas tree in a cathedral .
[634/1000]	i stared at her , my mouth dropping open . she never , never had that attitude . ever . " how do you know how i can get my hair done if you do n't know ? "
[635/1000]	the general lifted an eyebrow at this . ' just so it could . ' ' and how 'd you know you recognized one ? you 've all been watching me too much to be so sure you were
[636/1000]	was n't that more important ? was n't it more important to make sure that i did n't fail her ? " how about we just go to your place and get you put on meds ? " he
[637/1000]	" sorry , " i said . i 've had to keep my face blank as i kept my eyes on dad and walked toward him , my hand out to his . " come on , uncle ralph
[638/1000]	all right , fine , so i still was n't ready to go that far . i just could n't . and not just any farther . so i made a secret trip to the grocery store to
[639/1000]	she was n't going to think about that just yet . " i can talk to hannah and try to get the files to you with her name on them . " " do n't do that , "
[640/1000]	" how many ? " he asked . " nine . " he held up a hand . " did n't we bring you with us ? " the other three men nodded in agreement .
[641/1000]	" well he will come , you know . you 're looking good of it . " " yeah , but maybe not as good as you . " " oh , come on , you 've still
[642/1000]	" we . " he looked at me now , eyes a deep , dark brown , eyes i 'd heard about , eyes that searched the darkest places of the night for danger and people i never could
[643/1000]	" did she say when she 'd see you again ? " " no . " " did she say when you 'd see her again ? " i shrugged and ran my hands through my hair
[644/1000]	" sure , honey , " martha said with a wink . " she really does . like an old friend of mine called about you once , the famous hollywood star let . heard the girl was a little
[645/1000]	" and just what do you think it should be ? " i look up at her . i can really see the question looming over her . she 's hoping that i 'll tell her . " i
[646/1000]	<EOS> but this only makes me nervous . you know what i really think when i turn on the monitor ? about everything that 's happening . i do this for a lot of reasons . most of
[647/1000]	" the red is a blood oath , " the captain said . he turned his attention to me . " i have been a bit too informal with you , captain . i am sorry . "
[648/1000]	this is it for you , you 're getting the truth from me , this is the moment from hell . i need you right now . she walked over to him , threw herself into his arms and
[649/1000]	he nodded and left . so , he wanted his daughter . he wanted - hell . he could n't just take her . so was he going to have to kill somebody else ? a little
[650/1000]	now , though , i could only imagine that i was n't going to like this version of the story as it unfolded . " so you have to be this kid 's friend , yet it turns out
[651/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " she said again . " i need just a few minutes . " but it was too late . he was on his feet . he looked through the peephole . his wife
[652/1000]	" yes , my lord , " was all he would say . " i will make this as simple as i can , your highness , before we embark on the voyage . " " very good
[653/1000]	she did n't want to sound bitter , but she was . " i 'm sure . " she took that last gulp of her champagne on a sigh and put the glass on the bar . she hated that
[654/1000]	her body was still tense on the horse , but when he stood to take her reins instead , and she fell in step beside him , he got the feeling she was actually too nervous . it did n't
[655/1000]	why not ? what she should do was run . she could pretend it 'd been her husband that killed her , or she could give in and be grateful . <EOS> and thought about that . rather
[656/1000]	i stare at him . " you thought it would have been easier to just find me somewhere , but now <EOS> and you 're just looking at the house and taking pictures like you 're supposed to . "
[657/1000]	my cell filled with a handful of the same number as two of my colleagues from the team . the message had been sent two hours ago . now i had just half an hour to read it .
[658/1000]	" can we go back into here now ? " i asked . it continued to sway in the shadow of the tree , like a large dark bird perched on the roof of the cavern . "
[659/1000]	" well , i do n't think you can call me a liar , " he said as he took a step in my direction . i had to look up quickly to keep from being blinded by surprise .
[660/1000]	" i never saw any reason , " i said softly . we did n't touch , but it was as close as two people could be <EOS> three months ago . " they did n't know why i
[661/1000]	" shit . " the word came out in a furious rush . he slammed a hand against his sternum . " what is this ? you want to blame me ? ! you bitch ! " she glanced
[662/1000]	i shrugged . " no . " james smiled . he had a light in his eyes he was going to hide behind now , but it was there anyway . without warning , he grabbed my hand and
[663/1000]	he had lived in a house so small he had no idea that it was actually not made of wood but of marble . huge floors and glass walls . it might have been called a castle , would have
[664/1000]	the waiter showed up , placing glasses full of beer and ice - filled plastic cups in front of the old man . " here you go , sir . i hope you do n't mind . " he said
[665/1000]	but it was n't the only change that changed - there 's something else about that guy as well . one of the vampires in front of them began to move from behind the couch , his whole body turned
[666/1000]	" so ? " " so , he is telling the truth at this moment . and if i have to risk a few life sentences by killing my partner , then do n't underestimate the power of justice
[667/1000]	" i know , " he purred . " but i 'm here to help you . go on . " his words were sincere . she could see it , see it . not even he paid his
[668/1000]	he could not understand her anger with him . " of course , he would have been worried about you . but he 's still alive , your family will be . you must n't forget that . "
[669/1000]	the air was thick with steam . for a moment , she struggled to breathe in it . her eyes must have widened . he 'd scared her . " w - what are you w - going to
[670/1000]	the demon , still leaning more or less over me , began choking me from behind in a low , vile voice . this time , i gagged , but it still kept me pinned to the bed and kept
[671/1000]	the guard had n't been moving yet . he turned toward the door , reaching down to push back the bars . " that 's not your first priority , " jude told him , voice just as mild
[672/1000]	the girl in question was so young . a tall , slender woman like herself . her light brown hair was long and perfectly tailored . she had a youthful body . the thing she must have meant was
[673/1000]	" and you should definitely find the first available hotel . " he leaned down , nuzzled her neck , then pulled her into the arms of his brother before her protest could form . standing , she was suddenly
[674/1000]	" is there anyone else you can drop from the ceiling ? " he asked . i laughed . " i 'm not a gymna st . i 'm stronger than most humans , have to be , to
[675/1000]	" so much for my friend 's good intentions , " adam growled . as they passed through the front gates of his home , his mother nodded toward the guard posted outside . two guards and a woman
[676/1000]	" he 's been a good boy . i know he is . so , your life here is a very quiet one . everyone here knows , and i 'll be happy to give you a few things to
[677/1000]	i sat . i 'm sure that was a very dramatic statement to make . " you 're right , she was probably out with my neighbors , and probably was just helping old man macallister get through . apparently
[678/1000]	" not one of them had been around , and the smell of their sweat was making it difficult to tell which was which . when i began to smell the vomit , the feeling i got after i realized
[679/1000]	" a little too much wine will do you good , my girl . " his grandmother lifted a hand to her brow and chuckled self - consciously . " not that you even drink , although you must admit
[680/1000]	" is it okay that i 'm here ? " " i 'll never get used to being without you , " he says . i lean in once more and open my mouth to say something else
[681/1000]	" fuck ! what did the woman have to do to make you all go like this ? ! " simon seethed . " listen ! i 'm not in any position to discuss this . but i asked
[682/1000]	" you must help them , " she pleads . " please help them get past him . " " why would i ? " i turn to look at her . " that means they do n't know
[683/1000]	but the thought of leaving her and her home made his hands clench in painful reaction . " i wo n't leave , " he said , his voice a guttural growl . she laughed shakily . if she
[684/1000]	" do n't worry dear , it ca n't be that bad . in time , after the old days it will become something of an issue . " " you seem like a very nice man . i
[685/1000]	" i do n't think so , " eric says , still standing as tall as he can . " you said you were a fairy . " " well , i am . " the answer is n't
[686/1000]	" what ? " she asked . he stared down at her . " you think it 's still funny ? " " it 's a pretty safe bet . " his mouth curved , the full
[687/1000]	" i would n't be here if he had n't had so much faith in me , " i replied , trying to sound flippant . " i think we 're doing fine . i mean , i know
[688/1000]	she gasped , then held her breath . but she could n't call for help , was n't sure if he really was n't there , and she was n't sure if she wanted to see him again .
[689/1000]	" are you sure ? " she moved over that last time and sat astride his waist . " your scent always drives me crazy . " " is that saying anything ? " he swallowed
[690/1000]	" are you sure ? " the answer arrived very succinctly . " very sure . the reason her throat was slit is due to the vampire . she 's a victim . " adrien 's throat constricted
[691/1000]	" is he with you ? " " did you tell him ? " he nodded . " and when he asked how come i did n't know , i did n't have an answer . " he
[692/1000]	the two other officers had been sitting alone . as they watched silently , two men came into the room , both of them dressed in identical clothes : plain shirts and slacks , both looking uncomfortable . both had
[693/1000]	" well ... i mean , i really was n't aware the idea of being a ... a man was true , " jeff stuttered , " but i 'm still shocked when it 's not . so i might
[694/1000]	" yes , we 're good at that , " ian replied . he would n't tell her his brothers ' names , but knew she assumed they were members of the same group . the man was probably telling
[695/1000]	" i will be waiting , " he said and rose to his feet , " i have to move quickly . " she frowned and said , " i 'm going with you , though . "
[696/1000]	" i do n't want to . " " then i 'm staying here . you too . " the statement came out of nowhere , and it was directed at her . she went to turn away
[697/1000]	" i 'm not leaving . " " i 'll walk you out . " i can hear her breathing change and she tightens her grip on my arm . " no . you ca n't you hear
[698/1000]	" i was waiting for you , " he said from behind her . she froze at the sight of him . this man had never really been in her life , but right now he was filling
[699/1000]	" i 'm happy , " emma sighed . as the silence increased , she wondered if she should have been the one to cut the tension . but after another hundred questions , she settled for , " <EOS>
[700/1000]	" you do understand , do n't you ? " she looked up at him , a bit confused . " that you do n't know who he is , even though you have known him all of
[701/1000]	her father gave the sign for the room , put out an arm and guided her in . he was wearing plain blue jeans , boots , vest and a black t - shirt at the same time . an
[702/1000]	she moved her arms to loop around my neck , and i lifted her right foot away from the table until she could n't move her hands up to stop me . the scent of her arousal was irresistible
[703/1000]	with that my attention was torn from his words as there was a knock at the door . in a matter of a few seconds , it was answered . " hello , is there anything i can do for
[704/1000]	" you want to talk about , then ? " " nothing ! " said his wife . " let 's just put it to the side . i came here for a reason . " her eyes
[705/1000]	chapter 44 in the moonlight , i could see the way it moved around him , the smooth , pale skin , his face and the muscles of his shoulders and chest . his breathing was more ragged than
[706/1000]	" just going to hold you to that , " hunter replied . they walked for a few more minutes before they reached the end of the alley . hunter was surprised , and watched as a group of
[707/1000]	" in all fairness , " kresh said in exasperation , " i am not so easily offended . people are too good - spirited to have to endure the ridicule of such words ! " " i am
[708/1000]	he watched her as if assessing her response and wished he knew at least a little more about her , until she finished brushing her teeth and turned down the overhead light . he was almost relieved when she stood
[709/1000]	" i just figured we need to meet here one day , maybe for dinner , " she said as he stepped out of the cab . he shook his head . " i wish we could get together
[710/1000]	he looked up , and there were tears in his eyes as they met mine . i started to choke , and i did n't try to fight the tears . " please , lana . " he pulled
[711/1000]	" not only that i wish i could go back to the great cave as soon as possible , but i feel so ... empty inside . " she stopped again and looked out into her room . i felt
[712/1000]	" i can , " i admitted softly . " but i hate that we need that much practice when i already know what i want . " i stared into his eyes , the way his eyes fixed
[713/1000]	" how was the show ? " she asked . she had , for lack of better words , a hard time making herself talk . " how 's the house coming ? " " fine , " he
[714/1000]	the first time he 'd seen the man , he 'd been convinced that he was in a horrible place that they called hell . he 'd seen a man with skin as brown as the floor and a heart
[715/1000]	she did n't even try to tell him that her life required something more substantial from her than a simple marriage proposal . as if she would ever have her own life . in any case , he would n't
[716/1000]	" yes . " she stood at the end of the hallway to look in on her roommate . rachel was on her phone for the millionth time with tara , a true aunt , and soon to be a
[717/1000]	i nod , and then he 's hugging me , kissing my cheek . " i love you , livie . i 'm proud of you . " " i love you too , dad . " he
[718/1000]	" well , yeah . someone is a fool . they 're all that 's left . " the old man was trying hard to sound knowledgeable , but it came out sounding more like a plea rather than a
[719/1000]	i grinned , but there was something in the way that gabriel had done the act of holding my hand made me wonder if he would say it if i asked him . " so what about your past
[720/1000]	' are n't you just dying to know ? ' he demanded incredulously . ' yes . ' she gave him a pained look . ' are you really dying to know ? ' she knew the answer before
[721/1000]	and there is no truth in what they make you do until they make you do it . " ethan stood and turned to look at me . his jaw clenched , and his hands gripped the edges of
[722/1000]	the people in the lobby were too fascinated to notice . " you should n't drink so much bourbon , darling , " said one member of the room . " the people want it even more . this
[723/1000]	" you guys all right . " they seemed to be fine . she thought . " you think he 's okay ? " " he 's still in good shape . but i think we have
[724/1000]	" a book , for sure . i bought one from the university bookstore at the mall on west broadway . it 's really good . i 'll read it to you . " the last bit was spoken
[725/1000]	his stare was flat and empty . " all that 's left to do is wait . " she stared at him for a second then turned to leave him . and then , just as she was
[726/1000]	" and how did you get out ? " " just as i expected . " this was not good . " and how soon do i have to leave ? " " let me think ?
[727/1000]	" well enough . i have my mother to thank for that . " " that must have been pretty frightening for poor sarah , her sister dying . " henry shrugged . " it certainly was .
[728/1000]	" yes . " he closed his eyes ; it was strange to hear the sound of his voice even though he was at once very much glad the place was deserted . it was a bit easier to be
[729/1000]	" yeah , well i know you - we 're different . we 're not a single person . " the smile drops from his face . " she took a fall and was probably in shock . you
[730/1000]	he knew he was hurting her , that she needed to open up to him for it ... but every minute he stood between her and safety , he grew more and more consumed with the need to make her
[731/1000]	* * * i 'd started it an hour ago , but it was n't enough . she was on the couch , sitting with her arms wrapped around her knees while she took deep , shuddering breaths and
[732/1000]	" really ? in what way ? " " your soul . " her heart skipped a beat . did she really need to guess what that meant ? " your girlfriend would be surprised to hear that
[733/1000]	" he must have thought he knew , " said his cousin . " i told him that our people have no honor . if he thought that he could control the mountain and this place , i would lose
[734/1000]	but she could n't handle being alone out there . not now . " i 'm sorry . i ca n't sleep . oh , i know it 's late , " she said , the way it should have
[735/1000]	" what 's that , honey ? " " the water 's cold . i need to turn off the heater . " " here . " he pulled a water bottle from the bedside table . "
[736/1000]	" do n't look at me , " i said , watching him pull a book toward him . " when do you get your car ? " " about four weeks from tuesday . " " what
[737/1000]	" it took one look at him with her face and my heart literally stopped , " she admitted . " if she 'd told me of this , it could only have been because she did n't know that
[738/1000]	' yeah , she did . ' he grinned , even if it had n't been his favorite topic . ' wow . ' melody 's eyes shone with enthusiasm . ' and now i 'm sure your dad
[739/1000]	" what kind of deal is going on with those things ? " i asked . " one . we do n't want the reboots coming back . " " did they realize this did n't work out
[740/1000]	" you 'll need to sit <EOS> back . the rest of the time is up to you . " a hard flight , but i managed to work at least two weeks after that . i was relieved
[741/1000]	" no , " he said . she smiled at him and took his jacket from him and he nodded to himself . she put it on her own shoulders , and it was n't until she 'd crossed
[742/1000]	i could n't take my eyes off him , so i brought my knee up , bringing him in deeper , filling myself completely with him . he moaned , and his hands lifted to my head , locking
[743/1000]	the guards turned , but from where i was on a wall , i could n't determine anything about his appearance . " he is a man of my acquaintance , " the guard said . " his name
[744/1000]	" what does she say ? " the priest asks through his full lips . god . i ca n't remember just now if i still saw lucy . " my mom can tell you that . "
[745/1000]	' with the help of the guards , mr chancellor , we 'll have the ship out to the sea in another week , perhaps so , but the navy ca n't afford the cost of time . '
[746/1000]	" not even after my mother 's death , " she added in a small voice . " it still seems like a mistake , " he said . " and you did look at the map before ,
[747/1000]	" that 's what i 'm afraid of , " the old man answered , as he stepped out from behind the door , carrying a lantern . " she 's been sent here . " " sent where
[748/1000]	' i see . ' he sounded subdued ( if barely ) . ' no , we 're okay to take care of it here . thanks , though . now that we think we saw something ... '
[749/1000]	she stared at him . and then , with a sigh , turned away . chapter 2 the sound of rain pat tered faintly on the roof of the shed outside and the rain pounded the tin roof
[750/1000]	" yes , i 'm on my way . " " thanks dear . " " what do you need ? " " i 'm on the way to the hospital . a friend that saw me
[751/1000]	" you 're scaring me , " i whispered . " what 's happening ? are you a vamp or a warlock ? " he laughed . " wait ' til you meet some of my family . "
[752/1000]	" yes , " she said . they walked to an empty porch and she went up the steps . " i ca n't believe you 're here , " she said to michael . " but i
[753/1000]	the young man , with his wild hair and rugged beard , stared at one of the dead , struggling to struggle to get back to life . " but it 's just going to be one of them ,
[754/1000]	" you know , when we were boys , i would read to harry during the day and he 'd sneak down to the kitchen and read to me at night . i 'd pretend to read to him until
[755/1000]	and in this way , i 'm just one part of this life : " here 's what will happen . i 'm not sure there is anything left for you since it was your brother he killed .
[756/1000]	" okay . one question though . " i said . " who 's going to become a vampire first , and how do we know for sure that it 'll be you ? " my heart continued to
[757/1000]	" i wonder how the rest of my body will be going out this morning , " kira stated . " i 'll go and put it on . you should go get the rest in , too ,
[758/1000]	the captain , who was waiting outside the door , opened it wide enough to let us in . we had been planning on sitting outside the door for quite some time , but since there was no one
[759/1000]	" what 's your favorite color ? " " lemon yellow ! " she shouted out . the group , along with the other staff , cheered and clapped . my heart soared like the helium on a helium
[760/1000]	" wow . a few times over , but i thought you knew . " " well , someone has found out what i do for a living . and i do n't have to tell you how happy
[761/1000]	" what ? " simon said . " i said , what ? no . no , i do n't understand . give it to me straight . no ? no . it must be in the paper ?
[762/1000]	" yeah . " " okay , i 'll work for what i can make . do n't ask me more about the rest or i 'll have to answer some questions for you . it 's more fun
[763/1000]	" hello , " she says from behind the veil of a veil . she 's wearing a knee - length skirt with a cream cashmere sweater over it and a long - sleeved white robe . her hair is
[764/1000]	" i feel lost , " i said , my sorrow growing with each sound , every thought . " i 'm confused . if you 're here for the end of the world , why not sit here with
[765/1000]	" i do n't know . i do n't have id . " " i 'm sorry , i ca n't help you there , but i can give you a description and a description and where you could
[766/1000]	i saw the image of a young man with his arm around one of the nuns , a single knife pressed against the skin at the other side of her throat . then i saw him swallow her . i
[767/1000]	" yes , mr. le sade . i had no reason to delay . i was certain i could convince you of the contrary and make an example of you upon my home planet . " " huh ?
[768/1000]	i was n't even in the mood for a fight right now . so i let it go . * * * ten minutes later , the clock showed five till ten . i 'd taken a shower
[769/1000]	she stared at me , not quite sure what i 'd done to win her over . " let 's get you home , " i said . i guided her out of the hotel lobby . i
[770/1000]	it would be like the one to say you can have a life without death , but you have to be reborn to do it . when you finish a work , you have to go to hell for being
[771/1000]	" and how long have you known me ? " he inquired . " just a little while , " i hesitated . i had no idea what the real reason i did this . he was a little
[772/1000]	" so what have i done ? " i muttered . " you did n't do anything , you just got too sick , " mom replied but i kept muttering because she was right . i 'd been
[773/1000]	the world , what the hell . finally , he reached his point - blank spots and looked over his shoulder . and gasped . and fell to his knees . holy crap . everything
[774/1000]	i shake my head at him and put my fork down , then give him my full attention . " have you done this often ? " his smile softens . " no , just once . "
[775/1000]	" that 's kind of you to say , but i have n't thought about it that way . " just say yes . say your thoughts out loud . " oh yeah ? " she said in a
[776/1000]	there were a few cars in the lobby , and i figured that since i had n't ordered all of the food just yet , i 'd starve before i was ready to eat it . i made my
[777/1000]	" you have to eat , " her mom chimed in , her fingers hovering over the rim of her glass . sara looked up from eating a small bite of pizza and stared at her mom for a minute
[778/1000]	his smile stretched in his face . " with a little help from the sisters ... " he gestured toward the kitchen table , where the three nuns were already eating . " i have come to talk about the
[779/1000]	" a boy . " she said quietly . i could see how this thing must be turning into a real nightmare . " i 'm just asking , " i said , as i got up slowly
[780/1000]	all i love about my job is my relationship with you . it keeps a lid on what is being said . and for that , i want a heart - to - heart . i love your work ,
[781/1000]	this should be interesting , sarah thought . did n't my own poor mother do this ? tell me about this dream . did i have a premonition or is this an omen of something else . she watched
[782/1000]	" i thought as much . it 's all just your dream . but here i am in a dream , and she just kept telling me to wake up , to wake up , and ... " "
[783/1000]	he lifted his head and looked down in dismay at the contents of my purse . something within the drawer of his desk reflected an in duc ement he could not resist . a bottle of prescription pills .
[784/1000]	he wanted her ; her blood would be ready for him . he 'd marked her and he 'd come to her . she sighed as she touched the front of her shirt . shit . she 'd made
[785/1000]	" how about getting to know each other better ? " he called , and he realized that he was taking his hand away from her body . he took his hand out again . " are you ready to
[786/1000]	" i 'm your guardian , " the angel began . " i 've been trying to see about the portal as long as i could . i remember the darkness all those years ago and i could just see
[787/1000]	" is that so ? " " yeah . my father worked in the city but also ran a security company there too . " " do you think he 's a retired con man ? "
[788/1000]	she was dressed for bed and was sitting cross - legged on the bed when he joined her . her face was pink with exertion and her eyes were shining . " were you trying to get rid of
[789/1000]	i do n't even get the chance to see who it is before she 's in her car again . it takes me three short seconds before i hear a crunching at a speed that goes beyond the normal speed
[790/1000]	" they 're very sweet , and they 're such good friends , " said beth proudly . " well is n't girls not supposed to want to win ? " the agent spoke impatiently . " not
[791/1000]	" i 'll be all right . " now what ? i took a shuddering breath and pushed away the feeling of helplessness and vulnerability . " we 'll never know , wo n't ever know , will
[792/1000]	the light from the street lamps illuminated an area with many graves in a row . the oldest on the left stood out as a large burial ground , but my curiosity was killed when i realized why .
[793/1000]	" then we 'll just pick up where we left off . " he leaned his body flush with hers again and nuzzled her neck . " mmm , you smell just like your mother did when she was
[794/1000]	i put the phone up to my ear . " hello ? " " hello , " said a male voice . one i recognized . " may i speak to ms. murphy ? this is officer rogers
[795/1000]	as the horse passed out into the traffic jam of pedestrians moving along the road , jamie caught a glimpse of the man who 'd shot at him on the far side of the bridge . he was walking slowly
[796/1000]	and neither had he , in a way . in a way , though , he had wanted her . his hands had been strong , just as so many males had been on his way in after her
[797/1000]	i said , " why are you still here , then ? your grandfather 's house gives you a lot of access to her . " " not in a really good way . who can understand how she
[798/1000]	he heard music in the background . someone on the phone . he thought the voices were coming from an elevator . " well , go ahead , " he said to the person on the other end .
[799/1000]	her expression softened as she looked at me . " so then what happened ? " " i took off running . at first i had no idea where i was going or how i got there . the
[800/1000]	" you know , " she said . " as soon as i got here , i stopped by the office and saw you sitting there . you were in deep shit . but i was tired and wanted to
[801/1000]	" how is she ? " " she 's fine . she 's got a concussion and a dislocated shoulder , but she should be fine . " for the first time , he glanced around the living room
[802/1000]	' thank you , sir , ' came the reply . ' now you say yourself , how did you get the man to release you ? ' ' by having a pair of hands pressed against the wall
[803/1000]	" sure . i should be inside . " he stepped out after the other man . i moved to the side to allow trent time to gather some clothes . i hoped we 'd be able to get
[804/1000]	" i will . just send any guards who look like they represent law enforcement to let me through , along with the members of the commission , " gabriel replied . gabriel 's door opened and a figure
[805/1000]	" i 'd better go , " i told him , and glanced through the peephole . " nick is getting ready ... are n't you ? or you 're just wasting your time . do me a favor .
[806/1000]	" if you trust me , i ca n't tell you what to do . i can sense your aura . it is very strong , i gather . once i ca n't describe to you how much i hate
[807/1000]	it was almost like an angry panther , rearing and pushing against him . he spun onto his back . he braced himself as the creature stepped close , ready to strike . the thing roared . chapter
[808/1000]	she looked at me sheepishly , obviously not having understood my tone . i took a deep breath and let it out slowly . " what you want is n't impossible , " i insisted and then added
[809/1000]	" hey , " she answered in a breathy voice . " i do n't know what the hell you were doing at eddie 's , but you looked completely taken aback . " she said nothing for
[810/1000]	" you know , the first day at the mall , when you asked me to go to the dance with you , i agreed . " his eyes widened as he recalled that day - what he had done
[811/1000]	i nod my head then press my hand deeper into his . and then he starts whispering . and it feels insanely nice . i close my eyes , the heat of his voice melting away everything that
[812/1000]	she looked at me , surprised . she said something and whispered , but i was too entranced by the picture of her to listen . now she was holding with the other hand a hand full of what appeared
[813/1000]	' yes , of course . ' ' anyway , ' she said , ' you 'll be leaving for the country in a day or two , but i trust that you 'll be back before evening .
[814/1000]	" i do n't like the idea of sharing you with others , " she said . she had never experienced such devotion with anyone before , and it was new and alarming . " i doubt he 'll appreciate
[815/1000]	" the name 's marcus deluca ! " i shouted , turning around in my seat and letting out a squeal . standing in my doorway was the most damn beautiful man i 'd ever seen . " marcus
[816/1000]	" what is it now ? " " i do n't know . i wo n't always see it , " she whispered . " but i know someone who does . " chapter twenty - four
[817/1000]	" just talk about anything . just not about me . " " okay . now you are being weird . " " you 're being weird . " " i 'm being a vampire . "
[818/1000]	" they certainly have some good points . " once they reached the bar , a pair of bartenders manned the place and they caught sight of alex and alex and each of them rolled their eyes slightly .
[819/1000]	that brought us toward the first thing . we had worked our way around the garden 's perimeter , finding the stone archway that led back to the kitchen . ' here ! ' said the knight , springing
[820/1000]	" what does it feel like ? i mean , my mom died when i was twelve . do they grow wings ? " " no . not wings , " she said , her head shaking back and
[821/1000]	" thanks for the tip , " said tom , " be safe and safe and safe ? " " always , " it replied . i had n't paid much attention to the birds or to the road
[822/1000]	" all the way , " she said , her voice so faint i thought i could hear her from miles away . not wanting to lose her , i followed her to where the crowd had parted and
[823/1000]	" there 's not much , " grace told her . " there may be more , " grace said quickly . " i 'm not even sure i want to know . will you come to dinner tomorrow
[824/1000]	" oh , i 'm fine . just be there in five minutes , " i said , smiling . " we do n't have time for family dinners and family dinners . " he laughed . " fine
[825/1000]	i 've never met anyone like him before . and my heart wants to open its eyes and see him like he 's never been . to be let , so completely , completely free from the darkness . the
[826/1000]	there was nothing else . but the way she looked at him was almost the same . he felt his gut tighten , and knew she was seeing the same expression on his face that he was looking for .
[827/1000]	" i ca n't get it right . " she looked at me as she leaned toward the computer . " there will be no answers for me , " she continued . " in fact , i 've been
[828/1000]	if all this had n't been so ridiculous , and i did n't really believe it , i probably would have been sick . but these thoughts did n't matter . eotdelim 1 " the one with the
[829/1000]	" only so much , " the woman said . " it wo n't buy us much time , " shallan said . " if <EOS> all that 's left . " " they are very hard but
[830/1000]	" hey ! it 's not a big deal ! " " stop this . i ca n't be here , in this house , " said brian , looking down at the ground . " it 's
[831/1000]	" go ahead . anything 's mine . " " it was n't you , " she said . she put on a more soothing voice . " i 'm sure that was someone else . perhaps this is
[832/1000]	" and she does n't deserve you . " " i 'm not going to get caught , " she said , her voice soft , trying to convince me of that . " if that 's the case
[833/1000]	a moment later , ryan put his glass down and took a deliberate step forward . " hello , gorgeous , " he said softly . she was instantly on high alert , knowing that she was about to
[834/1000]	" hey ! my sister likes you , too . " the crowd laughed and shouted their affection when they were the only ones listening to my story . i think every single person even smiled . " my
[835/1000]	" go on . " " i hate to be a voyeur , but i did n't see anything - nothing at all . i mean , it 's too dark . i do n't think i caught anything
[836/1000]	the second i 'm in front of him , i take his hand and guide him toward the elevator . he stops when the doors close , and i feel his gaze burn over my face . i can already
[837/1000]	" good idea , " said daniel . " you must have a lot of ideas , " said daniel . he smiled . " and they usually include the three of us , " said daniel
[838/1000]	she 'd felt guilty for doing the same thing , did n't want to burden either one of us by making promises she could n't keep . as he looked back at her , she did n't look guilty .
[839/1000]	" you always get your way , " she admonished him . " and do n't you dare take your hands off me . " she thought he would n't but saw the smile in his eyes as he
[840/1000]	" i 'm here to help her , " i say , and this time it 's dr. harris who nods . " in fact , i 'm the one with her . why do n't you stay with her
[841/1000]	another smile . " there 's a catch . " " what does that mean ? " " we 've discussed the problems that you 're experiencing . " " yeah . i 'll let you figure
[842/1000]	' no , not just that . i mean someone else . somebody outside of the family . ' ' like my sister ? i go to sleep sometimes . ' ' how old is she ? '
[843/1000]	there is a dull boom of steel on steel , but no explosion . the guard throws down his gun and i grab his gun and press it against his forehead . bam . it 's one
[844/1000]	" i 've never been . " " well , you 'll be in time for the party , " she said quickly . " well , do n't you feel sick ? " " a little
[845/1000]	the woman 's face reddened at the rebuke . " my husband is in town at the moment , but until he is , i 'll be staying with my aunt ida . " ida ida ? i shook
[846/1000]	" i 'm asking . " i know what he 's going to ask , and it 's no good . not this time . " there 's a bunch of people we 'd like to meet . "
[847/1000]	" ah , now that i think about it , " i ventured , " you said you and your boys had already met . " she got a faraway look <EOS> kind of a joke . " i
[848/1000]	he shook his head . " she looks like we belong together . " he smiled again . " thanks . i got ta be able to concentrate . so if you do n't mind , who is
[849/1000]	' yes , ' he said . at first there had been no sound . once they heard that sound , their concentration became on the front doors , which stood in empty slots in the pavement . a
[850/1000]	with his last bullet , joe watched his body be blown apart , saw the black smoke rise off the red of his burning body , felt the air drain from his lungs , and saw his heart burst as
[851/1000]	he frowned and rubbed through his hair . " damn it . we had good sex on the lawn . why 'd you drag me into this ? " she shrugged . " well , i figured it was
[852/1000]	he pulled me into his arms . " no , the two of you are enough for me . i do n't need anybody else . " our lips pulled apart . i had n't meant to say it
[853/1000]	" yeah , but it was the middle , the middle of the night . i guess the landlord would have come to investigate the noise . she was nice to me and everything . i stopped being mad at
[854/1000]	" i love you , too , " i said . " do me a favor . " before i could say anything , he touched my face with the pad of his thumb . " try her
[855/1000]	by the time we 'd stopped for tea a large crowd had gathered around . they were a long line of people , waiting for an opening . " i thought we 'd go to the river and sit
[856/1000]	" you have nothing to worry about . " he says in a gruff tone . he puts a hand on my back and lead me back inside , but his words are still held back by his words .
[857/1000]	they both turned their heads at the same time and saw him coming toward them . john 's face split into a brilliant grin and he offered his hand . he took her hand in his and shook it
[858/1000]	she heard herself sigh . " okay , okay , i 've got it . give me an hour . " " but ... " he hesitated , as if he was uncomfortable with the choice . "
[859/1000]	' are you sure you 're interested in my advice ? ' said lord vetinari . ' there is some time ahead to - ' he cut himself off as sir reynold took the cup from him and
[860/1000]	the phone rang exactly two minutes after seven . it was n't even ten o'clock , yet it had him wondering if something was wrong . he picked up the phone before he realized what he was about
[861/1000]	" hey ! " i scream , reaching for my glass of milk . " you 've given me an iced tea - on the house ! jesus , look what that did to you ! " i wipe
[862/1000]	" they need a lot of help , " i murmured back . a soft chuckle came from the other side of the bar . " i 've had enough experience to tell you you can have all the
[863/1000]	i would have gotten to her in time ; that is what my brain had said . but i would not have known what to do , because i would have been unable to help my own parents .
[864/1000]	" your phone rang only twice . and besides , there was a woman with the same name in the grocery store . " " why did you call me ? " " i thought you might have
[865/1000]	" did you know that they let you in ? " " just me . " " and i do n't suppose you have any questions for them ? " " can you send the police out
[866/1000]	" i do n't know how to make it better , " kylie said , and tears were in her eyes . " i know , but i know , and trust me , that it 's worse if
[867/1000]	" it had a price . what were you , a woman ? " not that he would ever say such a thing to a woman . " no . " " surely the gods did n't mean
[868/1000]	' no , ' i say shortly . ' i 'm dead . and although it 's one in the morning , i 'm still alive . ' he drops his forehead on my nose . ' are you
[869/1000]	" for what ? " " i was sent to find you . " she took a sip of her lemonade . a moment later , she handed him back the cup . " who sent you ?
[870/1000]	" that 's a nice thought , " nick said . " but i do n't think it will work . he 's too good at saying what he means . he 'll lose his shit when he sees that
[871/1000]	i could feel the tension pulsing in my gut . " i 'll talk to him , " he promised , but his tone was curt . that was n't good . the guy was a little too pissed
[872/1000]	i 'd forgotten all - which meant that he had too . well , he had . even though things had been strained between us ( albeit with a very small amount of progress ) , i 'd been with
[873/1000]	" so , do you see the point at all of this ? " he asked . he reached behind him and pulled out a large white envelope , like something out of a spy novel . he tossed it
[874/1000]	" well , " he said , " one could say i was not an expert on his own part . " " oh ? " " no , he was a ... " " a ...
[875/1000]	she waited for a reaction . some little one that would ask for reassurance she would n't be crying or screaming . he let out a laugh of pure joy , one that pulled at his heart . "
[876/1000]	" i did , but i was in such a hurry to get back to the hotel that i did n't even think of you . i wish i could change that . " " i wished i could
[877/1000]	" what are you two doing out here ? " asked alex . " we came back from an important mission , " said peter with a look of concern on his face . " we 've been ordered
[878/1000]	" my dear ! " his grandmother chided him . " do not let your wounds heal so quickly . there is a great difference , you know . " " but i thought we needed to bring him
[879/1000]	" do ... you have any idea who i know ? " he asked , meeting her gaze . " i 've never met his father . " it had n't occurred to her that he was the enemy
[880/1000]	so help us , if they learn i 've got the last word , they 'll be wondering what a pair of pants and a flannel shirt fit better around the neck than the pants i 'm wearing .
[881/1000]	i let him slide beneath my shirt . " i know i only have one dress , " i said , " but maybe i could help you with that . " he slid his hands behind his back
[882/1000]	he glanced at her face . they were n't speaking , barely aware of the muted buzz . " yes , the guy who looked into her locker looked into her roommate 's locker . she had n't moved
[883/1000]	" your father , too . but they used a more advanced weapon , a giant knife and i had the pleasure of meeting him . we became friends . " " uncle ! " the toddler had
[884/1000]	" i agree it 's been easier on you while you 've had less responsibility , but i do n't believe it 'll get any easier if you do n't behave . " " you do n't understand .
[885/1000]	she reached up and caught my chin with her fingers . " you 'll be able to read them ... there 's no need to be shy this time . " i turned into her now , burying my
[886/1000]	she sat up , blinking away any lingering dreams . a memory was tugging at the edges of her mind , taunting her until she bit her lower lip to keep it from trembling . not again .
[887/1000]	it was his imagination that conjured the images he sought - images of her nak * d and glistening and drenched in his fluids , of her eyes sparkling with passion , her lips quivering as he thrust his h
[888/1000]	by the time i got back to my desk and found my replacement , liz was standing in the doorway with her arms folded across her chest . she was staring at me as if she could now read my
[889/1000]	" well , my dear , let us never forget it . " the two men talked for the next hour . when they finished , the butler gave them food , and they thanked him for dinner and
[890/1000]	" come on , you 've got no time to die . i doubt this will ever end right this minute , mr. lo ting er . " " no , no , mr. mccarthy , it 's just
[891/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " " i 've never been a dreamer , " she told him , then she pulled back and smiled in the hazy mirror as she ran her palm over her br
[892/1000]	" i do n't believe as much as you , my love , but i do believe you , " he told her . " i know the love you have for your brothers . i know it will always
[893/1000]	" and i should n't have said that , " the boy 's father broke in . " she 's very hot , but to think she almost made it , her eyes were red like a girl in the
[894/1000]	" that 'll be all there is to it , " said one man , and he gave a broad smile . so handsome . yes , handsome . a tall man , with brown hair and large green eyes
[895/1000]	" i have to - " her words were cut off by an explosion of gunfire . a line of smoke burst inches from my nose , filling my vision . i grabbed for the uzi and swung it around

[907/1000]	' no , that 's it sir , ' he replied ' and i 'm afraid it 's not very good , ' added the man sitting across the lobby desk . ' no , no mr sor
[908/1000]	" what ? " i took a bite of my sandwich and picked up my pencil . " it 's a huge world we live in . " he smiled at me as he reached into his pocket and
[909/1000]	" they were both from new mexico . there were two other girls with them . they were dressed the same way . one had black ink all over her legs , and in different colors on her arms ,

[911/1000]	" i noticed on the way in that they did talk to each other , like you just do if you are friends and if we wanted to talk to each other , or if you decided you knew what
[912/1000]	" what in the name of god ! " the king said with a terrible snarl <EOS> ! ( there was a moment , then a third , second , when ralph before he saw him . he was
[913/1000]	he was n't sure why , but it was n't fair to ask him to go if he 'd just ask her . he was beginning to feel like she did n't trust him . he was certain of it
[914/1000]	i can hear our conversation in my mind ; it 's one of her games . she never once raises a hand when i broach the subject . she has her own agenda to keep us in the dark
[915/1000]	i smiled and said , " i would like that , but i like that it is a surprise . " he smiled and said , " so , what are your plans for the day ? "
[916/1000]	" sure , honey , call this in . " he handed the phone over . " the woman 's name is danielle . i 'm just trying to find out any details i can . if you can give
[917/1000]	she nodded and grabbed her purse . " you can come in with us . it 's not much , i promise , but it is okay . it 's not like i live near here , so i doubt
[918/1000]	the other man leaned forward and tried to keep the conversation going as he listened to their side of the story . finally the man said , " so we got no chance to talk . you know -
[919/1000]	' would you rather i had a cup of tea ? ' she asked him . ' you had better have tea , ' he said . miss dun ning was aware that something was up with the

[921/1000]	" he seemed almost ... cheerful , " jo muttered and started to ask how she 'd managed to do that when a door opened behind them . the three of them jumped in surprise at the noise and were
[922/1000]	" do n't bother ! " the dragon roared , lowering her head and spitting out the bones . but the rest of her tail was too thick and it slid out through the crack . she took a few
[923/1000]	and the three were still back in there . if they are really listening . . . " " ok tony , i will go outside in a few minutes . " tony quickly packed as the sun
[924/1000]	" i hate it , " she moaned . " it 's the first day . " she gave him a dazed look . " did n't we pick this place for our dinner ? " she
[925/1000]	a tall lanky boy in a dark tie , striped dress shirt and black blazer approached and opened the elevator for us . " good morning , mr. mal lee , " he said . " this way . "
[926/1000]	their mother returned that same slow , steady walk , as if she were a walking log . what was the matter with her ? she looked as tired as evie felt . evie called for evie to stay
[927/1000]	then , she saw that the two men from her past had gathered behind a massive , wrought - iron gate , as well as the rest of her family . they 'd come to bring her forth . they

[929/1000]	" what it means , " said david , " is that we should see the lab we 're about to visit tomorrow morning , or the next day - it 's really difficult to know in the first place
[930/1000]	" yeah , i do it in our place . " my dad looked in the direction my sister and i were looking and nodded a lot . " you got me an apartment ? " i asked .
[931/1000]	" he 'd like to find out . " " and you 're the logical one to draw him out of the area , just so we can watch him . " she nods . " i guess

[933/1000]	the crowd parted , allowing me a clear vantage of the center of the room . it was a room so crammed that it seemed to swallow us whole . it was a long wooden table , large enough to

[936/1000]	" oh my god , " amanda said , looking sick . then she pulled her cell phone out and called her friend . " we do n't have a minute , we need to call the police . is
[937/1000]	" oh , " i said . " oh , well , i do n't want a job . i was looking for an office job , and here i am . " " i always get a job
[938/1000]	" i know that , " she said . " i 'm not going to try to stop you . if anything happens to this girl , i 'll go crazy . " he looked at his mother who
[939/1000]	" i am . what do you want , doctor ? " she looks away from him . " i want to know when the doctor will be back . we are about to have a baby . i
[940/1000]	" come over here and sit with me , little girl . " " why ? " asked wanda . " i do n't enjoy being watched , " said mr. bo dd ony , who was already

[942/1000]	not long after the announcement , a beautiful young woman approached and asked my grandmother for permission to be involved in the wedding . " oh , well , if i do , you must be sure to visit
[943/1000]	" are you there ? " <EOS> ... " yes . no . " i was going to kill myself . get up , get up , get up , get up . i needed to
[944/1000]	my head snapped up as a faint voice echoed through the chamber . the king 's high - chief raised his hand . " my son ... " " i 'll see to lord y assa p ,
[945/1000]	" what a great point , " ben said , " but i guess you could n't go by yourself . that 's always an option with me . where do you need to be ? " " you
[946/1000]	the answer came to her with surprising clarity . she could n't say no . not now . not in this small hotel . who she thought she could make stay with her had already left . had every
[947/1000]	as she 'd finished her last mouthful , he asked gently , " if we only met , did you still love me ? " she had to sit up and wrap an arm around his back , hugging
[948/1000]	" why , yes , i did . " " and mr. sanchez , why do n't you come with me ? " so we did . ~~~ chapter four han ner was waiting for
[949/1000]	" no , i did . " " but you thought i was a drug user , did n't you ? " " yeah , i did . " " no surprise . you were a drug
[950/1000]	" how is she ? " asked john from behind me . still holding my hand , i smiled . " okay . as far as i can tell , she 's doing well . " " good
[951/1000]	my body relaxes under his touch , and - suddenly - i can take or leave him . " thank you for the ride home . " " nothing in this life is cheap , lady . "
[952/1000]	they both chuckled as they began building on top of the building . about ten minutes later , we said our goodbyes . i walked with gina down to the parking lot where my car and my father 's
[953/1000]	" thanks , " she said , wiping her hands on an apron . " looks like it 's for the best . i 'd hate to hear my work spoiled overnight . " " i hear you 're
[954/1000]	" yes ? " john asked . " i 'm surprised . " " you should be . " john did n't know whether to laugh or be furious . when he did laugh , it was still
[955/1000]	and then my cell phone starts ringing from inside my back pocket . i glance down in time to see my phone blinking back at me . frowning , i see alex 's name on the screen , and i
[956/1000]	" i need to get out of here , " he said , but he had n't quite taken in the view yet . she said nothing . she just watched him , with a warm , pleasant expression
[957/1000]	it could be that something had happened in the past months or years , and i could n't blame myself . if i had n't been so blinded by heartache and anger , i would have forgiven him for it
[958/1000]	she made a noise in her throat and reached out to touch him , then stopped . he had n't meant to hear that sound , had n't expected it , so by stretching out a hand he took
[959/1000]	" no , but i do n't want any of them to be talking to you on the phone . " " why not ? " " i was too upset to sleep , so they brought a
[960/1000]	i wanted to call up the courage to call her , but i did n't . my body did n't trust me to be in this girl 's arms without flinching away . i did n't want to be the
[961/1000]	it was his daughter , not his own . he tried to pull back , but his muscles clenched and his breathing hitched . the pain was unbearable . his mind seemed to have fled . he slumped down
[962/1000]	you got company ! the officer was ordering . the two riders ran up alongside him ; the man appeared to be german . and he was clearly not joking . " i must warn you , sergeant
[963/1000]	" but that 's ridiculous , " she says , though the worry in her voice is clear . i try to pull the blindfold off , but she wo n't let me . she keeps going .
[964/1000]	" so what happened to you and them ? " " just a battle . " she brushed her fingers through his hair . " i lost my head in the battle , but i figured out something interesting
[965/1000]	" there might be , " daniel replied . " it could be good trouble . you know i ca n't be alone . " he patted me on the arm . " just wait here for me ! "
[966/1000]	" do n't you want to know what i 'm seeing ? " cole demands , his face red from crying . " no ! i - i think i 'll never know ! i - i do n't
[967/1000]	his hands were shaky as he turned the ignition key and the mustang purred forward . she pulled in next to him and parked , but did n't start her car . instead she climbed out with a mischievous smirk
[968/1000]	" he 's just ... a bastard , " i said . " say what you 've got to say , " said the man . " the world is not your world , " i answered ,
[969/1000]	that i could remember . my heart leapt with hope . did i ? the idea of never seeing him again was , for a moment , so foreign , surreal , yet so ... real . i did
[970/1000]	" the other girl is a witch , " charlie explained slowly . " something you probably did n't know we were aware of . i 'll make sure she meets you . " " no , we do
[971/1000]	" who , it ? " " no , look around . i want to go for a walk . you do too . " the smile . that was when i realized the seriousness of my situation
[972/1000]	" that 's very ... " he shook his head . " very ... difficult . " i knew i had him stumped , and i went on to explain . " well , the thing is ,
[973/1000]	" yes ? " " you said we could use your cabin as a base ? " " yes . " " if we saw anyone we have to inform them . " " yes .
[974/1000]	why was i telling him what i was ? " no , " i said suddenly . " no , i did n't . i know i did n't . you did n't tell me anything about your life
[975/1000]	he did n't even blink . " i called you the day before yesterday to tell you the news . " he dipped his head so they were eye to eye . " really , baby . "
[976/1000]	" i 'm taking you to the vet in five minutes . " she 'd already made it out to his car . she opened the door as he opened his , ready to hold up her bag or
[977/1000]	" i do not know , " shallan said . " that 's a good question , khar bran th . dalinar is an idiot . i have n't the faintest idea what to say to him . it seems
[978/1000]	" not a lot of people here , " he said . " a year or two after the accident , before we got out of the hospital , we were thinking of renting a condo out by the lake
[979/1000]	" are you saying she does n't love you ? " was this a good idea ? did he think we were crazy ? " fuck , no . she 's pretty damn sure - " jax took
[980/1000]	" you 're not supposed to be here , " an old woman 's voice called . " she 's getting too big ! " the woman looked up , the smile evaporating from her face . she 'd
[981/1000]	after a round of cheering and clapping , i left them to it and headed upstairs to our room , figuring that meant sleeping the day off and feeling fresh . i checked around the room - even the
[982/1000]	" do n't play with that thing ! " i yelled at him . he blinked once , and then set it in an old leather case . " it 's disgusting ! " he looked back at me
[983/1000]	" yeah , it 's his day off . but he was on saturday and i told him i 'd drop him at the office . " there was a sharp rap on my door . " hi ,
[984/1000]	the door opened and a young man shuffled out . he was tall and black , and stood in the corner of the room , a broom handle clutched firmly to his wrist , a paper bag over his head
[985/1000]	his expression was wary and distant , but his deep blue gaze was fully alert . " why do i have the weird sensation that the world is about to end ? " she shrugged . " you
[986/1000]	" are you okay ? " " fine . i came inside to check on him . " he nodded . " he asked for your name . and i have to tell you , mr. gray ,
[987/1000]	" i 'm having an affair with her , " ryan said , pulling herself up with one hand and holding out the other hand to me . i went to him and took his hand . " it
[988/1000]	well , he could have had her , why had n't he moved on ? she was his , and he 'd want her . she was n't going to let him take her the way he wanted too
[989/1000]	" i 'm just kidding , " he said innocently . " they 're all right , thank you very much . " " really , " she said , and the tension in her body relaxed . "
[990/1000]	" i ... i ... i feel just awful , " she stammered . " yeah , me too . " i said . her smile died down , and she looked at the ground , then back up
[991/1000]	if she was n't careful , she was going to catch the rat . she grabbed onto the door handle and opened it a crack . the rat appeared all right , but she slammed it shut again before
[992/1000]	" like a kid in a candy store ? " " like a kid in a candy store . " " that was supposed to be an accident . " " not just an accident . the
[993/1000]	i do n't want you hurt <EOS> right into the one place on the scale . even tonight , when it hits you ... and that will come from things that start with the fact that i need to
[994/1000]	she caught herself . she 'd forgotten . " do n't look so surprised . they all do . they do the same shit , then back down . they did it because it was part of the deal it
[995/1000]	" you should know that she knows that all by herself . " his voice is thick , almost raw . " i know , " i say sincerely . " she 's been through a lot . she
[996/1000]	all the time if possible . he had been playing it off to them , but the truth was he was worried about her . he 'd been watching her around school and had noticed her reaction . "
[997/1000]	she looked up at him . " that sounds really ... really creepy , " she said . " do n't worry . " his smile widened . " i have my own trick . " chapter twenty
[998/1000]	there were about thirty of them . it was impossible not to notice how much of the big city looked the same as when it once stood so close to the ocean . in many ways , it felt the
[999/1000]	" i 'll bring him back for you . " she nodded . " he 'll have to show me how to raise animals . " " he 'll have to stay out of the water , "
