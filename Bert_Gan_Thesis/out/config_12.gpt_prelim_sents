[0/1000]	" you 're a prince inside ? " " we 're a prince through and through ! " he replied cheerfully . " are you ready to fight ? " " and what if i do n't ?
[1/1000]	" that 's one of the reasons i hired her , " she replied . " she 's an assistant . i told her that i did n't know if the business was good enough or not , and she
[2/1000]	" she 's a good one , and she still is . " " i wish you would settle for getting married , " her stepdad said . she laughed , but it sounded forced , forced even
[3/1000]	nick smirked as he turned away from the table . " you know what ? i 'm exhausted . you 're right ; we do need to spend time together soon . " " i hate to say it
[4/1000]	" what about , " i said , " what you want me to help you with , the reason why you 're going to need me ? " " you 're the only person i can trust ,
[5/1000]	i took a deep breath and held on a little tighter . " i knew you 'd come , so it took me almost half an hour to get a hold of you . " i started to hyperventilate
[6/1000]	" i got no idea , " the man said . " and do you know why ? " " because people in japan do n't know the same things in tokyo . they have separate views on
[7/1000]	" i do n't understand , " i said . " what 's going on ? what 's that noise ? " " yeah , how about i make my point , " bob said . " i 'd
[8/1000]	" when ? " " when he took her to the altar today . " john nodded . " he 's ... " qhuinn closed his eyes for a second that was mirrored at the brotherhood 's
[9/1000]	" it 's not my idea . it 's my own . " i said . " oh c'mon , it 's my idea . " she said exasperated with me . " just you tell me what 's
[10/1000]	she was standing next to an old , weathered barn with a sign hung in front . " i like the barn on it . " the barn was dark as night , with big windows looking out onto
[11/1000]	" i do n't think i 'd try to be anyone 's , " i said . he shook his head . " you are pretty damned good for one girl . " i cocked my head .
[12/1000]	" yeah . i 'm sure it did , " he says . i can tell he 's irritated . " will you just try ? " " no , " he says stubbornly . i can
[13/1000]	" tell me about the man whose voice you heard . " " he told me to , " replied the man . " i 'm sorry but you must have a name . not - your name
[14/1000]	" why would he do that ? " asked alex . " i really do n't know and i do n't have a lot of time . we both have to get to the beach before sundown . i
[15/1000]	the two men were almost shoulder to shoulder now , and from somewhere in the darkness i saw that one of their hands clutched a small dagger - nothing there , no bones , no blood , no bone .
[16/1000]	" would that you could , " he says . his words are so soft i almost do n't hear him . so i know he did n't mean what i saw . i had n't seen him
[17/1000]	" you know i was just kidding . i 'd call them , sure , " kate said . " but if it 's their business , then i do n't care . " " i 'm not letting
[18/1000]	" no , but i suppose my lack of experience in handling small - arms is probably more noticeable . i do n't really have any other reason to be a stranger than to see that these are our subjects
[19/1000]	for a long time , they walked , the heat and humidity making it stifling , before they reached a small stand of palm trees . as they stepped onto the path they could hear the distant rustle of leaves
[20/1000]	" what are you doing , son ? " one of the men asked . " i 'm doing what a man should be doing . " dalton ran a hand through his hair and took a drink of
[21/1000]	to be stopped from any pursuit i would have to go out of the bedroom and come up through the stairs . i had no time to dwell on that for at least an hour . one way or another
[22/1000]	" oh ! did you notice the red car outside ? " " what ? " " the red car . " i pointed in my direction then took a giant gulp of my apple sweet .
[23/1000]	but he had no intention of doing anything to undermine her confidence in him . " he mentioned somewhere - " " no . " her forehead wrinkled with concentration as if she were trying to remember . "
[24/1000]	" are n't you cold ? " he asks with concern . " i 've been warm for , i do n't know , ten years , " i say with a smile . he smiles back at
[25/1000]	" i 'm really just here to learn . but i can pay you back anytime , and do n't worry about it . i do n't mind watching you and getting my hopes up . " " thanks
[26/1000]	" do n't start with me , little boy . i 'm about to get another dose of this . " my head felt thick , but i managed to say , " you saw her . you saw
[27/1000]	" but what about today ? " grace pleaded . " we 'll have to see if you decide . " grace stood , leaving the desk behind her . sitting down , she frowned as the questions
[28/1000]	" why ? " she looked up . " because it would make it hard to get to him . and you think she would put him through that ? " " i was n't really questioning a
[29/1000]	" i had better go , but you should come over to my parents ' house and stay the night or i could come along , " said jonathan , just as an idea struck him . " no
[30/1000]	" what 's the matter with you , man ? " " nothing . " when he saw the look in her eyes give away that she already knew , he corrected himself . " yeah , that 's
[31/1000]	he did n't ask her to tell him what had gone down . he said he understood she was n't comfortable with it . " i did n't know about it at first , but i still need her
[32/1000]	" i 'm sure it 's just what they tell you , " ed said to me . " i 'm not so sure . it looks like the company is n't going to lend you out .
[33/1000]	" i 'm afraid it does n't . " he heard a loud thud and felt a jolt through his body making him lose focus . he stared at the spot , still staring . after a few moments
[34/1000]	and she really was the only one this time . " and you have never let anyone in before . " " well , that should tell you i 'm trying . " and he was . this
[35/1000]	" okay . but i 'll have my hands full of your life . " he chuckled . " i do n't think so , mom . she 's the best . " " <EOS> very serious .
[36/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " i asked , feeling like a fool . if it ever got any worse it was going to be worse than that before tonight . " when he had you by
[37/1000]	" she will come . soon . " " just like all the others , " jason remarked . " which is why i warned her to be more cautious , " farfalee said . her eyes seemed
[38/1000]	" yeah , just shut up for a day , " i beg . " i already hate myself for this . " he grins slightly as he pulls my chin up and his lips press against my forehead
[39/1000]	" she was n't your wife . it just ... happened . i told her what i was . she knew ... " he pointed as he tried to recall a few words , which formed a thick band in
[40/1000]	he gave me a smile , and said , " i bet that was a pretty picture . i figured it was only for a moment . " i smiled . " yeah . it was . "
[41/1000]	after everything , the only way to stop this madness was to get out of that room . how could she do that when she was so horrified by what she had witnessed ? god , she knew what she
[42/1000]	" if you 're going to say we 're old people , you might as well get used to it , because i 'm real old . that 's my granddaughter 's way ; i was twenty - two when
[43/1000]	he did n't want me to hear it because then i 'd be sure he was wrong when he said it . no " the boy . " the guy the girl thought he was was . if jude were
[44/1000]	" we sure are , son , " said his father as he waved to the two boys and his mom . a man with graying hair wearing thick glasses and wearing a tight dark suit and a white shirt
[45/1000]	he did n't look up from watching the stars . " no . " she was n't certain what to make of that response . whatever it was , it was strong , bitter , too harsh for the
[46/1000]	" what is the problem ? " mrs. jacob sen demanded . " nothing . " " why did n't you call home ? " becky asked . " i ... uh ... " i stammered awkwardly
[47/1000]	the nurse , at first surprised and unable to see her own hand with her eyes closed , opened them as the ambulance sped past in a blur , and then smiled at me , holding out a hand .
[48/1000]	" but , " i 'm saying , " but - ? " i think about the picture . " but nothing , " dad says . " it 's got nothing to do with any more than you
[49/1000]	" i ... " but the whole time his lips were on mine and my hands were on his t - shirt and i was trembling , i could n't think . his hands were on my waist and my
[50/1000]	how could i make myself believe she had a lover when it was exactly the opposite ? how does one respond to such a thing ? " why are you so upset , harper ? " i just
[51/1000]	" and how is it you got here ? " asked the sheriff so rudely that he almost dropped whatever was in his ear . " uh ... well , " said daniel nervously , " there was a
[52/1000]	what ? the sun was low in the sky when the old man put his hand away from his brow and gave me a sympathetic smile . " sorry about that , " he said . at my
[53/1000]	" what 's the matter with her ? " the man asked . " look on the bright side , mate . she did manage to use her ability on the dead , because i do n't think they
[54/1000]	" yeah . i know from talking with alex , that we can wait . " " thanks . " he smiled . " i hope your dad knows he 's doing the right thing . " she
[55/1000]	" well , we can give you your stuff , " she offers . " thanks , " i say . " and thanks for not leaving me in the car . and for the door . "
[56/1000]	" i 'm still too young for all this , " anna said . " yeah , you 're young just fine . you 're just lucky it does n't appear to be spreading . how are you doing
[57/1000]	" to have money once in a while means not to play ball when the game is all about money . " " you mean they 're good at the game ? " the boy laughed . i got
[58/1000]	you have to help me , he is saying , or we wo n't be able to say no . she says nothing . she is not a complete moron . i had every intention of helping him but my
[59/1000]	" if not , what then ? and why say it ? " i looked at him with my eyebrows raised , taking that in . " i 've known him a while , claire , and he
[60/1000]	when the doors opened , he was shoved inside , pushed over and kicked around . he was left alone in the main room of the palace . the palace guards did n't bother with him but left him alone
[61/1000]	" thanks for helping me , " he said . she nodded and opened the door to her garage . " what did the two of you talk about ? " " i wanted to say sorry ,
[62/1000]	the crowd begins to grow with my excitement . i almost wonder if their attention - span would extend if they were all here at once . the music shifts into a deep bass , and we turn to
[63/1000]	" you may not . i do n't know . he 's probably had only six hours since our departure and we do n't even know what time we left . " " well , now we know ,
[64/1000]	" what 's happening ? " kate demanded . a door opened at the end of the hall , and rachel ran in , her heart pounding . " rachel , please . is paul still alive ? "
[65/1000]	" you get it , " he said . " what do you think is playing ? " he moved his leg , but nothing came . the other leg was silent , except a brief rattle of
[66/1000]	" at least i get a little peace instead of boring ! " she wailed , before disappearing . " and now i 'm waiting for a few women to come up behind me and kiss my ass like
[67/1000]	that 's a good one . " " right . i do . but i just , well , i 've sort of been having these strange feelings lately , " she said . " well that 's
[68/1000]	" when i thought about it for a moment , i realized that it does make sense . " he paused for a minute , gazing down at me , and i tensed up . " but i 've figured
[69/1000]	i have a tendency toward hyper sp atial travel . i thought so once , at a private party . an event that was of such size and importance that my friends went up in flames . " what
[70/1000]	" what 's that ? " " that 's a reminder that you have to watch it more closely . i get the feelings that you 're a little tired of your job and sometimes frustrated with not a
[71/1000]	" why did you do it ? " asked justin . mae was n't listening , too full of her own anger at his mockery of an image of her and mae together . she did n't know why
[72/1000]	" that 's right " , i replied as i stared at the phone . " the most popular member of our family and friends are now on you ? " this was strange . she was n't just
[73/1000]	i knew what to do next ; i just did n't know how i wanted to do it . i also could n't say no to it , could i ? i think i would have . so i said
[74/1000]	i sigh with happiness and feeling really good about all this - like maybe i was just letting the mood get to me . i close my eyes tight . i feel like i was just a teen
[75/1000]	" can i get you anything , ma'am ? " kate felt her face flush with embarrassment . " i 'm not sure . just some water with ice on it , please . " he left and
[76/1000]	" i 'm not , " he says and looks at me . " i 'm not looking for a girlfriend , " he says , then his eyes widen and he takes a step back . " i 'm
[77/1000]	" oh thank god , " i whisper , too grateful to give into my panic . " he found us , " nate informs the team , and my heart stumbles at hearing nate 's calm voice .
[78/1000]	my mother did n't say anything , but her voice held guilt . she took a few steps toward my father , and he came into her arms like a little boy eager for his mother 's affection . the
[79/1000]	as i look down at adam 's swollen knuckles in my hands , i can hear my real thoughts : he 's not a man either . not the cold heartless kind , that 's for sure . nothing we
[80/1000]	as soon as we were inside and closing the door , i pointed at the couch . " sit down , " he said . i did as he said , careful not to hurt him and taking
[81/1000]	" damn , you 're a good athlete , " i complimented her . " thanks , " she said , smiling as she sipped her coffee . " so what 's up with you tonight ? "
[82/1000]	" of course , as long as you and i have decided to do something together soon , i promise , i 'll let you know . " she lifted her eyebrow , searching his face . " what
[83/1000]	" i hate you , " she said with sudden violence . " i hate how much you 've changed me , how you have my father , and you know how much i hate you . " i
[84/1000]	" just say goodbye , " my ex - boyfriend begged , the tears streaming down her face . i jumped off the couch and made my way to the bedroom , kicking the door shut behind me .
[85/1000]	" you 're only a junior , " he tells me . " you wo n't get a college education until you get married . you wo n't graduate until you 're fourteen . we all make mistakes . "
[86/1000]	" ' tis , but ye find the other three ... " he lifted a brow , and smiled at claire . " ' tis no wrong to want to . but i do n't want ye to leave them
[87/1000]	i gave him a wry smile when he stared at me askance . i was starting to think he 'd recognize where i was from . i was a little out of my element over here , but there were
[88/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " i said when he shifted uncomfortably in his seat . " i made it too much to ask you to do it , did n't i ? " " that was n't your
[89/1000]	the man behind the counter looked confused . " but what 's happened ? " " i did n't get the chance to find out . i have n't seen her again and i do n't think she was
[90/1000]	" so what exactly is it you want to show me ? " i demanded , holding the front for the next few moves . " well , " said mr. marlin suddenly , a smile crossing his lips
[91/1000]	" thanks , " i said . " your friend , gary , is real nice . " " he is . " " have you met him ? " " no , i do n't plan
[92/1000]	" good . i can see how you 're looking at the tv . " with a smile , i step around him and run . " hello , honey . " meg and meg are on
[93/1000]	" who ? " he asked again . " um . my ex . " the bartender , the girl standing next to matt , smiled at me . i felt a blush rush to my face
[94/1000]	" that 's okay . my boyfriend is just here to stop by . do you want me to turn the lights in so that you can watch tv ? " " mom , i think i know what
[95/1000]	' all right , ' she said . ' let 's talk you through it in a minute . do n't worry ; you 'll get it . ' and she gave him a little shake , not expecting
[96/1000]	" and an old woman is going to pay ? " " we ca n't let her kill everyone who visits and still be alive when it comes to the rest of us . " " what if
[97/1000]	" why do you insist on this ? " his arms tightened around her . the action made her feel safe , safe and cared for by him . " this is why . " grace took a pull
[98/1000]	" did you want to know about the day of the incident ? " " i did . what happened ? " he pulled me close , and pushed a stray lock of hair from my eyes .
[99/1000]	" you 'll see . you 'll have lots of fun , " david said . " does a new job mean more excitement for you ? " david thought for a moment . " yeah , it
[100/1000]	" you were watching the news this morning and you said we should look at this last part of the story on television today ! " she had never heard that before . she had been very secretive about what
[101/1000]	<EOS> i let my gaze fall to the blanket . the blue canvas was getting a little scratchy from the rain . if nothing else , it was better than my last , so i figured this was a good
[102/1000]	" when i hear that her highness is alive and kicking , i might go back and have a word with her ... right then ... or i could kill her myself . " " what are you going
[103/1000]	no . no . my heart leapt into my throat as the realization that i was going to fight my own life - in order to survive . i was going to have to take on everyone i could
[104/1000]	' well , ' she began hesitantly , ' there 's no point in going into details . there 's no point in lying to you , is there ? there are just enough facts that are absolutely essential to
[105/1000]	when i say wolf , i mean i ca n't say wolf is still dead in there . he 's a dead wolf . you can almost see his heart beating . i see a face as i pass
[106/1000]	" if i tell you to do something , " she started . " you have to tell me to do a thing . " " do i ? " " yes . if i tell you to
[107/1000]	but there is no one i met at the bookstore , only a couple of men in tuxe dos who have both got their attention on a photo of an older woman smiling at them , an older man with
[108/1000]	" we 're taking her to the castle so she can be made acquainted with all the princesses , " added a maid at my elbow . " so am i. " i pushed away , unable to bring
[109/1000]	" you should have been in court until you have made <EOS> ... you 're sure to get over it , right ? " " it 's still good . you can show it to them , " i
[110/1000]	and there it was , standing at the edge of the forest where she had left her pack . she was stunned to find that she was not afraid . she was simply frozen with terror . how had he
[111/1000]	" you have got to be joking . you work during the summer , remember ? " " i 'll be back the next spring . " " you wo n't leave because of me ? oh ,
[112/1000]	the rain had stopped , but the air carried a chill . two gray clouds churned overhead . " maybe we should take a walk , " he suggested . " what are you talking about ? "
[113/1000]	a voice bellowed in the darkness , " you better get off your hands now , you little traitor ! " " shit ! " someone yelled from an alley , and in an instant , a man with
[114/1000]	' you 're going to a stupid party with his daughter ! you 're going to be dating him a long time . ' ' i do n't need to date any of you to have a party ,
[115/1000]	he frowned , thinking back to all the times he 'd pushed her in this direction . " was n't they too young ? they did n't do very well . could it be our boy is a boy ?
[116/1000]	' when was this ? ' ' last night . we arrived at it around six - thirty . ' she pointed to the area on the next page where she had scrawled the date . ' but even
[117/1000]	" i have to get to her . " " then you have to get to her . do what you have to do . " he turned and stalked out the door . i did the same .
[118/1000]	" no , so you 've kept it all this time , i can see that , but - " " stop talking about it . " she put an end to his protest and put a finger on
[119/1000]	the old lady raised her hand in the air . " please do n't answer that question . " the waitress dropped off the pie and the coke . " i 'm sorry , " she apologized to rose
[120/1000]	but if they only knew where she was , would they still allow her to stay ? " i ... i really , really like them , " she finally said , trying to keep her voice low and
[121/1000]	the last one might have been a young buck lying on the ground . a gunshot from shotgun shell ca sings lay on the ground , too low for them to make out the victim 's face clearly . four
[122/1000]	" my people have fought valiantly with the trolls , " said the troll , " and so have those of the t sor tean kingdom . we have gone down to join them , but our king , that
[123/1000]	" oh , my god , you ca n't do that ! " she sobbed . " i 'm one step away from being a big f * * kin ' star ! " he kissed her again ,
[124/1000]	" sure , thanks for clearing that up . " " you 're kind . " she smiled . " so , i ca n't tell you how glad i am to hear that . i 've got
[125/1000]	she lifted her eyebrows at him , obviously guessing his mood . he hated to believe this was the case , but it was true . and she was in his bed . " what 's wrong ? "
[126/1000]	" i 'd love to think so . " " and you should too . " " i do n't know what i would have done if i had n't had the doctor 's notes to guide me
[127/1000]	" yes . " " why ? " " what is it to you ? " " it 's the baby . i want to make sure it 's okay . " her face blanched at
[128/1000]	" thank you , no ! " it is too late that he can argue . " no harm will come to you unless we can figure things out quickly . do you understand what i 'm saying ?
[129/1000]	" i can also ask you a question , " he told her with a gentle voice . " do you love the woman ? " chapter ten nikki 's jaw dropped as her father 's words were
[130/1000]	" that 's my girl , " he says , and pats my knee . " come and put your arms around me . i have something in my possession for you . " okay , then .
[131/1000]	" well , sir i - " " no ! " cried an eager voice behind her . it was the voice of her mother . " you will be staying with your brother , little magpie ! and
[132/1000]	" we were all the children in the city of dead , " i confirmed and the girls made a small sound of horror that sounded more like a sigh . " but we are no longer , " i
[133/1000]	it was like she 'd turned off her brain . what the hell was she going to do ? all at once , she was afraid of calling attention to herself . afraid of people looking at her
[134/1000]	i sat , the words spilling out of me until i felt awkward and foolish . he let me speak but he never answered . " did you know that stephan was going to die ? " he did
[135/1000]	" well , what do you think ? " " well ... " i thought for a bit , before shrugging . " it looked a lot like <EOS> all the other old roads , so i guess i
[136/1000]	" you 're really angry , are n't you ? " oh god . why had he done that ? " if this is my fault , it 's going to be a giant headache , are n't
[137/1000]	" why would you think that ? " his expression suddenly turns curious and his eyes are no less watchful . " let me guess - you think i 'm the one being a naughty boy and wanting to make
[138/1000]	" um , yeah . " his eyes went to the tv . he then looked away . then he called , " hey ? " " i 'm sorry about the whole , what was your
[139/1000]	" i 've had to kill someone before , " i said . " but not somebody like you . " he cocked an eyebrow . " really ? " " yes . we did go to a
[140/1000]	the sun beat down on him , the heat stifling his lungs , making it impossible to find his bearings . on his hands and knees , he turned , finding only emptiness . a dark pool of water gurgled
[141/1000]	he frowned at the screen when it said " urgent " , and at the rest of his words that looked only vaguely reassuring . " what makes you say that ? " " i have to leave .
[142/1000]	" we 'll find . " i leaned in closer , my lips not quite touching his . " but not here , " i whispered . " not tonight . " because i was n't going there . not
[143/1000]	" well not all the way . not only did they stay together in their love for each other , but they were constantly together during the early times . " he said with a small smile . " the
[144/1000]	chapter four friday morning i awoke dressed in a dark suit . i was excited about my afternoon with jack and i gave a nervous giggle . i was n't going to blow him off like last night .
[145/1000]	" where is he , father ? " she asked . " i do n't know ! he may have gone down for a walk with a girl , i 'll find out for sure . do you want
[146/1000]	" that reminds me , did anyone find out why our girl - the one who 's gone missing - was missing today ? " that happened more often now since his mom 's disappearance . the case got a
[147/1000]	" just give me your address and i 'll make the arrangements for you . i have a phone number . you can say the word first thing in the morning . " chapter eighteen the next morning
[148/1000]	" let me look at what you have in mind . " " we 'd better meet up , " she said . " after the show 's finished , we 'll start over from memory as fast as
[149/1000]	i nodded . " who else knows about this ? " " we have n't told anybody . " " i know . " my head spun . " me , too . except with my family .
[150/1000]	there was no answer . apparently , the world had decided to move before we could . i did n't understand the significance , but figured that was normal , when things happened and people got arrested or killed
[151/1000]	" they 're on their way . " " tell him i 'll be there soon , " he managed to say . " i 'll tell him . " " you may as well . " she
[152/1000]	i laugh . " no . but we can go in and out of there a lot . " she smiles . " yeah right . you do realize that 's not how things work like you think .
[153/1000]	and so they had . he had never told her that his cousin was involved in a strange - looking drug operation . he could only ask one more time , " but do n't you think this is a
[154/1000]	" he 's got the girl , " my mother said . " she 's a looker , " i said . my mom chuckled . " yeah . but did you ever stop to think what the
[155/1000]	" shit , my turn again , why are you out ? " " because i 've been sitting here listening to the sound of your voice every single day . " " are you making fun of
[156/1000]	when the day came for me to leave , i finally decided to make an escape . " okay , i 'll see you in just a few minutes . " the thought of waiting in the car for
[157/1000]	" i still do n't understand what is happening here , " said brian . " you do n't have to worry about that if you just forget to look into this at all . it 's for your
[158/1000]	" no . i 'm not going to do it . " he nods and wipes his chin with the back of his hand . " you know me , nova . i 'm always on your side .
[159/1000]	" but i was n't part of the equation , though , was i ? " the question came softly . he nodded . " if you were n't a part of the equation , you 'd have gone
[160/1000]	" i see . " " the room is already made up for us . that 's why i brought clothes for you and ... for us . " he frowned at her . " for me ?
[161/1000]	he took my hand . " i 'm so sorry about tonight . " " thanks . " the word felt a little brittle , and i pulled back , holding me breath . " i 'd appreciate it
[162/1000]	" we thought you said this would n't take long , " she said , glancing at her watch . " not really . i 've only got an hour . when i get back , i need to
[163/1000]	" we 've just caught him . " there was no sign of the woman who 'd stayed , watching them like a hawk , her eyes wide with terror . " he shot a man last night in his
[164/1000]	" what am i going to do with you ? " his eyes flashed . " did i insult your masculinity ? " he chuckled and dragged me toward their bedroom . he pushed me up against
[165/1000]	' <EOS> ' ' you had to beat the crap out of him . ' ' are you sure that 's what you want to know how ? ' shouted a male voice from by me .
[166/1000]	" so did i , " i lied . " maybe you do n't hear it from everyone else at school . " " believe me , i 've tried . i think there were whispers of rumors coming
[167/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " what you 're saying ... it 's like a part of you is telling you to keep it secret . " " you 're not listening . i ... i
[168/1000]	" if you say so . let 's go , " he said , moving off the chair and closing the laptop . i watched him walk over a few feet and then change his mind . he was trying
[169/1000]	" what ? " i asked . " i 'm not f * * king sure they call them that anymore . " " who ? " " what ? does they really use the term '
[170/1000]	" i was just having a pleasant chat with james , " i reminded her . " and you 're being rude to my sister after the way she asked about you , " she continued . her voice
[171/1000]	" and a small town is the perfect place to meet ? " " why ? " " i wanted to take you to dinner . " his eyes flared . " you have a ... ?
[172/1000]	" we 've had a case , " the agent said , clearly uncomfortable with that information . " we 're going to try and prove it 's not in your hands . " " that 's what i
[173/1000]	" you were never so rude to me before ! " he stopped her . " did i complain ? " " no . " she tried to walk around him . " we have a great
[174/1000]	" you 've seen her , " he said , barely above a whisper . " i 've seen her , " i said , too low for her to hear . " get out of the way .
[175/1000]	" a pretty hot vampire can do that in front of a vampire . " " yeah , he does , " i admitted . " and really attractive . seriously . " " oh yeah ,
[176/1000]	" i 'm not surprised her boyfriend died . you know , i 'd be surprised if the two of you did n't have your whole lives ahead of you . i know that your brother did n't keep you
[177/1000]	" sure , i 'll throw it into the fire , " i said . " why ? " amelia asked . she sounded defensive , as if it probably was n't a good idea for us to spend
[178/1000]	" i really think she 'd be a very good girlfriend , " i heard him spit out . " what did you just say ? " the doctor asked . " okay , okay , it 's
[179/1000]	" not a chance , " he said coolly . " why ? " " oh , please . you know me . i take time , give it when it 's needed , do what i just
[180/1000]	" of course , " i said . no one responded . after a long pause , one woman said , " i want to see the guy behind it . " some reaction . i said
[181/1000]	she glanced at the clock on the wall , which read 5 :0 2 a.m. " i know you are n't exactly in good shape , " she said , " how about i make you a cup of tea
[182/1000]	" oh yeah ! i thought you would be too ! how 's that for fun ? " i joked . " it 's more like ... you're taking on all the responsibility , and i 'm out of
[183/1000]	" my daughter 's beautiful though , " she commented , not looking so happy . " better than anyone 's with his other pieces . " i moved my gaze back to my family and was proud to
[184/1000]	" i love you , too , baby , " i whispered , and kissed her forehead in return . without me seeing it , even if she had n't realized it , she was hugging me tighter .
[185/1000]	" i need to go to the police . " i said . " we need to see your mother first . she needs to know what happened to you , and for that you need to come with
[186/1000]	but there was no answer , no message of understanding . could she lie about that ? perhaps she had said too much already , the last thing she needed was to set herself off again . she certainly would
[187/1000]	" i did n't exactly expect you to like me . " " are you really that shallow ? " she shrugged . " it 's hard to be shallow when you 're trying to keep someone with
[188/1000]	i stood to follow the officer , but he grabbed my arm . " i do n't think so , sir . " he pulled me back to face him . " i saw you . <EOS> back to your
[189/1000]	we walk in silence for what seems like forever . " he said that he ca n't marry me . i said no . i should have . i ca n't . but i still do n't hate him
[190/1000]	but only after i got in the shower and pulled on a clean pair of jeans and a black long sleeved t - shirt . i hoped the guys were okay . they had n't called . they had
[191/1000]	although the wind had shifted and he knew the cold could n't change back , he was here only a short while and he could n't force this to go to sleep . maybe he should have been sleeping
[192/1000]	" i 'd like my life to be normal , if that 's what you 're asking , " i mumbled . " but i do n't . " the quiet in the room was heavy , and i
[193/1000]	" i 'm not exactly sure what 's wrong with him , " i said in reply . " well , it is what 's wrong with him . it 's as if he is n't his father .
[194/1000]	" um , it might seem to me like i 'm an old college student . " " old college student ? you 're in new york . " " i know , but i 'm here for
[195/1000]	" yes . " " he put out the warning before he died . he 's got to feel that there wo n't be others . " " well , it seems to me that the world is
[196/1000]	" go rest . the rest of us will meet you in town , " alex said . " well , i feel sorry for the children , for this is not the way of our little people ,
[197/1000]	i looked back at my dad , still seated in one of the chairs and thought , " maybe i should really go see what this is about . " in the room , i noticed that the nurse
[198/1000]	what the hell am i doing ? this is n't really happening ; i am a good girl . you are a good girl and the baby in your belly is your family . " she turned and reached for
[199/1000]	" i do n't know , " i said back , a smile tugging at the corner of my mouth . " why do you think the spell just slipped out of the loop ? " i 'd dropped
[200/1000]	" no she has n't , she is , " i told them grimly . " let 's go . " the others grabbed lilly 's shoulders with surprising strength . " let me out of here ! "
[201/1000]	my eyes stung only with the sight of him . " he 's all i 've ever wanted , " he whispered . i lifted my legs to wrap them around his waist . " mine .
[202/1000]	he took a deep breath . " well , he changed jobs . he 's a private investigator . we 're taking a few days off now . it is n't fair to make him wait . " i
[203/1000]	" no , you 're not , " he muttered , looking down at her . she smiled up at him , not even bothering to hide the fact that her legs were starting to feel numb from cold .
[204/1000]	" see you soon . " but she was gone , and without giving anything to lucas , i set my hand on my mother 's shoulder and started walking toward the apartment , which was now becoming quiet
[205/1000]	now , she gave him a look . " what if i had an accident ? " his brows furrowed . " do n't worry , buddy . it wo n't happen . i 'm confident this will heal
[206/1000]	i looked at his long legs and strong muscles that formed the long expanse of his torso , and i smiled through my pain . he held out a hand for me to sit down on the couch , and
[207/1000]	" i ca n't imagine why . " " well it goes away when i change the diapers . " he looked up at me , his eyes a bright silver in the faint morning light . "
[208/1000]	" you should eat , " she said . " you 're exhausted . " " i am sleeping . " she laughed , but there was little humor , just old age . you could n't really
[209/1000]	the man is wearing a black button down shirt , tan slacks and black shoes . he smiles a crooked smile and just before he does , i see a knife in his hand as he pulls the knife from
[210/1000]	" she 'll be all right , " he said . she was n't sure , but she thought he sounded sure . " you keep telling me that , pal . at one point , when she was
[211/1000]	" the people who lived through it are still alive , " she whispered . " we are the warriors of the circle , the warriors born and bred . that is our strength . " " your strength
[212/1000]	" it wo n't be a problem , " mrs. ma honey says . " you can have the room , and i 'll run up and buy a new rug . " " yes , ma'am , "
[213/1000]	" i will know . " he pressed his lips against hers and she opened up for him immediately . he knew he had to get them out of here . her memories of what had happened in the
[214/1000]	" i thought you were going to check in with me ? " i tease . " no ! i was going to put a stop to this . she was a distraction , " he says with a
[215/1000]	" very good , " i replied . after all , i was the one whose hands had felt the weight of the book . " we wo n't last that long , and we have to be ready
[216/1000]	' you certainly did , ' said the archchancellor , smiling gently . he sat heavily in a chair by the fire , and rubbed his hands together . ' i have seen some of your great spells , boy
[217/1000]	" that is a hell of a statement . i was just about to tell you how absolutely infuriating and idiotic your behavior could be over the phone . " my fingers stilled near the phone , which i
[218/1000]	the girl pointed to the third woman . " what ? he wo n't just kiss our tongues if he 's there . " " they 're in the club , " i shouted , taking in their closeness
[219/1000]	" why ? for what reason ? " " to ask me why her husband married her for her money . " what a stupid question . " i can not answer it , " he said ,
[220/1000]	" it should n't - " " it will . i want you to ride back with him . hold him while he recovers . do it without doing it all up in your lap , no matter how
[221/1000]	he nodded . his eyes were wide with fright at the sight of the black coffin under the arms of the girl , and he stared at the little girl . susan did n't know where he had seen her
[222/1000]	and that 's just when he did ask : " so what do you like to drink ? " oh , the way he looks at me ! " i do n't know " " well
[223/1000]	' now you should run all the way to canada ! you must do better than that ! do n't i pay top dollar for the best , just pick a date and we can have him ! '
[224/1000]	" i did n't find out what he was planning - " " he left . i also heard about his marriage to miss leeds after their divorce was finalized . and anyway ... when i was home ,
[225/1000]	" i 'm worried about you , " i say . " i 've never seen you like this , so ... " he crosses his arms . " like what ? " " i do n't have
[226/1000]	" you got that right . " he made no move to leave or even move closer . " so ... what ? you told me to get lost . " " i 'm not the one who gave
[227/1000]	her head wobbled . she tried to speak but it came out as a strangled grunt . then , it all came together : fear that she would lose her nerve , then panic that she had said yes ,
[228/1000]	" yeah . i hate that . " the conversation hung awkwardly in the air forever as they both sat at the table in silence . luke 's brother , steve , sat an easier distance away . he
[229/1000]	" for one thing , i 'm out . i 'm too busy to be working , so it 's not like i can go shooting or have a lot of plans , " i said as we made our
[230/1000]	" you 're sure ? " i asked , nodding . it was n't fair that this was a dream about her getting ready somewhere and not really doing anything . " i am positive . " "
[231/1000]	you mean that 's what you did ? she asked him , her eyes sparkling with glee . he nodded with pride . yep , i did . it was amazing . she was happy for them both
[232/1000]	a second later , seth opened a door to a small . " you have that right here ! " a strange - sounding man said in a boisterous voice . " are you listening to me ? i
[233/1000]	a little smile touched her lips - not a sweet smile of thanks - but a kind of sad smile of determination . " never . " chapter seven the morning of ryan 's fifth anniversary , all
[234/1000]	he sighed , his eyes still fixed on them . " a month after that , my wife died . " i closed my eyes . " she was killed in the field , " he said .
[235/1000]	" you 're wrong , " dylan said . " i need to know . " rachel dropped her hands . " what is the point of all this ? what do you want from me ? "
[236/1000]	" i thought i was supposed to , but i almost got into a fight with a cop yesterday . " " you nearly drowned ? " " i do n't know why you have this fascination with
[237/1000]	" that 's something the police will have to manage on their own . thank all the gods for the new police system , " dan chuckled , raising his hand to make the call to the city police commissioner
[238/1000]	" what does ' i see ' mean to you ? " " you see the way i change my shape . so that was the idea to take you to my room . " she did a perfect
[239/1000]	my hand came to rest on the door as i stood . " what kind of world is this ? " " i do n't know . " the back of her eyes misted over . " did
[240/1000]	her cell phone rang , but she ignored it . her dad was probably yelling at her . she did n't want him to be angry with her . sighing so loudly she was n't sure she 'd be
[241/1000]	" i did n't mean for it to be a secret . " " no need to tell me . whatever it is , it 's one of the reasons for my being here now . because i got
[242/1000]	" yeah , " he agreed . i moved my lips against his . he kissed me back , his hands sliding into my hair and holding me like i was his lifeline . then he muttered ,
[243/1000]	i looked at the back of the truck . my mouth dropped open as i realized what i was seeing . " oh my god , he 's out there , " i whispered as i went to the
[244/1000]	" it was in that box at the bottom of the grave . " the memory was faint and barely clear . and , in that moment , she wanted a man like jake . someone who knew what could
[245/1000]	" your daughter is an amazing person , rachel , " emma said . " you must watch out for her too . " " is that what i should say ? " i asked , surprised . "
[246/1000]	" no , it 's not funny . there 's this woman who comes back from the dead - one from the same place . she has these eyes , like maybe a cat 's , on her face ,
[247/1000]	" i do n't hate you , " said the elf . matilda and zin zab ad peered into the shadows . there was an invisible wind , but after a few minutes they heard the faint creak of
[248/1000]	" you 'll live long enough for me to see you do it . keep an eye on her , protect her at all costs , " i order him . i close the door and turn to the
[249/1000]	" what 's going on ? " " her folks ' first marriage ended badly . that makes this all the more tragic . but since it 's just the two of them , it helps when we first
[250/1000]	" one for each , " he said quickly . " let 's start a large , dry table and put it up on the platform . " she did n't miss the way he went to move his
[251/1000]	" why , thank you , ma'am , " he said , and the words seemed to have no place on his tongue . " and where would you like to go ? " a sigh . no
[252/1000]	" i am just glad that this was not the last time , i believe . " the three of us did n't really know what to say other than to smile . it was a small relief to
[253/1000]	" i 'm not certain you can . i 'll only tell you what i know . " " we 've only just found each other , " he says . " i know all you 've learned ,
[254/1000]	" yes ? " " you gave up your career for me . this is an incredibly generous thing you 've done , and i 'm truly - seriously - grateful . " " but still , i
[255/1000]	" stop playing around and explain , " he ordered . " right behind you . " i was the one who moved , but his eyes stayed fixed on mine . my skin had started to burn
[256/1000]	" what 're you talking about ? " he said quickly , eyes trying to pick up the pieces . " i got myself all worked up about finding a dead bird . you want to come over to my
[257/1000]	" i 'm not , " i lied , since i already knew that was the case . " i 'm going home . " we walked down the dirt path . " bye , joey , "
[258/1000]	the last part of that last part was true nonetheless , and it was how she spoke to that stranger right away - through her eyes - in the hour - old dream . " who are you ,
[259/1000]	" for the man . now look here - it 's not his fault . i did take all this ... this ... " he waved his hand as though he were drawing a sketch of an imaginary face ,
[260/1000]	my heart raced . " so what have i done that you refuse to apologize ? " we stopped walking and he bent down for a kiss . " i would be the one apologizing if you had
[261/1000]	i stand in the middle of my living room and wonder what the hell she 's waiting for me for . at one thirty in the morning , i wake to a loud pounding on the door . "
[262/1000]	" do you want to look across the aisle from me right now ? " he asked , his voice so quiet , so tender ... and i froze . " no , " i whispered . "
[263/1000]	no way ! " there you are . " a familiar tone laced with amusement . " the ladies go right through here . " noelle glanced over , disappointment widening her blue eyes . dallas stood at
[264/1000]	" hey , i know you , man . you 're a cop . you 'll give me a chance to back out ? " " why ? you do n't like me ? " " do n't
[265/1000]	" do you have a house on the mountain or not ? " " actually , no , " he replied quietly . " i live in a house half a mile from here . " he was aware
[266/1000]	" no , i mean i agree , it does n't make sense . " " i need to know what happened exactly . we need to know how much money he 's letting her have under his control
[267/1000]	" okay , " i decided . " so , first time i have seen it ? " my eyes closed momentarily . " sure . " " i saw my mother in a grocery store ,
[268/1000]	please do not sell her now . please . she 's been running . being a killer was making her reckless , and the problem is n't where she 's going . which means there 's nowhere to
[269/1000]	i take a deep breath , letting out my pent up breath . " well , you might as well buy me a drink . " his eyes flick up and meet mine . they take me in slowly
[270/1000]	i 'm no saint . i did a lot during my childhood . it was n't the most ideal life for me . but it seemed like i had no choice , so yes , i could accept the reality
[271/1000]	" he 's a charmer , " john laughed . " he ca n't help it , he 's good at this . with <EOS> " good " , i would say that is mostly a term of endearment
[272/1000]	" they 've been after his boat . " " the money . " " apparently . we ca n't let them stop us from seeing them . " " did his driver check there ? "
[273/1000]	i say , " if this all starts to go horribly wrong , you 're never going to have to worry about me . " " that 's probably true . what do you say to telling me why just
[274/1000]	" in the sky ? " will looked at claire . he had never been around a religious city , and had been taught that a mother would have no idea what to do with a boy who was talking
[275/1000]	" hello , it 's me , " i said evenly , hoping my voice would n't betray me . " it 's dark , and i 'm alone . " my stomach lurched . something was wrong .
[276/1000]	" this is fine , " said seldon . the two men walked through the door and seldon closed it . the corridor was half - lighted and lighted only by an indirect sunlight that hit the ground floor
[277/1000]	" you got a life - sentence , " miller said . " the guy in the ring has to be a martian . " " this one 's not so bad , " holden said . " he
[278/1000]	" but you have had a long reign as prince of england ; why would you not wish to get back at her father for the crime of abandoning you , " he said with genuine concern for me ,
[279/1000]	" why are you here ? " " since i 've been with him , i thought maybe i could get his attention . since our relationship is n't about working together , you probably have a couple guys
[280/1000]	" i 'm doing all that i can to help him , " i whispered to the people around me . " thank you , " murmured a middle - aged , very fat woman , clutching a plastic
[281/1000]	my fingers wrapped around her hips . for them , i touched the inside of her thigh . instead of walking away , though , i curled my fingers , holding her to me . " did i make
[282/1000]	" hey . " " you need to figure out how to get those people safely to safety . not knowing that everyone you ever really tried to get to knows about their family will just be harder ...
[283/1000]	" yeah ? " " got to move fast or everyone we trust is going to die . this guy is going to look suspicious , " i said , my smile disappearing so fast i was sure i
[284/1000]	" i really want you , sam , " he said in a ragged voice , still speaking very softly . she leaned into him in delight . she loved the way he talked to her . the raspy
[285/1000]	all the tension came to an abrupt halt as his eyes narrowed on her face . " do you really think i 'd let you go un punished ? " she shrugged . " it does n't matter
[286/1000]	" would you be able to see what 's in the house ? i 'd like to bring in some boxes . " " you think you 'll find anything in there ? " amy asked . "
[287/1000]	emma 's heart fluttered . after a moment , she said , " well , you really are , as my dad said there . " ethan 's eyes were wide with astonishment . " you are ? "
[288/1000]	" yeah - no , it was n't fair to force you to talk to me back then . i tried to be nice to them and it just pushed them back into that i was n't in your love
[289/1000]	slowly , cole moved to stand in front of her . while kissing her , his hand circled her waist and he jerked her closer . she would have wriggled away from him if his hold on her still had
[290/1000]	" that 's not really a problem for us . " " why is n't this one ? " ryan said quickly . " for one thing , it requires a very sensitive area . i wanted to
[291/1000]	" and ... ? " " and we both should n't have tried so hard to resist it . i 'm sorry . " i nodded , wondering if i had done something wrong . " it 's
[292/1000]	once they found out i must have stolen something , they thought i was out to steal a doll . " " how did they know you had it ? " " i put it in my pocket
[293/1000]	" no , " i whispered , suddenly weary of the situation . " you were right , " ivy said . " you were right . it 's the only thing standing between us . the most important
[294/1000]	" you 're still bleeding . " he reached down and touched the blood streaming down my neck . " christ , layla , i never stopped . fuck , layla . what the hell did you do
[295/1000]	he said she was like a horse . like a flower blooming . a sweet , gentle flower , a lush and fragrant , yet not quite dangerous thing , a flower with poison , and only a single ,
[296/1000]	" i 'm here , now , " he repeated , this time with more urgency . she stopped shivering in the chill of the dark , the air damp and cool against her skin , cold enough to
[297/1000]	" he already has . i do n't want to see this . " " what do you plan to do ? " " maybe i 'm going to move on . " " are you going
[298/1000]	" sure , babe . " after that , i fell asleep in her arms with her head on my chest . we talked all night long about a lot of stuff , most of it having to do
[299/1000]	" so am i , " daniel replied . " just want the hell out of this place . " daniel reached for his pack under the seat of the minivan . he extracted a long length of black
[300/1000]	as i got down off the gurney , i could sense jacob 's stare on me , and knew he 'd see the tears on the outside , i could see that . the doctors were already here
[301/1000]	i can not fathom how i ever would have missed the sight of the light flashing on his face again . " if you are worried about my safety , i can think of a couple of ways to protect
[302/1000]	" you know what ? " he said . " i do n't care now . i 'll wait ' til i marry her . i love her . " he sat there until the wind and rain finally stopped
[303/1000]	" just the one , " she said . " give me about three hours , " she added , before the door clicked shut behind her . her cell phone began to ring before the bed ended its
[304/1000]	" then it 's up to you . " " i do n't know what to do next . " he shook his head . " do n't . do n't call this off . stay here and
[305/1000]	" yeah . i 'm a total sucker for you , mia . " he reaches over and grabs my hand . his thumb brushes across my palm and i feel butterflies in my stomach . " i should
[306/1000]	" get the bags in the car , " i told her . " i 'll get more later . " " there 's a woman who owns a car ? " " hey , we 're in
[307/1000]	" i 'll wait . tell me when . " he gave her a nod then closed his door . rose considered pulling her purse over her head and dressing like a girl , but decided that would be
[308/1000]	it gave me a moment to put my brain back into gear and follow her for a while before she was gone . in fact , i think one less thing i 'd be doing for the next few
[309/1000]	he 'd found her scent on the ground , clinging to his clothes , her scent ... clinging to him . damn , she still smelled good . " do you want to do this ? " lucas asked
[310/1000]	" they should have it for halloween . i do n't have time to go shopping . you did n't come up here for my birthday , did you ? because you 're not here anymore and i do n't
[311/1000]	he looked at one . " what 's - " " i 'm the best teacher , so i 'm good in class . but if you happen to study with me , and i mean study with you
[312/1000]	i try to stand , but i can not . " you ca n't do this . " no answer . he waits , and i feel his fingers on my upper arm like they 're trying to force
[313/1000]	" a simple fire . i 'm not leaving this house again . " " what if he hurts you ? " grace asked . " i had to get you away . i needed the air - conditioning
[314/1000]	" who gives a crap ? " she says . " why is it that your life is so fucking complicated ? " " i do n't know . because i trust you , " i say . well
[315/1000]	" no ... i do n't like being around you . you do n't know what you 're doing . " " but i do - " " no , do n't . but why would you ?
[316/1000]	but she did n't want to fight with him . she did n't want to care what he did . but she did care . " go on , love , " he urged gently .
[317/1000]	" let me stay on , dear , " said the teacher . " oh , dear , my poor - dear - dear , my - dear , " said her mother . " i do n't want
[318/1000]	" what time are you finishing your classes ? " " i 'm not going to ask if it 's too quick . " i glanced at my watch . " two o'clock . let 's do it .
[319/1000]	" you have my word , " i said , voice husky . " are you asking me to marry you ? " " not exactly , " i tried to soothe , still trying to process things
[320/1000]	" good , no harm done , " he said . " all of the others are dead by now ? " " everything 's fine . we 've got all the evidence we need . we 're all
[321/1000]	the answer was simply something that would never surface again , but i was n't sure how to stop it . we sat there chatting for a long time , and when i said i needed to get home
[322/1000]	he was n't sure . he 'd had no trouble with that either . she might not even know how much it mattered to her , but she needed to feel loved . more loved than she 'd ever been
[323/1000]	" sorry , babe . i ca n't , " he said , his voice husky and deep . " no problem . " she smiled up at him , but it was an embarrassed smile . " i
[324/1000]	she pulled out a thick yellow folder and held it up by its top label . then she held it out by the bottom loop on the top and stared at jack . " this is the missing evidence
[325/1000]	i looked up into his dark eyes and smiled . he looked down at his hands . " thank you , " he whispered . " so , you are n't married ? " i asked .
[326/1000]	" i do n't know how much it will cost you to kill him . he 's not about to bleed out in your kitchen . " " i would n't expect him to . " i said as
[327/1000]	" no , she was , " i say finally . i can not keep the disgust out of my voice and i know it is only because i am looking at her closely . " you know this story
[328/1000]	" so ... what goes on in this town besides me , huh ? " " you know what you 're askin ' - " " go on . " " he sees himself being with me
[329/1000]	she gasped and clenched her teeth even tighter . " you can make you come with my dick , " he drawled . " that 's all you have to do . " her hand shook even more violently
[330/1000]	" so , if people would really love to come to our party the two of us would invite them for a couple of drinks , just a handful of people and friends that you knew . for pete 's
[331/1000]	" please , " i whisper . he grins into my hair and runs a thumb over my cheek . i swallow a sob of un wi el dy emotion and put my face in it before he continues
[332/1000]	" she says no , the other girl she was with ... she said something like ' oh ! to see me ! ' " " ah . that 's right . " " it was one of
[333/1000]	" but ... " " his mouth is free to speak ! " " but he ca n't ! now put him on , now ! " the young man held out his bare hand awkwardly for
[334/1000]	the words sounded so strange and strange in my ears , but i suddenly found myself remembering the words from my father 's journal ; the words he 'd written in his journal . these words i could understand ,
[335/1000]	" and what of the prophecy ? " clary asked . " what about the prophecies ? what does that mean ? they 're all in . what happens after the new world ? " " where it all
[336/1000]	" you see it as another obstacle . " the old man 's voice grew louder as he stood before them . his face was pinched and wrinkled from long years of experience and effort . then he spoke
[337/1000]	" i do n't know why you 're so afraid of what i am , " he admits quietly . " it 's just a little ... different . " " i 'm not afraid of you . "
[338/1000]	my stomach drops . " you 're - that 's alex . " i ca n't even think of where i got the name from , though . the old man shakes his head . " that young man
[339/1000]	the rain dropped again as she pulled the blankets off one of the bunks . something big hit the bed next to her and woke her up . she shoved her hat on and looked up , waiting for the
[340/1000]	" your father is a hard ass , but he 's the best . if you wanted to leave , he would have told you exactly where to go . he may have hated it , but he did love
[341/1000]	i do n't expect to meet anyone else at the house that evening . i 'm pretty sure what i 'm looking for is a place because there 's no car in the lot and nobody comes and goes from
[342/1000]	he sighed . " i know . i 'll get an explanation sometime . from my buddies . " " good . now , do what you 're told and ... and you , " she said , pointing
[343/1000]	she 'd make this bastard pay , for sure . but first she 'd make sure she 'd have the satisfaction of seeing his mouth fall open , that his eyes widen , his face close enough to touch
[344/1000]	" you really do n't want to do this , " i said , fighting the hysteria that was threatening to overtake me . james turned to me once we were back in the ballroom . " i know
[345/1000]	" you wo n't . " i sighed . " i can ... there 's an edge there . it 's part of what i love about you , but i 'm not willing to risk it , james
[346/1000]	" maybe you could go for a morning run and then you could come back home , " james suggests . " i have to go home . i ca n't wait to meet my father ! "
[347/1000]	" how come i do n't get one ? or maybe ... " " because it feels boring , not to mention boring . you and i are the only three people at harrison who 've ever walked on
[348/1000]	" it 's getting late , " she added , finally breaking the silence . " let 's get some sleep . we 'd better have another meal and sleep . " he hesitated . " what ?
[349/1000]	" me ? " " yes . you love me , and i love you . it 's me you have to worry about . i 'm not here to see you . this is all a great misunderstanding
[350/1000]	" we need more security , we ca n't do this alone . the children could be hurt . " she nodded slowly and released me as i thought that i 'd just killed the only person i could
[351/1000]	" do me what ? " he asked , bewildered because she kept looking at him as though he were delusional . " go back to bed . i want to be alone . " his entire body
[352/1000]	" let me go ! " she struggled in my grasp . he jerked her in the opposite direction and then went right at the man who held her , knocking him to the ground . the whole time i

[354/1000]	i turned back to the others . " i got through it . so it 's not a problem . " we would all have to move quickly ... quickly enough to get this going . i headed

[359/1000]	she was n't done yet . he shifted to look more at her . she tried not to let her eyes drift shut . he was n't going to hold out much longer . " do you
[360/1000]	" no , " she said honestly . he sounded sincere enough , although i was n't sure what the sincerity could be . " i saw several more cars going in from all sides . they did n't look
[361/1000]	" i do n't see any sign of guards , " he murmured . " what exactly do you think is there ? " " someone who took the time to collect the sword from the altar .
[362/1000]	" do you know who he was ? " asked a third man , which would have been matthew but for the missing left ear . " why does it matter ? " " because we 're all
[363/1000]	" hey ! " he says , grinning like an idiot . " you are stunning ! " " thanks . " i smile around my mouthful of food and feel a little silly with myself . i 'm

[365/1000]	he took me back to the cabin and we both went out so i could tuck him in . there was n't much of a cover , so he still had a few extra shirts and pants . we got
[366/1000]	" to have them so close , but not to keep them . it 's one of those things . that 's why some are so important to you . to see you . " " maybe to protect

[370/1000]	" it 's in the fridge , " he said , sounding exasperated , and i watched , horrified , as he pulled a package of crackers out from the cupboard . " i 'll order more in . "
[371/1000]	" what am i supposed to say to him ? i 'm sorry i took your stuff . i 'm sorry , i should n't have forced you to do that . " you were going to leave it ?
[372/1000]	" i was expecting your visit again , but when i called the place , he was n't there . i thought maybe he was in the market this afternoon , " elise said . francesca noticed elise 's
[373/1000]	" i was fine , " she snapped . " hey , i thought we were going to this . why the f * * k did n't you tell me you liked dinner with a group of other

[375/1000]	he slid right into the middle of the conversation , clearing his throat and then shaking it . the queen reached over and ran her hand lightly down his arm . it was so warm and solid ,
[376/1000]	" why would n't you ? " she asks . now i step back from her , afraid of what i may have revealed . " i guess as time goes by , i 'll have to find out
[377/1000]	' i ca n't help you ! ' she slammed down . ' we did not have the benefit of your knowledge in the past . now we do n't have the benefit of your friendship and the pleasure of

[381/1000]	" it was so nice seeing you again . i hope they let you take a day off , " she said . anne smiled as she watched her son walk over to his dad . as he wrapped his

[384/1000]	the air stirred again and in an instant , the lights came back on simultaneously . he knew instantly that it had been a nightmare . they did not stop the fire . they kept on dancing , but
[385/1000]	" how was work ? " he would be so glad to hear from her by the end of work . " it was great . it was a great idea . " she was talking about going
[386/1000]	" no reason , " the reporter assured her . " thank you . " " i also see you 've spoken with your boss , " one of the reporters piped up . " i 've heard he
[387/1000]	the demon moved again , though more slowly , and a second wave of air rushed out from where he 'd been , but this time it did n't sting . the second wave was much heavier , stronger ,

[389/1000]	" i believe he 's here . might take you a while to get ready . " ty looked at him , biting the inside of his cheek . he nodded slowly , and when the waitress had left
[390/1000]	" my god , dad . i need my husband right now . " " of course , honey . i 'll go get him , " he said after a moment , and hung up . "

[392/1000]	there was such a small window that she could n't be sure if they were staring at her . sometimes i 'd hear the air hiss between the boards as the person next to me shrugged his shoulders , and
[393/1000]	" do you want to know how many ? " silence . " they say so right here and right now , " he whispered , making her breath catch , making her need him further , more
[394/1000]	" what ? " he asked , a hint of unease in his voice . " you heard me . " the day before she 'd stopped answering his phone . if the woman who was supposed to give
[395/1000]	" let me go . i can - did you - " but his arms were encircling her as he brought his mouth down on hers and kept her talking , telling her to say it again and again
[396/1000]	" i know , darling . it 's just a big job . you know what i 'm talking about . " " i do . but i worry about the patients in here . have you heard about
[397/1000]	" there 's that thing . " he did n't raise his voice to show he knew how to make an argument . " i think i should leave the house . " " and you 'll just be
[398/1000]	" my mum is going to kill you . you have been to ground . a hundred and three times . where were you today ? you were n't there ? " " i was on an excursion with
[399/1000]	the first thing to happen when she saw what the rest of the group had was a swarm of black ants crawling all around their legs . they were like dark phantoms , like crawling insects . " watch
[400/1000]	" why did you let me sleep ? what did you guys do ? " " there are some rooms where we can rest tonight , and then at the drop of a hat we will have our next
[401/1000]	" you think ? " he said , his voice a low laugh . " you could see me if you wanted to , a hundred questions . " his voice was no longer his voice . his voice had
[402/1000]	" but are there really any kinds of things ? " " there have to be . i just do n't know how . " " what about ghosts ? " she asked . " i saw one
[403/1000]	" what a stupid old man you are ! be certain you will never go to the party . " " yes . " " oh , good ! " " why , i 'll be at
[404/1000]	" the fire ! " he said without thinking , and jumped the nearest tree . before either of us could even move , the woman bolted forward , a black blur as she slashed forward . i did
[405/1000]	she gave her head a hard shake . she almost wanted to push him , but she knew he would n't be willing to give her away . until she was sure about him , he was n't interested in
[406/1000]	i grinned . " for the record , your eyes are pretty f * * king wild . " he pulled me closer . " but i 'm a big boy and it 's your job to show me how
[407/1000]	i nodded , which made the tension return . with a lot of effort i opened my mouth as she pushed the little paper to the floor and leaned over it . " we 're going to call him
[408/1000]	" yeah , but he was n't like this with me . why do n't we say , ' i 'm sorry i left before you and seth had a chance to , ' and that works for me ?
[409/1000]	" no ... no good ... in me ... " " but of course ... to you do n't i have a message from the gods . " " no ... no good ... " " there

[413/1000]	she continued to sit at his feet , her nails digging into the soles of his feet . he could hear the growl of her self - control , the soft me wls that seeped out of her . he
[414/1000]	' never ! ' she picked up her mobile and dialled the number on the small screen . ' hi , this is the one , ' tara picked up the cordless handset in the kitchen , '
[415/1000]	now that the day had come , what came next ? " how did you know ? " " it makes no difference . you remember how i was making fun of you earlier . " he was
[416/1000]	" what 's going to happen to us ? " jenna asked . she looked terrified . " yes , we 're going to die . " i had no idea how long we had before our lives
[417/1000]	" they do , though they leave you alone , for now . you 're safe in here . " " my cousin 's sleeping , " she replied defensively . " and you 're sleeping in here in
[418/1000]	" this little guy will be fine , " grandpa said as he walked over to the window and dropped my little golden mutt in the pond before walking toward me . i reached down and scooped him up in
[419/1000]	" please tell me you 'll come back . " " of course . now , about your birthday . " " no , i do n't think you should do that . " " i have
[420/1000]	" well , you did . it 's really better than nothing . " " thanks , " he said , before i shut the front door on his astonished expression . * * * sunday evening
[421/1000]	" well , he would , " said amy . " let 's leave the kids for now . " " that sounds interesting . " " very interesting . follow my lead . " they circled
[422/1000]	then he picked up a shovel and a piece of lumber , and set off for the nearest opening in the rock , searching for his key again . it all seemed to be slipping away as he went ,
[423/1000]	" who was that ? " " the president , " someone else answered . this was the last time they were to be reunited . " are your folks alright ? " he considered the question
[424/1000]	to change the subject , i suggest to her , " maybe the first time you play here , they do n't send those guys to try to get you an invitation to your party . " she nods
[425/1000]	there followed a lengthy discussion and then a lengthy conversation in italian about what was expected of the government in the future when they ruled in italy as the interim mayor . both men insisted that the president would still

[427/1000]	" what ? " he asked in astonishment . i 'd forgotten all about his little brother , and he 'd never done anything so stupid . " i 'm hoping of putting a ring on your sister 's
[428/1000]	her lashes fluttered . " yes . " oh , wow . that was n't all he 'd felt , but he was pretty sure he did n't want her to know that . " here . let me
[429/1000]	" well , it ... " he caught himself , wondering what to say . " so ... i was up on the roof . when it went down . " " what did you do ? "
[430/1000]	" never , " he said again , taking hold of her chin , forcing her to meet his kiss . " you 're mine , and i 'm not letting you go . " he kissed her hard enough
[431/1000]	" what was that ? " zane asked . " do you smell that ? " he did n't bother to stop and turn around . " what ? " " the hair in the back .
[432/1000]	he 's more than a little angry - on me ! - but i 'm careful and take my time . " what do you see ? " i ask when i 've got him where i want him
[433/1000]	" i 'm scared ! " " i 'm not frightened , " said bod . " and there 's a shovel right here . we 're going by this way , to pick everything up . "
[434/1000]	" what ? " her lips quivered , and she swiped away the moisture like a pesky insect . " can you help me have fun ? there 's some nice places in this city you could visit today
[435/1000]	she turned to james , and he pulled her into his arms . the door slammed shut and the cold outside filled the air . ' and what is the meaning of this ? ' she said . ' and
[436/1000]	" no . i have an idea . " " what 's that ? " my entire body shakes with surprise , anticipation , and anticipation of what his next move is going to be . logan

[440/1000]	" do n't you dare . " i know the rules of this game <EOS> it 's a huge thing to know . my gaze jerks to dad 's face . he gets this look that says get to

[442/1000]	" i do n't know what to do , " kate was saying . " you can stay here . " " that 's okay . please , kate . i 'm really - " he stopped mid -
[443/1000]	his gaze swept over him . " you have that whole shifter vibe going on that only me , with his - " " your father . " " shit . " no hesitation . " tell me
[444/1000]	" i 'm okay . right now " , he said . he started to put his clothes back on but stopped , looked at her , and realized that she was still dressed , not standing up . "
[445/1000]	it had to be her . what she said made sense . the only reason she would n't explain was because she was n't convinced of what you felt for him . there were no indications of her feelings behind
[446/1000]	" because without a woman to hold i would n't be able to do anything to get you back . " when she continued to stare at him , i sighed . when she still did n't say anything ,
[447/1000]	" so , what 's up ? " i ask as i stand in the doorway , trying not to let my feet catch up to my body . evan is staring at something on the television . "
[448/1000]	" what i 'm saying is that it , for centuries , the djinn had been trying , for that matter , to thwart their plans . they created a new world , and everything was a result of its

[451/1000]	' i do n't even think my mother would like that , ' said itzy . ' probably not . ' seth shook his head and held his hand out towards her . she went to pass him the
[452/1000]	" well , why did n't you ever tell me ? " " because i thought you 'd hate it when i learned it was coming from you instead of me . now , what did you want ?
[453/1000]	and then he smiled his huge smile at her . it was one of those smile that brought his cheeks to life . " good morning , princess . " " good morning , prince . "
[454/1000]	" it is indeed that , " the dwarf confirmed . " it must have been the red star , " the girl said . " the blue star ? " asked the dwarf . " i hope
[455/1000]	" do whatever you have to do , baby . " " i 'm not having the baby , cole . i know what you said , but i need some time , and it 's up to me
[456/1000]	" yes . and on the last night of october i sent a note to my family about what we planned to do with you . i told the school that i told you to stay away . that i
[457/1000]	she had to talk to him . " of course , " she agreed . " my mother was gone years ago . " that was probably for the best . he started forward . out of
[458/1000]	" how bad do you think it would've been if i 'd said yes ? " she looked disappointed when he only laughed . " all right . a few weeks . " " and that is ?
[459/1000]	he looked at the crowd surrounding him . people , most of whom were white , held the same vacant expressions . at times they would nod , smiling , nodding , then look away again as if it had
[460/1000]	" do n't worry about it . he might just find something else you like . " " that might be worth worrying about . is he your boyfriend ? " he laughed . " why do you
[461/1000]	" a family business , which does n't require your immediate attention but is , unfortunately , now available ... can i escort you to your room , as i explained ? " her smile was shaky . her
[462/1000]	he got off the couch with the help of his new wife and walked out of the room , not even waiting for the nurses to shoo out his way before he left . his mother , then the nurse
[463/1000]	" ok . thank you . " i grabbed the photo of her that had been taken earlier up from my pocket and clutched it to my chest , feeling relief rush through me when i realized that it was
[464/1000]	" i feel like i do n't know anything at this point . " she said . " that 's because you do . " he replied . " do n't put it off . " taylor paused as
[465/1000]	or do they ever take a single bite ? do they even have to ? i opened and closed my mouth for about a full second . the smell of onions in sausage and garlic permeated the air .
[466/1000]	" never forget the little girls in that line , " he said , leaning down to kiss them on the cheek before putting his car key into the ignition and releasing the clutch and adjusting the roof . "
[467/1000]	" oh , god , " she whispered , closing her eyes . her knuckles white as she held her face in her hands . she knew better than to ask again about who had written those letters . it
[468/1000]	" no , so does she . i know what my next move will be , but if i want to stay here for as long as i want , then that 's my pr er og ative . i
[469/1000]	" get some rest , " she says , rising to her feet . " you 're going to need it , " she says , looking over her shoulder at me with sadness in her eyes . " we
[470/1000]	" i 'm not the <EOS> that you like who 's to be at midnight . it 's as much fun as it is life - steal er . everything in itself takes place . what was n't fun ,
[471/1000]	after leaving the conference room , jeff and the president of the united states of america followed the president into a rear hallway and went into a door that led into a small office . " thank you ,
[472/1000]	her hand was in his , and she wrapped her fingers around his wrist . she jerked him toward her . fury and rage turned to lust as they pressed their bodies together . fury licked over her neck
[473/1000]	" yeah , i guess so . what did that prove ? " " that these people are a lot more interested in physical fitness than just in survival . " " that 's sad , " she
[474/1000]	" you sure ? " the kid nodded eagerly . " yes ! give me a drink . " he began to climb into the cupboard . " see , there , he does n't know . "
[475/1000]	this is definitely not a good idea . i have n't been this bad with someone in a long time . and not just because he was on my planet . i should n't be turning him over to the
[476/1000]	the man in front - the one whose knife was pointed at colin 's temple - finally lifted his head . " listen to your men . they know what 's gon na happen . " yes , they
[477/1000]	" you like the idea ? " hunter asked , his voice hard and rough in the cool evening air . she gave him a hesitant smile . " i 've never cared much for the taste or the
[478/1000]	" you have to learn to trust me . remember , a vampire is weak , and that 's when you should be concerned about your own safety . you do n't know me and he does n't know you
[479/1000]	you get one shot , babe , i tried to explain . let 's get this done , i tried the door . no , jake said . what 's the problem ? you got a
[480/1000]	" but , your grace - " he cut her off . " just do it ! " " very well , your grace . oh , my lady , " she bowed . " you saw her
[481/1000]	" hi , sweetheart , " he said with mock confusion . " i 'd hoped an old man would make the time . you know , like when i asked that girl to marry me and she said yeah
[482/1000]	" he took his own life ? " the surprise left her speechless . " yeah . he told anyone who would listen to him in a few days about ... it . not a lot . like what
[483/1000]	" no , i 'm not , and i know it . " the next words out of his mouth were n't what she 'd hoped . she was still going to have to admit that he could really
[484/1000]	i know i can barely get around the bend . " okay . " " and it 's okay for me to ask you about that date on the plane . and that other night . " a
[485/1000]	" she wo n't ! " " ah , you are not a good man , you know , " he said <EOS> and that first kiss . and the last time we kissed . " i
[486/1000]	the woman shrugged . " he left to get to us . " " were our phones fried ? " " no . we 're not sure what they were or where they 're connected . can i
[487/1000]	what was this ? a christmas carol ? or a birthday gift from a stranger ? or it could be all of these things , she thought , and just as quickly it sunk in . she knew what she
[488/1000]	" you can ? " he did n't bother to answer that question . " all right . but if i need backup on some mission , can you do it ? " he gave her a
[489/1000]	i was n't sure what to think anymore . the feelings were on hold , though , because the clock around my heart was ticking too fast , and it hurt to be still so close to her . and
[490/1000]	" god ! " this was a high - speed motorcycle . it jumped sharply and kicked up sand . the driver kept a perfect track of them under the yellow - hot beam of the powerful headlight .
[491/1000]	" look , just drop it , " the colonel says . " i do n't have to listen to this . why are you trying to steal my thunder ? " but then he storms out of the
[492/1000]	" my dad is one of the best investigators i 've ever trained , " i said as i got closer . " i ca n't imagine what he - " i stopped myself , not wanting to be disrespectful
[493/1000]	he put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close , then the weight of his body pushed her into him and she let herself slump . her head hit his shoulder and the warmth of his body seemed
[494/1000]	" you did n't go for them , " ian said , his voice almost accusing . my mind whirred as my mind was in the right place . " ian , you were there as one of
[495/1000]	" hi mary . " " are you going somewhere ? " she asked , her voice still anxious . " i 'm just going to watch a movie , " he replied , feeling guilty that he
[496/1000]	" i 'm fine now . " " you - 're a liar . " " listen , " she continues , " i 'm not talking about this with you anymore . not now . not ever
[497/1000]	" why not ? " i stood in the front seat , my arms open , at the mercy of the steering wheel . " because ... " my voice choked , but i tried again . " because
[498/1000]	now be a good girl and give me an order . i looked over at the desk , at the papers scattered on the desk . i did n't need to make an appointment to have this conversation with
[499/1000]	" that must be it , " the man said , wiping his hands on a handkerchief . " you 're a liar , " said one of the other workers . they 'd gathered around , and were
[500/1000]	he saw the relief enter her face and wondered if that was the first sign the dream had been more than a dream . " dream , " he corrected himself . " dream . so far it has
[501/1000]	he grabbed a fistful of my hair and pulled my head back , forcing me to gaze into his eyes . " and she 's a pretty damn nice girl too . " his words cut me to the
[502/1000]	" a simple ' please ' would have suff iced . " he did n't sound as if he approved . and she wished , just once , that she was n't so bad off . chapter
[503/1000]	" i was just having the perfect time , " she said . " you sound funny . " " i do n't do well with lying . " " i have no doubt you 're lying
[504/1000]	" are you okay ? " a second later he asks . " not really , " i lie . although it does feel like someone 's ripping a hole straight through my chest . he pulls back
[505/1000]	" that 's fine , " she said cheerfully . " i know you 're not very talkative , but you want to hear about how your dad died . " " no , i appreciate that you 've
[506/1000]	" for the duration . " she nodded , and i pulled out a chair for her . " but that is n't going to happen anymore , is it ? the question is if it will become
[507/1000]	2 . 1 so far , i managed to stay out of trouble , which was n't particularly difficult considering that not only was the entire place haunted - everyone who 'd ever stayed there had been killed
[508/1000]	" would you , god in heaven , please help me ? " he saw the red light of the phone flash . and then the call was disconnected . he knew what the call meant , that he
[509/1000]	i looked at him and saw pity in his eyes but only for me . one of his hands fell to his lap , the other curled gently around the leather bound book . the others remained on his knee
[510/1000]	" is that a crime ? " " it 's hardly crime . by using me as an excuse to throw the baby away . you know , so you could get to know him better . "
[511/1000]	" no , no , i 'm done , " she said , patting my knee . " i 'm all ready to go myself . " the sun was setting and i did n't want to waste any more
[512/1000]	" this time , " she said , picking up the bag from the floor of the kitchen , " stay and play . " " go to bed , " i said , feeling so terrible that i
[513/1000]	' what ? i 'm a good warrior . ' ' if you believe what she told you , does n't this prove you are not a true warrior ? ' he asked . it was the young
[514/1000]	" they 're pretty special ones , the guys at the compound . i 've only heard of them because you 've told me , " " well , let me know if you need one , and we
[515/1000]	" i know . maybe not all of it . but maybe the story . " " the story . " " i 'm not going to say it 's bad . but i will say that i
[516/1000]	" i read a book . the old stories told on the floor of my grandfather 's house . " " you 're reading mine now . " silence in the room . she knew it was true
[517/1000]	* * * if i had to guess , it would be the very same creature that i 'd glimpsed in the graveyard outside the fence . it was something i had seen once or twice , but it
[518/1000]	she got up and walked over to the computer and sat down again . she picked up the remote control and turned the volume up a couple notches . now she heard faint but clear shouting . " hey
[519/1000]	the sun was slipping down to the east , but he could still just make out the lights from the strip club . he pulled up in front of the hotel and let the engine idle as he shut off
[520/1000]	she was a beautiful woman . the thought of her sleeping with him left me angry and a little disgusted . why does he have to be so damn sexy ? he would be her knight in shining armor
[521/1000]	" do n't i smell something ? " " what is it , love ? " he came up behind her and kissed her neck . " i ca n't believe he took her , i ca n't
[522/1000]	i waited as she worked her way up to the fifth floor on the other side of the conference room door . if she noticed my hesitation she did n't give it a second thought . as i watched her
[523/1000]	" okay ! " i replied , eager to change the subject before she said anything that could make me turn around in circles and break down . " so where 's jack ? " " he 's helping
[524/1000]	" would you like the second draft ? " " no , i 'm fine . i 'm up for the whole week . " mrs. miller passed her the second draft . " this is an excellent
[525/1000]	the entire house had been transformed by the late - summer heat to an already sweltering sauna - and i 'd only spent an hour in it in the freezing bathroom . from the very first moment i 'd entered
[526/1000]	" god , " she said . " you know what , peter , how about that ? " " what ? " " peter , my dear , i 've given you a very delicate situation .
[527/1000]	" i can be . " " you always are , " she said and smiled at him , still watching the horses for any sign that he would make a move . " but this week could be
[528/1000]	the first of the first wave began to strike . while the heavy cavalry was moving south ... three things began to make ben 's heart race : 1 . the thing that killed the other two cavalry
[529/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said . he was sorry ? not for cheating , of course - because she 'd kissed him and she 'd liked it , and she 'd had feelings . right ?
[530/1000]	" you 're here , " he said . " with the same reasons i 'm here now , i 'll see to it . " he eased his hand from mine and set me back down . i
[531/1000]	" i thought she 'd go back to the city . " " she said to find a place for the day and get her car back immediately . " " where if i 'm not able to
[532/1000]	" if that 's your choice , i guess so . " with a shrug he went to his truck , climbed in and slammed the door . the headlights shone like small spotlight beams up at him , and
[533/1000]	there was a moment of silence and then one of the men spoke . " jesus , you 're right ! " george and henry 's father said . he turned to the boy in the white coat
[534/1000]	" i can play a lot of cards if i keep you around . " i said . she raised her eyebrow . " what do you want me to say ? " " something like ' at
[535/1000]	" oh , you know , right next door , " i said . " on the second floor . right next to our room . " " oh , goo die , " he muttered , and then
[536/1000]	" so they were murdered , " said myrtle . " they were actually murdered . " " what ? " exclaimed jill . " how ? everyone goes out that door . they were just murdered . they
[537/1000]	mr. green seemed to have reached this conclusion . now it was his turn to shrug . " we are n't going to tell them anything - i hope . " " i do n't care whether you do
[538/1000]	then a man said , " just one more question . " " yes sir ? " " what happened when the boy started to cry on you ? " " i went to your office ,
[539/1000]	" i do n't think so , " i told her firmly . " i know my father . what i find is n't something i wish to experience . " " what you find is dangerous , "
[540/1000]	" i 'll tell the nurse . he lost a lot of blood and when i told him how cold he was , he suggested we give him something to be comfortable , " ethan said dryly . rachel
[541/1000]	his breathing hitched when he looked at her , and all of her senses leapt into overdrive . her ni * * les started to tingle , her inner core clenched instinctively , making her feel on the brink of
[542/1000]	" this is n't my plan at all . " " i suppose ... what ? you want to hide ? " max 's face was all innocence and he was hoping that sara would take things into her
[543/1000]	" i 'll come with you , " jack said . " i need to speak with everyone . " " no ! " jack was n't surprised when everyone in the room came to his defense at
[544/1000]	" ah . " he bowed low and turned back toward the kitchen . " now if i do not seem too abrupt , could you meet me for a few seconds in the family room and explain a few
[545/1000]	" well , i bet he was , " i mused . " seriously ? " " yeah , " i agreed . " i 'm talking about that kiss . wow . " " oh ,
[546/1000]	' hey ! ' i shout , snatching up the note without feeling if i 'm looking smart , and holding it between us . ' what was this ? ' ' an invitation to a girl 's show
[547/1000]	<EOS> which was after the party with the first guys , as i expected ; we were not the least bit focused on this . i smiled . " he was , like , totally right . he got
[548/1000]	i opened my eyes and saw it was a number . i knew when she was lying on the bed because i had left my phone in my bag . " hello ? " i croaked . "
[549/1000]	" i see you 've discovered your power now , " she said , with a knowing look . " an ability that could possibly be inherited . " " so my mother was not the only one who
[550/1000]	this trip to new orleans , the first trip out of the country since i 'd left georgia , had been a painful failure . i 'd spent it with the brothers ; now i was leaving her alone with
[551/1000]	" hey , they 're bringing you the food it wo n't hurt your stomach , " the nurse replied . " yeah , keep them coming , " i said , closing my eyes . and hope had
[552/1000]	" i said i would . do n't you answer my questions or you 'll regret it . " she did n't have to tell him twice . reaching across the table for her hand , he squeezed it
[553/1000]	" it 's just that i do n't want to believe this , " he said , " and i 've been running around seeing all kinds of liars and liars and liars ! but if that 's how anyone
[554/1000]	" do you love me ? " he asks . " yes . you know that , do n't you ? " " maybe , " he answers , " or maybe it 's just the two of
[555/1000]	" so tell me about the accident . " " i should n't have . it 's your fault as much as mine . we were both drunk and when we got back we were both driving recklessly .
[556/1000]	" that 's fine , " said the doctor politely . " i hope it 's alright with the girls . " " yes , i 'll just take a quick shower , " said sarah , picking up
[557/1000]	if i did n't run from him already , i 'd have already run away . " so you 'll be leaving ? " he asked , looking a bit disappointed . " <EOS> the day 's i
[558/1000]	and to kill him . as it turned out , none of the warriors were all that happy about that idea : first , they had to make sure the demon survived . then they had to do everything
[559/1000]	" what was that ? " he asked . she smiled . " nothing . " " you better tell me now . " they watched the sun take the last rays over the trees and fade
[560/1000]	" how is that possible ? " " i do n't know . " " so why have n't you been able to manipulate the visions ? why did n't you tell me this earlier ? "
[561/1000]	" if you run to it to save me , you will not make it past the door , " said a voice behind him . " if you give yourself up to me , i will give you up
[562/1000]	i sighed . " of course he 's here , dad . but this is crazy , i tell you . i 'm supposed to be in a normal relationship , with the guy of the hour , not some
[563/1000]	he did n't say anything more . he was n't sure what to make of her or whether he should start something and see what came out of it . " what do you want ? " " to
[564/1000]	the next stop was gat lin burg , and even though i was hungry , it still took me hours to find the most remote street that led to the border . i had reached a crossroads in the

[567/1000]	the phone was kept to his ear . " sorry to be saying this , but you 're making me nervous . " " what is it now ? " " you 've just saved my ass twice
[568/1000]	it was weird , considering what i 'd gone through years ago , that in the last week my life had gone from bad to worse . suddenly it also felt very good . i wanted that and
[569/1000]	" we do n't have to look , " said the man who 'd spoken first . " you will , will you " insisted the other . " no ! " protested the man with a look
[570/1000]	the smile fell from her face as the gravity in her eyes shifted . " i called the number again , " she moaned , " and i was relieved when i got finally told no one who answered had
[571/1000]	" so , " i ask , " you could n't be completely honest with me before now . " " i 'm sorry , " she says quickly , and when i raise an eyebrow , she goes
[572/1000]	" we have a deal . " " i already get to see your dad tomorrow night . i 've given him a re fund on the trip . he said to let him know i would see him
[573/1000]	" i was the one who found them . my parents had been involved with a group i took with me because it was the only way i could keep them safe . we took them off the farm ,
[574/1000]	" it 's a wonderful place , " mrs. me w t smiled . " i look forward to teaching you to ride horses . " he had no problem with that , because of his own experience this
[575/1000]	she was n't about to wait for him to take it back . " he was n't a good man , " she said forcefully . " and i 'm going to do better than just be his apprentice
[576/1000]	" i can not answer that . it is not my place . " " what about - " " it is no place for a man , but that is not my place . " "
[577/1000]	and he told them everything . there was no point in telling these people that thomas 's entire life and his greatest fear were gone - nothing could make him doubt his brother 's fai thfulness . he had no
[578/1000]	" you do n't have to play , " she said immediately . " it 's only a game . " i shrugged . her eyes widened . " sure it 's a game . you ca n't be
[579/1000]	" what the hell are you doing ? " the woman yelled , but he ignored her . he slipped out of the room , shutting the door hard behind him . the elevator took them to the basement
[580/1000]	" but i bet he - " " i do n't have any more questions for you . " at that , i 'm stunned , to say the least . he turns and strides from the room
[581/1000]	he 'd made her cry . " if you 're staying , that 's all right , " he said calmly , pulling his bag from the tree and placing it on the ground . " i did n't
[582/1000]	they 'd stayed outside some , going over stories and some of her little details while they 'd talked , but now they went back in to see her family . the other kids were up and about before bedtime
[583/1000]	at a loss for words , ben looked at me . his eyes were pleading . " because , " he simply said . i took his hand . i should n't have let him go . i should
[584/1000]	" good luck getting some , " she said as she turned toward the house . " it 's on a table outside . " when she nodded , he continued down the path . * * *
[585/1000]	" we ca n't wait for them all to eat that stuff before we decide , " i said , which was just as true . " we should probably go get more of it . " " so
[586/1000]	what did they need a gun for ? the gun lay a few feet away . something heavy clattered to the floor . it might have been a handgun . in his vision , he saw the two
[587/1000]	it was almost exactly on time . they left the cafe quickly . it was almost five forty , and the sun was beginning to set . it was almost ten o'clock at night , and everybody was tired
[588/1000]	i 'm afraid of the small things that make me feel so lost , so isolated . " a piece of it still needs a chance to work . " is it the truth ? is this only the
[589/1000]	i could feel my stomach turn . " this is perfect , " i told her , pulling out a small bag with my name written around it and a few items of jewelry for me and a few bottles
[590/1000]	the door opened . " i think i know who he is , " another man said , speaking in russian . the word sent a chill through me . i knew it out loud . alex was
[591/1000]	the lights dim . " where are we gon na go , " i ask . " we 're gon na have all the time in the world to see this up close , " he says .
[592/1000]	" i could get used to that . " i sigh . " but to get past me ? what does that mean ? " " it 's no leap of faith . i wanted him , i thought
[593/1000]	" you will . " a light tap on the window . someone was wearing a gun to scare the hell out of me . i do n't really have that much force i 'd hate for anyone to
[594/1000]	the girl is terrified when she hears her mother 's voice , but she lets her cry it out . " oh , please , " she begs , tears streaming down her face . " please , please ,
[595/1000]	" i understand . " " he must not know we are going . " " so you think he will just leave ? " " that i have n't even had the chance to finish my
[596/1000]	finally , the guards let them out and turned to us . " i believe you are the ones that captured the victim , " one said . " yes i am , " said caleb . "
[597/1000]	he was always afraid to reach for his wife , his wife i , lest fear or weakness overcome his body and i have broken his heart . he was afraid of losing me forever and with the thought of

[751/1000]	" yes ? " i asked . " why on earth would i want to come here ? " he asked . the world was spinning too fast , too long ... i needed time . i needed away
[752/1000]	" they made another turn and crashed right on schedule , " the agent said . " at least that 's what we picked up . " " thank you , " holden said , standing up . "
[753/1000]	" i do n't think so , " i said . " how 's that possible ? " he said , as if i 'd suddenly told him that an empty room had suddenly had a feeling and i
[754/1000]	" it 's not entirely against the law , at least not yet , " i told him , because , frankly , i could n't leave him with this as a threat . " but i do n't think
[755/1000]	" i do n't know ! " he grabbed my hand and drew it to his lips , then kissed the back of it , his breath against my skin making me shiver all over . " i
[756/1000]	" you 're just gon na sit here . " " i think we 're both mad right now . " " no , you 're right . " he smiled , and shrugged , not letting
[757/1000]	" all right . we all went like mad to the farm . we all made our way from there without anyone the wiser . " then when we stopped by the farm we found that the people of
[758/1000]	he shrugged a shoulder , as if it did n't matter when she was over . " you were ... " she tried again . " you were upset afterwards . it was hard for me to not leave
[759/1000]	it is not enough to believe , but it is enough to leave me filled with joy . there she is , out of control , with the power to destroy me . her breath pants in and out
[760/1000]	" do n't get yourself lost , " he said . " let 's get out of here and see if we hear any more reports of an attack . " they moved quickly , and soon found themselves
[761/1000]	so i did this and moved to the other side of the table . " so , this man , this vance lawson , is your father . " vance 's hand moved to his chest , his
[762/1000]	only it 's not right ! she thought . but did she care ? she found all things in her life threatening to shift in and out of balance , almost impossible to see , impossible to prevent .
[763/1000]	" and just who said i am going to be playing for the audience ? " " you will be . " the man gestured toward the big picture window where rows of young people stood in the center
[764/1000]	" you must have brought a very heavy bag of salt to the bar . and a bottle of wine . " " it was the only place open at this time of night . " " thank
[765/1000]	" well , and you 'll be coming with me , so they wo n't see you , " i said . " she wo n't ? " he was practically dripping with anxiety . " she wo
[766/1000]	" you 're not on duty ? " " nope . " she took a deep breath . " it 's just that i can already feel the heat of the fire for most of the day , and
[767/1000]	she looked away , blinking fast , like she 'd just felt a bolt of lightning . " fuck , i hate hospitals . " " now who 's lying ? " a voice said behind us .
[768/1000]	" with all due respect , we will be paying a premium . " " i really do n't think that 's necessary - what i said was true . the government has never had a major case of
[769/1000]	" i 'll be right back . i want to check on something , " he muttered , then grabbed me and pulled me out the door . i started to protest but he turned me around , effectively
[770/1000]	" there she is , " a familiar voice said , and i recognized it . he hurried away to meet the others , but i had no choice but to follow him . as i could see him
[771/1000]	" his eyes are closed and i ca n't leave , he ca n't even breathe , i have to help him . he 's bleeding . " " will you hold him right here like we did ?
[772/1000]	" <EOS> " " no , can it be called just because he 's a friend , " and that last part came out with the first two more , " yes and no , what 's happened to
[773/1000]	his cheeks grow pale . " no , that wo n't be necessary . i 'll set it up . " she did n't hesitate . " thank you . now , where is he ? " "
[774/1000]	" no . no . i do n't want you to be miserable . " " but you 're not . " her fingers found the waistband of his jeans and unfastened them , with deft motions .
[775/1000]	" actually , i am a different breed of species . " her fingertips tapped as she toyed with the earring . " now , please do n't try and make me do this again . " " you
[776/1000]	what happened after that is the best way to tell the story of his life . he was so angry he thought his soul could be ripped from his body and he could n't make it stop . he cried
[777/1000]	" and the name ! " " all right , " smith snarled . " he did n't name the president . but i 've seen that video . even if it was a ruse , what was he
[778/1000]	" i am , " she said . " good girl , " he said , standing up and slapping her hands . she felt the warmth of his warm skin and wondered if they 'd ever feel dry
[779/1000]	" but surely there 's a way to save the queen ? " " i could take her to the pit with me , but we 'd have to face the king , and that would be a challenge
[780/1000]	they were in a small alcove lit with an arrangement of candles , a great blaze in the grate . a couple were walking around , but all of them were naked except for a patch of blue cloth on
[781/1000]	" i 'm sorry , i just do n't know what to tell you . i just do n't know . all i was doing was taking a piece apart . " " oh , " i say softly
[782/1000]	" okay , " was all he said and i looked at him and grinned . no , not a smile at all . it was like he just realized it and did n't completely figure it out .
[783/1000]	" oh . that 's that . " her arms fell to her sides and she scowled at alex . alex 's face must have come close to touching hers as he chuckled lightly just before answering , " yeah
[784/1000]	she smiled reassuringly and looked at sam in the mirror . " it 's all okay sam , i 've been through this before . you need to let him go . " " no baby , i 'm
[785/1000]	" do n't worry , miss , " he said quietly , tucking the book into my hand . " we 'll manage . " i was walking off , thinking of his last words , as the door
[786/1000]	" this is the best you 've gotten so far ? " " not going too well , " she said . " i think this might have been for show , or as the case may be ,
[787/1000]	" i 'm not from arizona . " " sure you are . i had your picture dropped on my doorstep the other night , and i know this place . and i am totally aware of you .
[788/1000]	ryan took his time , moving up and down her body . * * * after the two tests , nicole walked him out of her room and closed the door . she was being unusually quiet ,
[789/1000]	i did n't make it far before i hit a small wall that knocked me to the ground . the wall behind me folded in like my spine . before i could react to the pain or to the
[790/1000]	it must have been a year since i had seen or heard from him , because i had no idea he was living in california . i did n't want to interrupt his conversations or spend time with him ,
[791/1000]	" that 's right , " she breathed , clutching at the back of the couch and gripping the pillows with white knuckles as pain rippled throughout her middle . his eyes grew wider with each breath he took
[792/1000]	" that 's not smart , " he grumbled . " what is ? " " not playing the game . we are both adults here . we have agreed to stop playing games and go to the
[793/1000]	you do not belong on this planet . there is more out there , more bad things , more monsters . i tried to talk to him about it , though . it bothered him more than
[794/1000]	" i know , " kate said . " i always wanted to be a nurse but i guess i always felt it would never work , not with such a big family , after my father and mother passed
[795/1000]	" no ! it means no ! " i say , jumping into a panic , afraid he 's going to ask me for absolu tion . " i ca n't - the one i should 've been given -
[796/1000]	" yes , " she said . " i was afraid of that . " " i 'm sorry , " reacher said again . a moment passed , and then she looked over her shoulder again .
[797/1000]	" yes , you were . i do n't know why . we 'll have to talk about it again when i 'm sober . " " ah , okay . well , that 's an easy answer .
[798/1000]	but it was n't over . not when he could feel himself growing hard at her soft smile . " stop , " he commanded , putting her hand on her hip and stepping back for another step . damn
[799/1000]	but my dream did n't come true ! no sooner had i fallen , did i grasp a grip on the wall , and then i was out of existence the entire length of time when i felt only blackness
[800/1000]	" who were you talking to ? " i asked as i started walking toward her . i needed to get back into my house right now . why did i have to come home early ? she needed
[801/1000]	" i could shoot you . " " you can try , " i replied coldly . he grimaced . " i 'll warn you this one time , we are n't playing fair anymore . if you
[802/1000]	" no , " i whispered . he leaned in and growled , " i want to fill you with steel , baby . " that was such a nice compliment i was n't going to be able
[803/1000]	the door opens , and in walks a tall , slender man . " i went to the market and forgot my appointment , " he says . he can not be the one i 've been in contact
[804/1000]	" she called . " " oh ? " " yes , " he said , pulling out his wallet to pay for our seats . we walked up to the front of the carriage while the driver
[805/1000]	she pulled the bottle from her neck . " what 's happening ? " he knew he could n't save her . a flash went before his eyes . silver flames flickered a few feet away , dancing
[806/1000]	" here ! " she held up the package and handed it to him like a child offering a treat . " not you , too , " he said and offered it back . " i
[807/1000]	" here we go again , you and me both , " he muttered , his head coming up to meet mine . " get your ass up , " i ordered . he grinned and the muscles
[808/1000]	' there 's really not much we can do here , ' she says , as if those are the only things you can do , just that one thing . ' it might be best if you left now
[809/1000]	jake got up and paced like a little boy waiting for miss smith to come out and tell him to go home . jake watched over the family from the street . nobody seemed to notice melissa , but
[810/1000]	" yes , madame . it 's a private job , that 's the job . " it was difficult to believe anyone could be so good - natured - so honest - so at life . " i was
[811/1000]	he kissed her . her breath came so hard that she could n't speak . she was n't sure if it was because he would n't stop , or if it was because his mouth was so sweet and sensual
[812/1000]	" there 's this guy - " " he 's not a guy , " i say , cutting him off . " i know . " when i look up and see his jaw clench , i
[813/1000]	" i 'm sorry ... " i feel around on the nightstand for the bedside lamp , and realize he left the one on earlier . " i 'm so sorry . " i do n't know why i 'm
[814/1000]	" it is very hard work , is n't it ? " " it gets hard when you do n't want to be near the subject for fear of the subject being discovered , " i said . i
[815/1000]	" one down , two to go , " i said , and put my own drink down as well . " two red apples , too , " i said . the light from the hallway was faint
[816/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " she said . she had n't really thought ahead ; she 'd just put her heart into it , and she 'd put his . even now she felt sorry that she 'd
[817/1000]	i take the keys when he places them in my palm and lock it . " i 'm giving you another chance . i 'm not asking you to kiss me before you realize it . i 'm just giving
[818/1000]	and now he 'd have a chance to put some distance between their desks before he 'd have to see either of them again . * * * nick could feel the strain in his body , the
[819/1000]	" no . " " no ? it has to be . " " do you know what your dad said , sam ? he said one who goes by the name of a real genius is a
[820/1000]	he was still leaning against the doorjamb . " so , where are you ? " his eyes were deep blue , so deep it was like diving into a swimming pool . i could n't put a name
[821/1000]	" yeah , of course . it 's so not cool " . " i have n't been in the kitchen long , " he said . " not like you need to . " and that line
[822/1000]	they started the walk east and west , hoping to find some trace of grace . * * * " i have some good news , " the doctor said after two days walk . they had
[823/1000]	there were no windows . he looked around the room , noticed the other two chairs , the carpet , the chair on the desk . the light came from a small window near the floor . the window had
[824/1000]	" come on . let 's go away , " i beg . a laugh is deep in his chest . " go away , bitch ? " he asks . it 's low , but i feel it
[825/1000]	the first two guards had obviously been stationed in the corridor for some time , like the rest . but , through their chatter and their attitude , i did n't hear any warning . instead , i got a
[826/1000]	i saw him in the restaurant when i left , standing by the bar . as soon as he saw me he got up and looked left then right . i turned my back to him and hurried over there
[827/1000]	" are you all right ? " " fine . you ? " he gave her an unreadable look then chuckled slightly . " i 'm fine , " he said . " you look like you
[828/1000]	" stop ! " she cried . " please ! do n't do this ! do n't - " but then she saw george 's face , saw the dark shadows beneath his eyes , saw his hand raised
[829/1000]	' that 's it . i 'm not going to let you go in there alone . ' she glanced at the stairs , her eyes pleading . ' i do n't know , i really do n't .
[830/1000]	" a bit ? " says he , turning round to face me . " some , maybe a bit more . nothing permanent . we 'll get them up in the hills , in a bit . and the
[831/1000]	" only a fool trusts the emperor , " ta mika said with a wry smile . " i hope you are right . " " we must let lu an ren know . first , we must
[832/1000]	the phone goes dead . fuck , i think . she 'll start talking and i 'm still out here , alone . before i can even consider what i 'm doing , i 'm out the door .
[833/1000]	" he must have killed two more . " " what are you talking about ? there were two bullets in the man 's heart . " " the dog must have attacked him . " "
[834/1000]	he just sat there with his eyes closed and his hands in his lap but i did n't hear anything . " you see him . " my stomach gave an audible lurch and i threw back my
[835/1000]	" they are . " a faint rumbling of thunder sounded . the man looked at the phone . " i called your cell . it 's back there , " sam told him and was n't sure
[836/1000]	my shoulders squared . maybe i 'd been paranoid . maybe i was a crazy , high - school er who took her car down the side of the road and found herself driving into a dark , deserted alleyway
[837/1000]	" we 'll be ready it seems , " she said . " do you want to come down and swim with us ? " as she put her shoe up on the railing we could tell she did
[838/1000]	" the big car , " she said quickly . " okay , what are we going to do with the big car ? " " throw it out . " " that 's no picnic .
[839/1000]	she shifted her head side to side . " stop the attack ! " the captain ordered . " we have no other weapons as of yet , " he stated . " the ships ' cannons are down
[840/1000]	" we 're taking 'em to court , and there goes the business end . " " i still ca n't believe you killed him , " olivia whispered . " no matter what his motive was - killing
[841/1000]	" you 'll get over it , " he said . " take some time to think about it . " " i know , " i replied . my voice was not quite steady , and now i
[842/1000]	he put the bowl on the counter and opened the cupboard . " this is stuff i got from the bakery i owned while in foster care . the other stuff i grew up with . " he pulled out
[843/1000]	she blinked up at him in confusion . " then why was she in your bed ? " " because we need to be getting back . " " but why - " " we 'll figure
[844/1000]	" you can tell us something , " said grant . " there 's a whole lot more going on now . we 're here because we were looking for <EOS> , but we do n't care if we
[845/1000]	" how many more come ? " " enough , i think . " " they ca n't show themselves , can they ? " " no , none at all , " he said .
[846/1000]	and that 's when thomas took that moment to give thomas the greatest miracle the gods had ever given to him . in the midst of his despair , thomas thought for a moment of the stars , his
[847/1000]	" not my cup of tea , " he said , but the light changed quickly and the doors opened wide . she turned the key in the ignition and pulled out of the car park . the door
[848/1000]	' you 've got the word . ' ' your mouth ! ' ' my lips in order to speak . ' ' good . will you listen to me , then ? ' kendrick stared
[849/1000]	he is standing next to me , his hands palm down on my shoulder . his gaze is focused on the house above our heads , and i watch , fascinated , as it grows even more quiet . in
[850/1000]	1 gray 1 half - baked 1 black 1 rolled 1 man 's 1 ho le shot - colored 1 be calmed 1 stretched 1 in u it 1 dust
[851/1000]	" you can come back , though . even if we were n't already friends , " jess murmured , taking a step toward him . " no , i have to go . my dad says he might
[852/1000]	she swallowed hard . " you must be a hero , " she said . " how could you know that those poor women would die in your arms ? " " because they were with child . "
[853/1000]	" you 'll be fine , sweetheart . " i give her a quick kiss , and then get to work . to hell with being cold . it might be a while until i can get rid of all
[854/1000]	he grinned and shrugged and offered him the pillow - a nice way of saying not guilty as charged . " thanks . that makes it all better , " zane said , his voice tinged with gratitude as
[855/1000]	for a moment his heart slowed just a bit . the girl was n't even the least bit of a wolf ! the last moment before the inevitable was when a wolf made a meal out of you
[856/1000]	he had to be mad . not sane . this was insane . i knew that now , and i was glad . he would n't understand that a person who was under some kind of torture device would n't
[857/1000]	" you got it . " nick shrugged his jacket off . " if you 're going to spend your weekend up here at the lake , i suggest you take care of yourself . we do n't have
[858/1000]	he gave her a withering glare . " how many times do i have to tell you that it 's impossible to work together when one has to live with a mind - blowing orgasm ? " he tossed her
[859/1000]	he started to head out , but there was one thing he needed to do first before he took her to bed . " i can drive you home . if you want . " " that would be
[860/1000]	" it 's all in the air ! " exclaimed tommy , jumping up and down and waving his hands back and forth . " we need a ship of our own ! " cried nick . "
[861/1000]	" what 's going on ? " she demanded , her voice raspy with tears . she was n't sure just how much more she could take . " i think you and dad are up to something ...
[862/1000]	" i ca n't ... i need a moment . " without a word , he bent his head and brushed a kiss across my lips , so fleeting it looked almost as if it had n't been there
[863/1000]	" no . i 'm sorry , i have a surprise for you . " " i do n't want you to surprise me . " " i know that , but you do trust me . "
[864/1000]	" i 'll meet you at one o'clock ... " i said as i left her house and watched as her white maz da drove off . " come on . let 's go for a walk . "
[865/1000]	" and you 're talking about a piece of her a man has ? " " he 's also a man i loved , " she added , in a whisper . " i think it 's time we
[866/1000]	her eyes narrowed , and her lips trembled . " you 're a thief , a cut throat , your uncle - " " i 'm the man who stole your mama 's virtue for her ? "
[867/1000]	" well , there you have it , " she says . " so that means you can find out what the hell is going on . and the person who wanted my mother killed ? well that 's even
[868/1000]	" it 's for you " " and for you . " " you could 've just called last night and let me know . we 're good together " " i just could n't be in
[869/1000]	" and no one knows about the letter , even before that , " said frank . " what 's there , then ? " asked maggie . " no one with a better understanding , frank ,
[870/1000]	" so you were thinking of being the one to kiss me , " she says , staring off into space . her voice is so quiet i can barely hear it . her lips are tingling and the sight
[871/1000]	" is he still going to be here ? " i asked . " he may come back here , but he 's staying here for a while until everything has settled , " said mom . " he
[872/1000]	he turned and gave her a stern look . " stop this nonsense . i need to speak to the steward . " she sighed and turned her focus elsewhere . perhaps she ought to give the man back
[873/1000]	just then , they heard the noise of the door , and they both jumped up . " come on , come on , " she urged , starting to pace . " time to pull out the guns
[874/1000]	" you could call the cops . this could seriously get expensive . " " it 's not that easy . " she pauses . " the cops are coming . and they 're not a very patient bunch
[875/1000]	" you 're taking everything - " she began to say , but was interrupted by her cousin 's voice cutting through the chaos . " and he 's probably right about that ! " " what ?
[876/1000]	his hands were still shaking . please , not again , not again . he stood and opened a desk drawer before letting her resume . he returned for his briefcase and briefcase and handed her a small
[877/1000]	he felt her body heat under his , her breath warm in the chill of the air . slowly her eyes open . he placed a tender kiss against her cheek . " ' bye , baby , "
[878/1000]	my father stands abruptly . " tell your mother to take her ass in the kitchen right now . i 'll be there in forty - five minutes . " he turns to walk away but stops just before he
[879/1000]	" and here i thought we were going to find it from the top . " she smiled . " now i know the secrets of our little chat . thank you so much for my warning but now
[880/1000]	2 i 've heard of you , but i 've never seen you around here before . you 're very smart to work here . his eyes were still on the movie screen . he turned so his eyes
[881/1000]	" i have every right to do so . " " when i saw that poor guy , you had changed from you <EOS> you , you had turned into your old self , and you were in the
[882/1000]	he frowned when he saw my reaction . i felt like an idiot , because i liked him so much , he just surprised me . " you got some of the wrong house , " i told him
[883/1000]	" uh , yeah , i imagine she is . i 'd like to go to your place , too <EOS> hard lemonade and a little breakfast and all . " brad nodded his head . " okay ,
[884/1000]	" it 's not your job to decide , " i said . " i 'm <EOS> right now . you have the gift , and i believe it . is that so bad ? " " everyone has
[885/1000]	" thanks , " i say to him , hoping he 'll forget this silly conversation at this point . it 's driving us bat ty . " you want me to call him , too ? "
[886/1000]	" what 's going to happen next ? " i asked . " things are already on track , " said reginald , trying to be nonchalant . i understood his logic . they worked it out .
[887/1000]	" i can see why he would have a hard time believing that . but you can forget about it . the only reason i 'm not so upset by what happened is because it 's impossible . "
[888/1000]	" i 'll keep busy , " said peter grimly . " you 're crazy to spend weeks in a building site , and not have you ever done anything ! " said harding angrily . " what in
[889/1000]	' that 's a question you should ask him yourself , ' said the vampire . ' are you planning to get rich ? ' ' no . ' ' what do you mean , no ? '
[890/1000]	" yes , it 's a great little place , " i said to him as i glanced at the big picture . " i 've always loved it . so you guys moved here from california . you must
[891/1000]	" yeah ? so what 's wrong ? " i sighed heavily . " nothing . " i hesitated . " we 're moving in together . " his eyes widened , then crossed over . " you
[892/1000]	" this is a school of thought . " he laughed . " if you 're not my father , tell grandma about this . i 'm exhausted by now . " i sighed . " alright ,
[893/1000]	" i 'm sorry i missed your introduction to the new world . " " it 's okay , " i managed to mumble . it was n't . i did n't really have anything to say at all
[894/1000]	the next day , his parents had all walked into the house and they were all staring at amy . they were all smiling . but amy did not feel happy . " i will stay away this time .
[895/1000]	" what ? " mom shoots me a look , like i 've just uttered the biggest lie for her entire family . " are you high ? " gage gives a little shrug . " just thinking about
[896/1000]	she turned from getting into the shower to take a look at the way she looked , dressed in the same clothes the last time . and there she was in his arms with one hand pressed deep in his
[897/1000]	" what would you say if i proposed that we go down to the station ? " he asked . " what do you say ? " he asked me all at once , and i know it is a
[898/1000]	" good afternoon , mrs. taylor . i know your son is out here , " julia said . " i figured as much , " mrs. taylor said and followed julia into the kitchen , " i hope
[899/1000]	this <EOS> and other , that they had to do with the thought of becoming something we had lived before our birth - but as they came on a similar branch - " is life not bad . i do
[900/1000]	i get so lost in the act for a long time that the clock sounds a warning , but i did not notice . then i hear it : a siren . she 's coming , somehow . footsteps cross
[901/1000]	" good . " " yes , yes . " she said , pushing him back . " you must n't move . i 'd break your neck . " " i 'm certain no one will ever
[902/1000]	" not really . " he stopped , his legs still planted , his eyes wide . " but it was way past what i expected when i woke up here on the farm . " " i remember
[903/1000]	her hand drifted to her abdomen protectively , as if afraid of what it contained . " some of my family has a certain ... reputation , not to mention a certain reputation of wealth . but it 's rare
[904/1000]	" i have n't told him about the baby , " she said , shaking her head . " we do n't know for sure yet . " " then i 'll tell him today , " he told
[905/1000]	" like this ? " i nodded . " that 's the best . " he lowered his mouth to my neck and nuzzled my skin . " i 'm going to go get us some more beer
[906/1000]	i 'm a good boy . just a boy . she wanted nothing more than for her mother to go to sleep . " look , mom , " she said in a flat voice , " can i
[907/1000]	" what 's that mean , you lost something ? " " i 've got this thing that slows us down for a few days , but it 's pretty handy right now . " the others watched
[908/1000]	she had n't even realized she was crying . then she 'd heard what she worried could very well have been a dream - or a cry of a frightened child . for the rest of the night , she
[909/1000]	<EOS> but i 've seen plenty of life and then death . <EOS> and i 'm one of the dead that made a grave for six days . but in the most un wholesome way , in that slow spin
[910/1000]	" now , now , " the chief said in a voice so dry it almost sounded like a chuckle . " no need for such a nervous breakdown . i 'm still trying to process everything that happened .
[911/1000]	they stopped just shy of the door , the large man bringing her close again . " i want to know your name , " he demanded . " miranda , " she sobbed , not able to
[912/1000]	i could n't help but laugh . " do n't take this the wrong way , man , but you 're right . i need to start training in the gym . i 've been working out more just as
[913/1000]	" there 's something else you might care to know , you 've been invited to the grand ballroom at the palace . " " for ? " i repeated mildly . " to attend a ball tonight
[914/1000]	two there 's nothing my mother can do to help . * * * sometimes just having a little bit of something to take back to you . a little bit of the joy that was once
[915/1000]	that 's when the phone vibrated . " yes . " another explosion ripped through the room , echoing through the empty house . " you son of a bitch ! " he slammed the phone back
[916/1000]	' where do you see himself then ? ' i pointed along the canal . ' in paris , ' she said . ' he 's booked the room at the hotel , which is part of a deal
[917/1000]	" no more . i 'm not getting emotionally involved with you . " " where are your clothes tonight ? " " by the bedroom door . " she pointed to her closet , but i did
[918/1000]	" yeah , it just seemed like ... when it comes to my boyfriend , i do n't really know . i just do what i think i should in a professional sense , and i 'm not just saying
[919/1000]	" ' cept that you do n't agree with what he 's doing and i think you 'll agree with it , " she said , a hint of a smile . " you do n't seem like you have
[920/1000]	this time , the scream was louder than before , and she knew it was coming from her . " dammit , dad , did you hear ? do you hear him ? " " he 's not here
[921/1000]	" she does indeed . " " it 's a bit disturbing . " " it , and you knew all along . why do you have to get up at the crack of dawn to walk with
[922/1000]	' no , ' he said gravely . ' not yet . your task is to bring ' er in . ' the captain 's only reply was the merest of nods . the captain thought the little
[923/1000]	" damn , where 'd you get yourself into ? " she tried to laugh . " this is crazy , blake . do n't ask me how i got myself into this mess . it 's nothing .
[924/1000]	" we shall not be able to catch the killer , " the lady said stiffly . " the killer has to be found first . " " thank you , " said the older woman . she rose
[925/1000]	" i have it on good authority that someone did , " mary jo said <EOS> f i ddle two days ago , as if the information had been given . the same person had stood by his bed
[926/1000]	i sit at the desk and flip through the emails . there are dozens of them from jack : jill jack what did she tell you ? jill that she wanted to make up
[927/1000]	his eyes flew open and he took a step toward me . " what are you doing here ? " he demanded . " you ca n't possibly be here . " " yes , i am . i
[928/1000]	" i asked you a question , " she murmured out loud to nobody in particular , focusing on the fact that the two of them were sitting a quarter mile apart on a bench . maybe it was just
[929/1000]	he walked along the concrete walkway running the length of the building . he listened for sounds from inside but did n't hear anything . he went to the door 's opening , looked inside , and entered the room
[930/1000]	" no - just tired . not at all like you , " she began to say . " what happens when i do n't want to talk about what or who i am ? you must believe i
[931/1000]	" yes . " " good . now tell me about it . " " it 's ... nothing really . i did n't think everything was going to fall into place . " for the first time
[932/1000]	and there were that six inches of pale skin . her mouth was more curved and fuller , her breasts larger . one was wider than the other and lower . and yet , those were her only curves .
[933/1000]	' but it 's at the airport . where can i drop you ? ' ' that 's just it . if you 're still up there , that is , call me and i can get there right
[934/1000]	i would n't have believed it happened in real life , so like my dream then i thought about how if i could have been there , i would have stayed at that little old lady 's house for the
[935/1000]	" i 'm not your enemy . " " you had me under house arrest all those months ago . i knew exactly who you were . " " but you could n't prove . i was too
[936/1000]	" i 'm fine ! " i shout , but my voice is drowned out by the thunderous boom of my car door closing . i turn to see jake 's face <EOS> i 'm surprised to see him watching
[937/1000]	" i 'll let your brother know , " he said . ian turned on his heel and left the room . the next two and a half minutes seemed to pass in excruciating slowness . the room was
[938/1000]	this is no time for small talk . it 's time for action . i grab my phone , hit the button to roll it up , just like mom used to when mom brought me here . pressing the
[939/1000]	" or we leave , " i said , trying to keep my tone light despite the disappointment in my stomach . " what does it matter if you leave or not ? " " everything does n't matter
[940/1000]	" good idea , " he says , before stepping out into the sunshine and holding out his hand for me . i take it . a strange feeling makes me lift my head off his shoulder to look
[941/1000]	she bit her lip and kept them there . " what do you think , baby ? " that husky , sexy voice asked and his hand shifted up the side of her breast . two fingers .
[942/1000]	" i 'm with you now , " said the voice on the other end of the phone . " what are you saying ? you 'd try and stop me too , but you 'd miss the fun .
[943/1000]	i turned my gaze down the way we 'd come . his mother and father ' were talking in the distance , probably wishing he were a little boy again . " so what 's my future to you
[944/1000]	" <EOS> i 'm sure as a girl . with the right money . but that 's no excuse , mom . " beth smiled , and started to get up . " not like those lawyers , now
[945/1000]	" just like that ? " i asked , bewildered . she smiled again , this one very sexy , and then handed some bills to me . " get whatever you need . i have a bus .
[946/1000]	if he did , he 'd laugh in her face and he knew it . they 'd talked about this when he was a kid , and it had been a game to him . she walked up to
[947/1000]	" so , it was to keep him busy . " " yes , something like that . " " and ? " " he was never very distracted . he met me at a diner ,
[948/1000]	" my god . i never thought i 'd say this , but everything about you is perfect . " he kissed her mouth in that exact same slow , sensual way , and then ran his fingers across her
[949/1000]	both he and connor were staring at her as if she were about to disappear , as if they 'd given up hope of ever seeing their angel again . finally with a sigh , he shrugged . "
[950/1000]	" i 'm afraid so . " she knew she sounded like a coward . " you did n't stop the blood . " he backed away from her . " you would have held it off , even
[951/1000]	he drew in a breath and exhaled , his expression one of shock . so she 'd caught him completely off guard . of course , she was no stranger to surprises , but this was new . or maybe
[952/1000]	" when ? " " oh , when ... " he looked down at his hands , which suddenly felt incredibly cold . " when you killed the vampire ? " he did n't answer .
[953/1000]	" you ca n't just leave him like that ! " " i ca n't just leave him , i gave him my word that he would never be hurt . " " what do you , your
[954/1000]	" that 's right , you need only say what you need . " " so can you ? " he gave her a lopsided smile . " so long as i get to pick the clothes and
[955/1000]	" they tried to kill you ! you ca n't just go back to kill them all . how could you ? " the light was fading fast . the darkness , it seemed to give off more and
[956/1000]	" i was gon na ask the same thing of you ! " " wait ! just wait until she starts spouting off that ridiculous song of hers , " zach said , laughing . lexi knew she
[957/1000]	how could those feelings so quickly change , as quickly and fully as in the last few days ? a single look from him , and my knees almost gave way . " why ? " i wondered aloud
[958/1000]	" me , too , " she agreed , and got up to pack her suitcase . back at his place , he told them both he would be ready to go on a new case the following week
[959/1000]	" one thing is certain , " said richard . " i 'm sure of it . " " and that is ? " " that we will soon find out . " chapter 1 12 9
[960/1000]	" are you sure you have a passport ? " he asked her . " yes , i 've always had one but have never had the freedom to buy it . it 's been well known that these
[961/1000]	" you 've got to be kidding me . i swear , i could kiss you and look beautiful , if that was your intention . " she had n't seen him like this this since he 'd run
[962/1000]	this was the second time in the past few days that the girl had been put at ease . though perhaps it was that she was aware of his eyes upon her , she did not seem to have any
[963/1000]	" you were just messing with her . " " am i ? well enough that you just pushed me into kissing her , but that 's okay . i know you can be dangerous when you 're angry
[964/1000]	i ran in through the kitchen . " where 'd you go ? " a voice asked from the living room . " i was just ... " the back door to the living room exploded open and
[965/1000]	" all right , if that 's your mind , i 'll just put on a little weight . it will make you feel better . they only made it ten pounds over , and it was easier to get
[966/1000]	so i said the first thing that came to mind . " and you were scared shitless . " she had no response , but a brief smile flitted across her face as she nodded , and i noticed
[967/1000]	suddenly , his brows shot up in surprise . " you want to talk about our relationship ? " a grin that seemed forced broke out across her cheeks . in contrast to the earlier shyness of the previous
[968/1000]	" i guess that 's what you get the credit for . at least you did n't lie . we all tried to stay out of the way while you hid behind the wall and hid behind your stupid pants
[969/1000]	i was n't sure what i 'd wanted , any of them . i did n't even realize i 'd said the words out loud until jake replied , " he wo n't ? " cole frowned at my
[970/1000]	" you want me to sit on your back ? " he laughs again . " no way , " i assure him . " but for god 's sake lay me down . " he lifts
[971/1000]	" the house is the property of the last duchess in du ville , " paul said . " it does not reflect on our place and our family . " " and that should be the end of
[972/1000]	i nodded once . " what about you , evan ? " pete asked , standing up . " and how long have you been stuck in the marines ? " " about three years , and one
[973/1000]	he turned and shouted to his followers again , this time in a voice that was no longer <EOS> that of the wind , " what brings me to you ? " his followers howled in reply . the
[974/1000]	" i 'm a good swimmer , " i tell her with a laugh . " well , maybe not by choice , but my mom is a huge sports fan . " " very ? is that why
[975/1000]	" i ca n't get it out , " she said , still confused by every word out of his mouth . she must have said it a thousand times before because he finally stopped and stared at her .
[976/1000]	" but how ? " " he 's from here . that 's why i 've never met him . " " but this is different . i asked you if you knew his name , but you
[977/1000]	" nothing ! " " i do n't like you . " she said , " it 's like you put me in a coffin and do n't let me talk . i 'm not going to say anything
[978/1000]	" i - i - " the words would n't come , so i just ran out of the kitchen , into the living room , then doubled over at the waist with my hands on my head , gasping
[979/1000]	" what is it ? " sean asked . " something for you , baby . " <EOS> , she was too thin . she was n't wearing that , because she liked to run . if they each
[980/1000]	" you killed each other . " i 'd done that . i 'd gone to his house , and i 'd killed him as he 'd stabbed me in the stomach with his bare hands . had n't
[981/1000]	" oh , my god ! " i stood and nearly fell forward onto the wet grass . he was right ; there was like nothing i had ever seen before . " let 's go back inside ,
[982/1000]	" my father was our teacher there . we used to do a lot of cross - country team 's work . i met a guy in the marines , before we even knew each other . one night he
[983/1000]	" i did n't want him telling you to run like hell . " " who was it ? " he shrugged and said , " she 's just looking out for you . " froelich paused
[984/1000]	" it 's not the same . i do n't know how to be with you . " his breath was warm against her face , and though she did n't want to touch him , she reached out and
[985/1000]	" uh , yeah ! " " i 'll keep you updated , " i said , my breath catching in my throat . now i really understood why i was so nervous . " uh , "
[986/1000]	" yes . i do . everyone knows she 's an expert at hiding her emotions . " but there 's a thread of doubt in his voice . and it 's the same uncertainty that my father has when
[987/1000]	as long as sam 's life was at stake , their marriage was a good match . " you 're pregnant , right ? " hunter asked . " no . " " you sure ? "
[988/1000]	" but my clothes are still here . " " oh , i meant my wardrobe , " she said . " what do you have planned ? " " i can start at work tomorrow at
[989/1000]	" she did not think that , " replied the emperor . " it was said by the elders that the white diamond had given her an idea of what she wished to do to help make the world stronger
[990/1000]	" how does one get out ? " sara asked . " there 's a trapdoor here in the attic . the thing was a long time ago . once the town was in turmoil , we hid under
[991/1000]	i blinked , " what ? " her lips twitched , " you know ! " i shook my head , " no . " i shook my head again , " not really . " "
[992/1000]	" we were supposed to stop to look at the map ? " jeff asked . " yup , " i said . " good . i 'm starving , " jeff grumbled . " they can
[993/1000]	' i do n't understand - ' ' did he give you any trouble , sam ? ' ' no , just one of those who get very sick . then the fever comes on , and the
[994/1000]	she 'd been able to see it had been cut by knife or knife blade without any of the other pieces being used . the thing was , she had been aiming for all the right parts , and nothing
[995/1000]	" are you sure it 's the best thing for you at this point ? " i ask . i 've known seth for several years and i always thought he 'd be a good addition to the team .
[996/1000]	" what do you want ? " " i hope you do n't mind me asking - after your daughter died - i 've never had an invitation to see your home this morning . " she blinked
[997/1000]	" but ... it must have been a terrifying experience for you . i can tell you it was when she pulled her arm away from your grasp and moved up into the air . " " what happened
[998/1000]	" can he swim ? " he asked . " he can go to the ends of your world . " " where 's your magic ? " " i did n't say we could n't learn
[999/1000]	" it was fun working out with you . if it 's a problem , you can come back with me and just say you need my help with some stuff . " " i 'll do that ,
