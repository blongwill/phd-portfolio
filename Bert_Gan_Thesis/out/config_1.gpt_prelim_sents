[8/1000]	because of the gun , they did n't know those men would n't kill her . in fact , without the two of them leaving the room , she was n't sure what to expect , in any event .
[9/1000]	and then the image of her was gone , replaced by the image of a tall , dark - skinned man with strong chin and tall cheekbones . he was wearing a tailored business suit and he stared out the
[10/1000]	" she wo n't leave . they want her even more than they do me ! " " wait , " <EOS> all she loves . " will she leave ? " if you mean do you get back

[13/1000]	no use in trying to get her to leave when she was n't willing . he did n't want to fight this battle . he held her close to him and let those emotions and fears wash over him
[14/1000]	" so we wo n't find him , " said wanda . and you ca n't find wanda , miss tick thought . for a moment the problem was n't solved , and the problem was solved , and
[15/1000]	" no worries . just need to check to see if i 'm getting the guy in her head . " " gotcha . come on over for a visit tomorrow . i could use a cup of coffee
[16/1000]	he stopped short , his gaze dipping to her mouth . then his eyes dipped to her mouth , followed the line of her jaw , and he went still . he drew in a ragged breath and her
[17/1000]	i pull back my hand and stare at him . he sits up and opens the door , leaving me standing on the porch . i do n't even need to say goodbye . he kisses the top of

[19/1000]	" i believe that 's the gist of it , " she assured him with a tight smile . " did you visit your mother very often ? " he asked . " yes . she was kind
[20/1000]	but then a new concern grabbed my attention . " where is he ? " i yelled to riley . " upstairs in your room if you want to take that , " he told me . he
[21/1000]	" he has an evil bone in his body . " " god , he 's so evil . " she took several swift breaths . " i need to sleep . " he shook his head
[22/1000]	he looked at them both and nodded for them to go on . " what 's the use in wasting your breath playing games , " nick said . " those guys are n't going to change once they

[30/1000]	" i did n't do anything ! " i said , my voice rising . she took three steps and was standing over me . " you think i do n't notice you watching it all the time ?
[31/1000]	he sighed and placed a hand on her knee . " what the hell is wrong with you about that ? " " you know what . just leave . " her stomach rolled and her body was instantly
[32/1000]	she was there ? how ? i went into my bedroom and opened my drawer . two neat stacks of paper lay there , like dolls ' dolls . " now i know what i 'm doing ,
[33/1000]	" you 've still got seven hours , " said a voice at the door . " come on in now . " " jesus christ . " max 's temper rose over instinct . " do you always

[51/1000]	" i did n't , " she said slowly . " he saved me . " there it was . that hesitation again . no , he did n't want her to confess . not to anyone .
[52/1000]	" like i would believe you , " i say honestly . he gives a grin and runs his knuckles along the underside of my chin . " not a chance . " and then he makes me

[55/1000]	" please , i did n't ... " i put my wrists up in surrender . " please do n't kill me . " " fine , fine , but no more begging ! " he snapped .
[56/1000]	" i guess . now , let 's hurry . the truck 's got to be back by tomorrow . let 's get moving . " they took off again . with two hours to kill , they tried
[57/1000]	" do you know what it is ? " i looked up at him . he was gazing down at me with a serious expression , and for a second i thought he might say yes . "
[58/1000]	i love how much you give to me . that is my heart and soul , <EOS> this love is yours my life is yours your honor is your gift , always to me . and it calls you
[59/1000]	" i saw you in the field and saw <EOS> and back when it does everything . " his voice had been so deep and sweet . i shuddered . this was so different . our kisses and being completely
[60/1000]	" i do n't think you do . " her brow furrowed . " you have to believe me . " " i want to be in front of my husband . even if in my imagination you are
[61/1000]	" no , i said no , " he said , still not looking at me , still listening . " i 'm sorry , " i said . " i 'm sorry . " he did n't
[62/1000]	" i am happy , " i sighed . " truly . " " i know you are , but we still know the truth . " she sighed and looked at me . " it is right that

[69/1000]	" yes . you already know about this ? " she pointed to the book i had been reading since i came out of the church . " yes , " i answered honestly . " i learned from
[70/1000]	" of course , " i say , a little surprised she thought that i would be so agreeable when such an idea had never occurred to me . i pull open the door slightly and then lean out on
[71/1000]	" you are so special , baby , " ben finally said . my eyes closed . " please ... " he lowered his hand down to my knee until his palm rested against the inside of my
[72/1000]	i say this to him , to take control of myself again . he smiles and pulls back before laying his head on my chest . i put my hand on his forehead and he rolls onto his side to
[73/1000]	a lot about the series are not written in english but in fact the translation of the books is similar and he has to do whatever he can to understand the writing and writing of these first two books .
[74/1000]	" how do you like your job teaching classes at the county fair ? " i turned to look at her , surprised . " i did n't know there was one during the yearly fair . "
[75/1000]	the man opened his eyes . the man stood up immediately and took hold of the young woman . when he realized she did n't move , he released her to stand back up . he pushed her hair away
[76/1000]	the door swung open , and a stranger entered . " i 'm sorry ... , " he began , but her mind was elsewhere . " i can move you , but i need to talk to
[77/1000]	" fine , " i said quietly . " they 'll wait . that 's bad luck . " " they both are . " " what if i were no better , sam ? " he
[78/1000]	" but i like her . i 'd like to think she likes me , too . i ca n't imagine that she does n't . " his mother smiled a little bit . " she 'll do all

[80/1000]	he saw that she , too , was watching him closely . " yes . " " that 's something . " he nodded . " can i ask you a question , mr. smith ? "
[81/1000]	i take a few deep breaths , and then go running for my car . after some research , i get a letter from john , who lets me know he 's come up with a plan . i wish
[82/1000]	" wait a minute . what did you just say ? " " when we first started dating i said you sounded like such an angel . i thought i 'd never see you again . " i
[83/1000]	i hear two sounds . one is a soft click echoing in my ears , like a hammer on a door , but i ca n't tell for sure from where : in the house . the other sounds are
[84/1000]	" do n't worry . he wo n't say anything incriminating . " " you keep that man locked up tight , " <EOS> " <EOS> ... " " did n't go to work for real now in
[85/1000]	" we 're still here , " he said , trying to act like he did n't care . " sure , we are . why do n't you come here and have a drink with me ? we
[86/1000]	" yeah . i am . i 'll show you . " without so much as a protest , he helped me climb down . <EOS> up , while he picked my feet , and we made our way
[87/1000]	she stared at him in confusion . he knew the expression well . the first time they 'd crossed paths , he 'd told her he did n't want her to go on like this . his eyes narrowed
[88/1000]	i 'm not sure it were really possible for either of us to breathe past the other . " i 'll be over tonight , " he breathed , his face inches from mine . " tell mom that
[89/1000]	" they 're not exactly a match . " " what the hell does that mean ? " " the first place they 'll try to look to is your father . " " look ? "
[90/1000]	" how do i get people to feel comfortable in your presence ? " " maybe it 's the fact that you 're a complete player , " melissa said cryptically . " or because i 'm the one
[91/1000]	" okay . <EOS> for the right way , " mike of course . " well , um , it looks nice " - there was a pause , " do you think it could be the same person
[92/1000]	" yes sir . and i have a big meeting after that . " but he 'd been working so much these last few days , he did n't understand how he could n't think about anything other than having
[93/1000]	she studied him a moment , her face full of disbelief . then , staring for the first time , she said , " that 's the only good thing . " chapter twenty - eight the next
[94/1000]	she shook her head . " i ca n't accept that . " but there was so much more to it than just that . " i 'd never have my trust fund if it meant changing you into some
[95/1000]	you 're the only man i can ever want in my life anymore , your lips are like roses , and a touch of mint is exactly what i need to keep me <EOS> i think you 'll have <EOS>
[96/1000]	" i am going to be around for a while , but you must promise to behave and behave like adults , " he was telling my mom . " is that understood ? " " yes !
[97/1000]	" of course not ! but if you ever do . " after her lecture , i waited until my father finally went home . i stopped by the hospital and helped my mom clean up her small bed
[98/1000]	not that it 's going to stop me , but i need to take care of my daughter . " i have an appointment i need to cancel . " mom lets out a squeal , jumping out
[99/1000]	" well i 'm happy you 'll be here anyway . i do n't think she 'll be home for another week when the baby comes . " mrs. browley then turned to hanna . " i just want you
[100/1000]	michael took the bag from him and started to load the bags into the car . " just so you know , i do n't want it . so no more hot chocolate and no more cuddling . "
[101/1000]	" you did n't know about the poison ivy , " cassie realized , even before he did : that what his body called the toxin ivy really did cure him . " no , i did n't ,
[102/1000]	he sat on the bar stool across from david . " you were sitting outside with mary margaret . " david nodded . " i asked if someone else wanted some . " " no , i was
[103/1000]	" no , " i said as i laid my hands in my lap . " she does n't . i have no idea what she is up to , but i do n't have time for ... " who
[104/1000]	he nodded , his face hard . " you may send your men over immediately on the sixth day , on december fifteenth . then we 'll march , cross , and cross . " he waved a hand

[109/1000]	" if it 's not a bad game , go with the flow . " " so you 're saying you had plenty of time and were on your way home early . the reason i came was for
[110/1000]	" i 'll have you know that i did n't have any kind of family life in philadelphia until a little over two years ago - " " what the hell did you ever do that was so terrible

[112/1000]	he 'd kissed her before ; she was sure of it . in fact it 'd been a little rough , but they were holding on with everything they had . " i have a million more of these ,
[113/1000]	he would n't take a chance that she might have been drugged and kidnapped by some wild animal . " are you going to hurt her ? " " i 'm not going to hurt her . "
[114/1000]	" very good , but you must pay your bill at the last second . " " but this is so incredible ! it 's absolutely wonderful . this hotel room is beyond the limits of the modern technology
[115/1000]	" it 's quite simple , " rose declared . " when mr. and mrs. la dd moved to london , they 'd chosen one of the largest properties available two towns away . they thought they would move here

[118/1000]	" his friend is already there , " she said . " he 's on his way to the hospital , " i said . " is it to bring him an update on the people injured in the
[119/1000]	" no , " he said , and his voice was barely audible . " come on in . " i stepped over into the living room , took off my shoes , and walked around the side of
[120/1000]	" if we have to choose , your little sister will , " she said . " and that 's a really good thing . i ca n't be around you if it 's not important to my father .
[121/1000]	i reached over and tousled the waves of his head . " you 're like a father to me when i 'm not a teenager . i ca n't express one word of what you 're doing to me because
[122/1000]	" and if you had n't said what you said , my son would be alive right now . " " and if i had n't said it ... ? " " i do n't want you making
[123/1000]	" they will wait , " elizabeth said crisply . " fine . " " you can be ruthless , of course . " " what 's that supposed to mean ? " she eyed him
[124/1000]	i looked at luke with a smile . i had put on a little makeup to make my face look even more sexy . i also took off the earrings i told luke i would wear because i really did
[125/1000]	" so you think that i know all the real meaning of love ? ' i asked her , trying to take off my glove . " yes , " she said softly . " are you feeling okay
[126/1000]	" yeah , then what ? you can tell me now , " said james . " the night before you left , you said you went to italy and met him , did n't you ? " "
[127/1000]	" i would n't have survived those two hours down at the hospital , " she said . " i 'm going to be busy in these next few weeks . i 'll have to send someone to help make
[128/1000]	his voice was low , but it was clear enough . " i did n't expect you to . " and he left it at that . maybe i would n't , either . if he was
[129/1000]	for a second she had the urge to call him . then she realized , it was n't necessary . she had everything she needed now , and if jack heard anything more on the news , he 'd be

[134/1000]	the guard lifted his head sharply . he opened his mouth -- not in a silent " o " but in the " o " of a scream . one of the soldiers held his elbow . "
[135/1000]	" please . it <EOS> do n't like that , i might like to get tired . " i remembered the people having to endure <EOS> , the way we knew getting on the village , and i figured
[136/1000]	" who ? " she asked as she held her hat against her chest and glanced at me . i laughed and then she stepped up and kissed me goodnight . i wrapped a hand around the back
[137/1000]	" i 'm sorry . you 're right . it was nothing . but it has to be resolved soon . " her eyes grew worried . " it has to be . " i understood how she felt
[138/1000]	" i do not feel all that well , " my grandfather said . " if something are wrong ... " " our lord will send a word . " " it is the same message he
[139/1000]	" will you take a nice long walk tomorrow ? " " sure . " she turned and walked to my bedroom . " stop . i said stop . get ready for bed . " "
[140/1000]	a man 's voice spoke . ' captain , perhaps we should have come ahead with our tour of duty ? ' beesely raised his head to find another man approaching , a uniform hanging on his arm
[141/1000]	" what did you think i was ? " " i believed you would have an answer to my question . " " i believed you 'd be willing to talk about it . what else would've you
[142/1000]	" that 's because you need a fix . you 're taking advantage of the need . i 'll give you one . " " really ? what does that mean ? " he asked . " it
[143/1000]	" i guess he sent you tonight , with the intention of having you ... " " his ... ? " i asked , slowly turning to my parents . " yes . " elizabeth sounded a little
[144/1000]	" where are the children ? " asked the doctor . the black - haired woman stared at him for a moment in silence . " they are all well . the doctor has decided to take them to

[148/1000]	' not quite everyone , ' he said dryly . ' just a group of them were looking for their money . ' ' they came to collect . ' ' they did , ' he said ,
[149/1000]	i 'm already shaking . i hear a sob from her . " everything okay , love ? " i ask sincerely , hoping there was some way she could tell me how sorry she was that mom
[150/1000]	a tall man in a fine silk dress suit exited . " mr. ha ffe y , my lady . " he bowed deep , showing a rather long row of polished white teeth . " who are you
[151/1000]	" you said he 'd be out by now . " i shook my head . " no , but the police are checking his room . they have to realize he 's not in here at all .
[152/1000]	it was a sad sight . the boy , as she had never seen , was watching her with longing and horror . he had never spoken to her before . ' i 'm sorry he did n't
[153/1000]	" no , " he said , with a laugh , glancing around , eyeing the faces on the walls . " but i 'll tell you about the story eventually . " he drew me down between two
[154/1000]	" no , " he says , looking right at me . he 's talking about the woman on the edge of death . " it 's the woman who lives . " he 's talking about the woman who
[155/1000]	her mouth curled . " maybe . " he was so intrigued by her wit that he felt like she 'd just sucker punched him in the gut . " that 's too ... sweet . " "
[156/1000]	" he 's there all right . if he was n't , he would be . " " well i 'm here . you ca n't keep me from killing my best friend . " " be
[157/1000]	" the only way you 'll get the job is if you stay with me , girl . " " do n't even joke about that . " i snapped . " i was n't , you were
[158/1000]	and then , just as clearly as if they were real , one of them said to me , " do you want to dance ? " <EOS> ... and just as abruptly as the woman by his daughter at
[159/1000]	" ' let that be enough , ' " intoned the elder . " not when you possess ... " the elder gestured to his chest . " what he holds . " tavi gasped . " what ?
[160/1000]	" hi . " i smiled at him . " it 's not nice , huh ? " " yeah , it sucks . but for now , we should get along really well . " braydon scooted closer
[161/1000]	" oh what am i getting myself into ? " said mary jane . " i hate spiders . " jane jane 's eyes widened at this . mary jane said , " i do n't do spiders
[162/1000]	" what does that have to do with anything ? i could n't get him to leave . he could n't - " " yes , yes you could . " " no i could n't . "
[163/1000]	james stopped chewing , closed his eyes , and swallowed . " what if i do n't want to live without her ? " " what are you talking about ? " " this place ... " he
[164/1000]	" you love me , " i said softly . " more . " he exhaled the words . " more than anything we both can ever want . more than anything . " i was silent as
[165/1000]	" do n't let me get in trouble . " " you wo n't be . " before she could continue , he stopped . " if you 're looking for you or the kids , see you
[166/1000]	" did something happen ? " kelly asked . " nothing on my list , but it 's still going to be harder to make sense of this later . " " can i come in ? "
[167/1000]	" what ? " i gasp . he holds up a finger . " let us finish , please . " " no . just tell me - " " you will be mine . " if
[168/1000]	" i do n't think that 's the case , " she said . " what do you mean ? " i asked . " if the girl at the market was really as great as you say
[169/1000]	" actually i 'm working on something that will help . " she held out the black business card i 'd given her . " what is it ? " " it 's a gift from our firm
[170/1000]	i opened my mouth to protest . before i could let her finish , she interrupted . " i 'm sorry of your loss . i know i 've been an emotional - " " i think it
[171/1000]	' hello , ' said the same voice . ' she 's in the nursery with two of her mates so i suggest you hurry . then the little girl will make an appearance , which is something we 'll
[172/1000]	i leaned against the wall , letting my head land against it . i closed my eyes . i needed to breathe in . i needed to not just cry , but to mourn the loss of this amazing woman
[173/1000]	" you seem to have a knack for this sort of thing , " sephrenia observed . " it ca n't be helped , " aphrael replied lightly . " a man can only make such complex calculations when
[174/1000]	" i got out of him ! " the boy burst out , eyes wide . " you did ? " " yeah , i did , i threw him on the ground , " he said ,
[175/1000]	" i 'm sorry ? " " that about my mom , " he said . " no , " she said . " no , do n't be . she would n't want you to have a
[176/1000]	but when he looked up again , she was gone . he started thinking that maybe she 'd gone to her room . so he walked back outside and started searching for her . she was n't in the
[177/1000]	she smiled , feeling absurdly pleased with herself . it was a big relief to know they 'd gotten a few things straight . but she was determined to push their relationship forward . what was worse , she was
[178/1000]	" no , " he told her . " your body is my body . you are mine to give and i have given , so do not try to deny that fact , angel . " she pushed
[179/1000]	it was the easiest way to enter . a few people at all times glanced up from their stations , and when they did , they greeted a familiar face . one of them was a pretty young girl who
[180/1000]	" oh , no , " i said . " no more . there 's no excuse i ca n't make . " he sighed with frustration . " you 're being an idiot . we ca n't do
[181/1000]	" i just have on black . can you see me all there , black ? i never get in . " " do n't worry , you have already . you 'll get in just fine , "
[182/1000]	" are you going to do this , alex ? " " yes . " i nodded . " i love you , alex , so very much . " he smiled at me and nodded .
[183/1000]	the only way out of the office was to slip down the stairs . or else the whole thing would look like an incident of the new york subway . he had left that plan un developed . he
[184/1000]	she made a face , muttering , " i 'll be back , " as she disappeared into the kitchen . and i did n't have a choice . i had to stand there and keep her from leaving
[185/1000]	" yes . have you had any strange visions ? " david asked . " only odd images , " he hedged . i swallowed hard . " did you see something i saw ? " "
[186/1000]	" yes . " " are you getting married , " i asked . " no . it 's a first . " " why did you not call ? i thought you were going to the
[187/1000]	he looked up at her , blinking in surprise . " yeah . well , it 's good to see you . i 'm not afraid of you , not anymore . " " oh , really ? i
[188/1000]	then i 'd call you . but you went directly to the office and told someone about you and your dad . i 'm guessing it was her , because i saw her get your dad 's car two days
[189/1000]	the next day , i returned , exhausted . a sharp pain shot through my ribs , but i ignored it . if my dad had been up , would n't he have called to see if something was wrong
[190/1000]	" they are , " we told him grimly . " they 'll try to destroy themselves , after they learn to control them . they 'll destroy us in the meantime . " he smiled at us ,
[191/1000]	' i 'm going to need more than that if we do n't catch that man . ' ' nothing is going to stop me from getting what i want , ' kalten growled . ' it 's
[192/1000]	' we 're talking about twenty and forty years , ' said susan , with a shrug . ' not necessarily , ' said susan . ' and that would be me - you could have just met me
[193/1000]	" why are you doing this ? " " helping my mom make me a new wardrobe . this one is for the girls , since i want to wear my favorite jeans and a black t - shirt
[194/1000]	" only if you 're the first to ask , " she giggled . " what 's going on , are you two ready to go to dinner ? " i asked her . " we ca n't leave
[195/1000]	no , your majesty . where are you ? i see . i need someone to come fetch me while i 'm gone . i ca n't do this . he 'll let you do it
[196/1000]	" was he telling the truth ? " " yes . " " did he kill your daughter ? " " yes . but you 'd expect a child on the run from you . i suspected
[197/1000]	" how did you get down ? can you get us out of here ? " sean asked . " there 's nothing you ca n't do to escape when that trap gets sprung , sean . the next
[198/1000]	" what kind of bad guys are we facing ? " i ask as i make sure i keep a firm grip on the strap . " there is no one . i am the only one watching .
[199/1000]	<EOS> in the other room , the tv was on the same channel that it always had been . the muted smell of old furniture and coffee wafted around the room . still feeling somewhat guilty about his morning quickie
[200/1000]	he looked down for a moment at his hands then pushed the hair from her face . " i have the power to make you lose control . " " i ca n't lose control . this ... this
[201/1000]	she looked at her watch . it was almost midnight . she still had a long while to go . " ok ? " james asked softly . " you ok ? " " yes . thanks for
[202/1000]	" i would rather die than stay , " she murmured through a choked sob , curling herself protectively against his chest . a smile tugged at his lips , one that warned the mere sound of her distress
[203/1000]	" i have an idea ! " he said excitedly . " i have a great idea ! that 's what i should be talking about with you , girl - no more questions . " " what idea
[204/1000]	it 's not the way i 'd expected a date to go , but i 'm not ashamed of how i 've handled it either . maybe it 's not entirely our fault that i 've gotten myself tangled up
[205/1000]	" i can get you to do it , " she said again . instead of answering her , he leaned over with two arms and brought her hard against his chest . she moaned at the contact .
[206/1000]	" what are you going to do ? " i asked when he released my leg to set it down . he turned me on my back so i was lying facedown on the couch . " i 'm
[207/1000]	" he is in the third of march . the second is in the first , and the first is in the beginning . he is on the seventh and at the fifth of a thousand years , he will
[208/1000]	" my , my , my , " he says , letting her slide down his body , her hands brushing over his taut abs . " i did n't think you were going to be this responsive . you
[209/1000]	i swallowed , but i was suddenly sure there was no way she even knew i was alive . * * * when i woke up , everything felt different . except for the ache under my eye
[210/1000]	" it 's just that , " i replied . " i did n't think i needed that much to get started . " he gave me a very un cute frown , the sort of look that says
[211/1000]	" i do n't wish to be ... " i faltered , feeling embarrassed that i had n't said anything else . " let 's just say you 're an observant man , and i like to avoid those who
[212/1000]	his parents . the memories of the past night were too much to keep locked away . once again , this was not what he wanted . had a life been so simple ? so comfortable ? he 'd done
[213/1000]	she shook her head . ' is there a problem ? ' he asked slowly , ' that you would rather i simply go away ? ' ' no . is that it ? ' ' i
[214/1000]	she stared at him , still panting , unable to think . " but that does n't mean it does n't exist . because that does n't give me any guilt . i 'm just saying that ... "
[215/1000]	he could take her on horseback anyway but he 'd prefer riding beside her as some kind of comfort . when he did n't answer , she got up again and padded over to the opposite wall . she
[216/1000]	he had n't noticed before , but by the time he got back to his house , she was alone . after a quick shower and change into clean clothes , he drove into town and parked in front
[217/1000]	" what are you doing ? " she let out a long breath . " no matter what goes down , remember this . the guy wants to destroy your mind . i do n't know how , but
[218/1000]	" i 'm going to get off at nine , okay ? " i told them . " i want to stay , " my dad said . " you can , " max told him .
[219/1000]	she shrugged . " that 's what you tell everyone . " " you know i have to go ? " i asked . " i 'm really early this morning . " " it 's not early
[220/1000]	" that 's what i 'm thinking . " i was n't sure what to say , so i tried to find the right thing to say and said , " i can tell you i 'd be a terrible
[221/1000]	you are the wind , i thought , and there will be no more magic . " i 'm sorry , " she said , and i saw her tear - soaked face , her voice rising to an
[222/1000]	" you know what i mean . " " i want to hear you say it out loud . " he pulled into a spot back in the long line and parked his motorcycle . " i 'll
[223/1000]	but they were too deep to leave easily enough to begin with . he 'd been right about the tree not being quite the same height , but it was still there , still in the way . the
[224/1000]	" you 'd better come eat , " i say , hoping she 'll be gone soon . i 've hardly eaten since i left the hotel , and the food being here can be pretty good , especially in
[225/1000]	" you mean , a little person ? " his eyes squinted . " not me , though i 'd love to be . after all , is n't that what i 've always wanted ? someone who 's a
[226/1000]	it did n't take much thinking to pick up the gist of what she was saying <EOS> right , and all so much for the small - and the occasional ' things . i wished i was n't going on
[227/1000]	he shrugged . " i just wanted to see it . " he paused . " i love it here . " i laughed and pushed his shoulder . " do n't be too sure of that . the
[228/1000]	she snorted . " i 'm not going to change . " " you are going to change , and i intend to see that you feel the same . " she froze for a moment . could
[229/1000]	" sorry , " she mumbled , but it was a wasted apology . " i do n't want to hear about it tonight . " she walked away , leaving gabriel alone with her father to plan a
[230/1000]	" the people you 're telling me about now were people who were ... " i trailed off softly , wondering how much people could know of what we were doing . would they like it when our little secret
[231/1000]	" how do you know that ? " she blurted out , unable to hide her shock . " because i checked myself in a mirror on the way back . " even though the thought was frightening
[232/1000]	i knew from firsthand experience that the most dangerous place to visit on a normal day was the home <EOS> as a tree - the way one in the garden at the top of the stable - the secret of
[233/1000]	it was so true . what it was like to be alive . and as much as this whole thing had altered him , he had to admit he 'd come to enjoy it . the man had no clue
[234/1000]	" hey , " she said . " yeah , " he said , not to her but to the crowd . so he went to the bathroom , feeling worse about that than ever before .
[235/1000]	" not much . a little more than we had in this neighborhood . " " do you have the money to get back to your place ? " " probably . " " how far do
[236/1000]	" she does n't go to class until her day 's and i 'd bet my ass she does n't have any homework for the night . " i was now paying greater attention as we strode towards the
[237/1000]	but i did n't say anything . " you 're the one , " i finally said <EOS> ... " i wo n't play my way through , " his voice was soft , and we shared the same
[238/1000]	" well , is n't that a surprise ? " mr. mc cut chen asked as he gathered his hat and bag . " it would be all too easy to find yourself on loan to the likes of you
[239/1000]	" what 's the matter ? " she asked . " they have a new model of us . " " what kind of a model ? " " it 's a small one , not even
[240/1000]	" in other words , nobody ever comes to this planet . nobody ever gets a good look at the planet we 're on ? " " some people , maybe , i understand . some things you just
[241/1000]	chapter thirty - four " hey guys , " she said , shaking her head like she was having a hard time hearing us . " let me guess , this one is my last , and i 'm
[242/1000]	the room was dark and cold . she shivered at the ice chilling her skin . an orange emergency light lit the room , burning a soft yellow across the top of the cabinet . she 'd worn wool pea
[243/1000]	it was a good thing , too . i was worried he 'd try to take his own life . there was too much danger of going too far and getting killed by someone on the council . but i
[244/1000]	" oh , for christ 's sake . and you do n't even do sex . " " i do , " he says , then grins , proud of himself . " i just do n't know how
[245/1000]	" how about we break for a coffee ? " on cue , the jukebox exploded to life , rolling on the floor , followed by a series of " what goes around comes around " and " i
[246/1000]	" that 's why you need me to save you , and now the queen . " " i think so , " she said , nodding . " sholto , have you seen my uncle , as
[247/1000]	" we 'll get to that , " mark said . " if we 're lucky . there must be something there , something that can tell us what this thing is that saved you . but - " he
[248/1000]	the demon 's reptilian face twitched and he jerked his head as though trying to shake off the unseen weight . but he did n't , could n't budge it . no doubt he was unable to understand why he
[249/1000]	" sorry , i forget and that 's about it , " he said , raising his eyebrows . she grinned . " do you ever work on them ? you know , in general ? " he
[250/1000]	" i 'm fine ! " i said , unable to stop trying to smile . he walked forward , his pace slow but purposeful . " you look tired . " i tried to catch my breath
[251/1000]	" thanks . " he looks annoyed . " i 'm sorry . i 've really got to get back to work now . " i give him a quick wave and walk down the few steps to the
[252/1000]	" it 's okay . i have no doubt that it will be okay . the thing is , i just had someone come over last night and ask some questions . i did n't want him to see the
[253/1000]	" go . " i nod and rush out of the room , closing the door behind me . i sink down onto the front steps , my knees feeling like gravel as i watch the city disappear
[254/1000]	why would he ? " i made a mistake . i know that now , but i promise i wo n't do it again . and i wo n't try to take you into the house and force you into
[255/1000]	her other hand went to the hair at the nape of his neck and pulled him as close as they could get . she pulled . he pulled . one of them fell down and slid against her knees .
[256/1000]	" what a gentleman . you really should like him more . " " i do n't know . " he smiled at her and put his hands on her shoulders . " we both make mistakes here
[257/1000]	i watched her as she drank back her drink . it seemed she had been drinking for two years . " i do n't know where the hell you get all this magic , " she said , blinking at
[258/1000]	" i feel responsible for your mother 's death as well . you 're older now , " he pointed out . she 'd never considered the possibility of losing her mother during her growing school years . her
[259/1000]	" but you do n't have to . you could go back with me . " " i 'd rather not and my boyfriend would kill me . " after last night we 'd all had a bad
[260/1000]	" come on , " she said . " let 's finish up . " she felt the car coming full circle , the headlights illuminating the gravel road and turning onto the dusty road . and then , above
[261/1000]	you 'd think , in this family , our wife would've been able to tell when someone was lying , but no - she was quiet and composed . " no , " helen said with a slight shake
[262/1000]	" i got that , " he says , and i tell him that it 's all good . then we 're gone before anyone even thinks of turning on any lights . 10 the other day i
[263/1000]	' the rest of your friends never say their prayers or anything . i can help convince them , but you have to have lots of talent . ' tony shook his head . ' i do n't understand
[264/1000]	the woman nodded . " right a minute . " she picked up a small package and handed it to me . " this is for you . " i opened it and looked inside . it was a
[265/1000]	" no , " i sighed . the room went silent , and i breathed in the warm summer smell of the open flower beds and the warm night breeze that caressed my skin . " no , " i
[266/1000]	with a laugh , she closed the door . for once , i heard a woman 's voice coming from the dark . i glanced down at my watch and realized it was n't showing any time . i
[267/1000]	he reached under the table and opened the glove box . one of his knives was there , too . he wanted to take care of her . if only he had a place to stop . his
[268/1000]	" me at least . " " do n't argue with me , mr. walker . make your decision . " " i do n't know , " i said . " did you bring a pen
[269/1000]	" right . this ca n't be fun . " the little voice in the back of my head did n't like this . it wanted to die a very long time ago . something was n't right .
[270/1000]	" what the hell do you mean , ' it 's a coincidence ' ? " " i 'll bet you a little bit of money there 's money involved . " jake felt his stomach turn . this
[271/1000]	he paused , a hand on his chest , he breathed , " what are you doing here ? i thought you were back in new york . " i stopped , too . i needed to push forward
[272/1000]	" i guess so . " " well , we leave later , after everyone has gone . " " okay . " her dad 's eyes narrowed at me . " are you okay ? "
[273/1000]	as if he felt that she needed something on her face she rubbed down her face and straightened her green gown . she took the book from her sleeve , opened it to the second page as if to remove
[274/1000]	not until you put out the lights and took their clothes with you . she leaned against the cool tiles of the shower floor and sank down to her fingers , just needing the comfort of the contact .
[275/1000]	their first priority was their children ; and that meant they were prepared to be prepared to use force . rachel and her mother were a couple of years older and had n't even learned to fly yet today ,
[276/1000]	i was never good at thinking like a teacher . a teacher . i wanted to be good at just a lot of things , but all there was to do was look at things and hope you had the
[277/1000]	i 've only ever been back home once . i 'm afraid if i look past the memories and see there is enough of mine in this place , i might not believe her . i do n't even
[278/1000]	' well , i think she thought she was being polite . she is my best friend <EOS> and other things in any type of a real thing . what a real job we play , ' and that -
[279/1000]	it took a lot to shock this woman - to truly have her in his life . in his bed , he might want to hear her come - her moans of surrender , her cries of arousal with an
[280/1000]	" at your office ? " i say . " i want to make sure i know all the details on my client . " " okay ... uh , i 'll go , " i tell josh
[281/1000]	this is it , is n't it ? is this it , like all the other times the big stars went on as before ? a new version of the new system is coming out of hyperspace and it appears
[282/1000]	he looked at her then and he was right . he looked relieved . he also looked relieved to be free . she glanced at the three kids still standing by the chair , they 'd taken off
[283/1000]	" yeah . i do not like it here , " i tell him . " you do n't like it here ? " i push against his shoulders . " no . " " i get
[284/1000]	one time , we were in our bathroom at work and i had to take off the apron so i could drop it and walk to the sink . my mouth went dry . he was already there as if
[285/1000]	her eyes opened wide , and she froze . she clutched at my hand , looking panicked . " no worries , i wo n't fall , " i assured her , not taking a step . "
[286/1000]	" i knew what would happen , " he said softly , before he opened the door , leaving her thinking how great he 'd felt when he walked in . " when will the tests pick up ? "
[287/1000]	he grinned and said , " i can tell by the way you look in your dress that you appreciate what i can do for you . " " yes , i do . " " good .
[288/1000]	" good enough to eat <EOS> not so good to drink . " zane shook his head as he opened ty and pulled him closer . " what about you , zane ? " he asked ty , one hand
[289/1000]	" yes , daddy . " julia 's hand was trembling as she reached toward the switch for the television remote . the kitchen light blinked down , and she realized with a slight cringe that it was
[290/1000]	there was a very good reason for his silence , a reasonable , even reasonable reason . the fact was he did n't want to know . " did you love her ? " she asked .
[291/1000]	" it does n't have to be what you think it is , " he said , and his smile widened . " you do n't care for me as a person , and i should be grateful for that
[292/1000]	" i - no , " i almost choked them out . " then why do you have to cry now ? " dad knelt beside me and wiped my cheeks . i looked up in a panic
[293/1000]	" yes , i know , but i need to know what 's involved , is everything ok ? " she asked . " yes , of course , " said the minister , " and just what did
[294/1000]	" you mean she was ... alive for a day after ? " i nodded . " yeah . " " if she had n't , she certainly would be dead now . we did n't have that
[295/1000]	and then i had seen the woman . standing by the end of the long , narrow corridor on which we sat . the dark shape was the tall , stately woman i had seen as a child of old
[296/1000]	" i 'll go with you in this . " her voice was not reassuring . i could n't find the words . i sat down on a large wooden crate and pulled myself up as if i had n't
[297/1000]	with that , he turned to her and gave her a big thumbs - up . " well , ladies , i think your dinner is ready . " he turned and made it to the table before taking
[298/1000]	" why are you all covered in leaves ? " said peter , sounding slightly more excited . " who is this ' new bird ' who has gotten under my skin ? " asked bodo . i
[299/1000]	" you 're a liar , " he whispered . his arms were wrapped around her waist , holding her loosely , and her back to his front . " you think you 're so damn great and mighty and
[300/1000]	" you went to one of his old meetings ? " " yes . " he hesitated , then added , " yes , i did . " " you 're lying . you 're in trouble .
[301/1000]	a few moments later the lights were switched on , and a band of thirty or so men in dark suits gathered in a corner , close by several women they had n't seen earlier . one of them was
[302/1000]	" no idea what to say , " his grandmother said , her expression apologetic . " oh , my . all right , have fun . " " yes , ma'am . " mike shrugged , then waved
[303/1000]	" my parents do n't approve . and they made it very clear many times that if i do n't have any business with grayson and me , i 'll be a dead man . " " maybe they
[304/1000]	mike shrugged as she led them to the stairs that led to his apartment . " could you let this dog be a friend to you and i can stop by the other night ? " samantha asked .
[305/1000]	i could n't sleep with him . i had n't felt this way for him since the day we hung out in my gym and saw each other again , and there was nothing like it . <EOS> ...
[306/1000]	" we ca n't leave so early . " " yeah . but we never really took the time to get ready for this party . " " what party ? " " we have a special
[307/1000]	what do i want to do ? i pull myself together and grab my car keys . there 's no time to call my mom . she should n't have to deal with a baby on top of everything
[308/1000]	" she 's more than welcome . " he did n't back away , only leaned a little closer , his forearm a breath from her face . " why do n't you let me show you . it 's
[309/1000]	" you do not have to be mad at him , that is all . he did n't make his accusations . he 's just a businessman after all . " she tried once again to convince me not to
[310/1000]	and i 'd had to shoot him . had i known about the others ' ability to fight , i really would have called the police and asked if he could be healed . but after the blood - death
[311/1000]	" oh . i see , " said roger carefully , " i 'll just be making myself a bit more comfortable , then . are ye sure you would n't like to sit down a moment or something ?
[312/1000]	" i do n't see why not . but we both know it 's not going to happen . i know it like i know my own self . " he straightened up his shoulders , " alright , let
[313/1000]	" and who 's going to be right in the middle ? " she 's been busy and i 've been slow , always . " you 're next . " " i 'll make it quick .
[314/1000]	he watched warily as she started walking , then followed , following her . he watched her up the stairwell , then sat down on her staircase , his hands tucked behind his head . gabby stopped in her
[315/1000]	" i know , " he said as they stepped outside . both of them looked at where her home rested . " does that mean you come here often ? " he asked . " most
[316/1000]	the girl was silent for a while before moving toward him . " is that what you 're doing , buddy ? " he stepped into her path . the hand to his chest slipped to his shoulder and
[317/1000]	" let 's go . " the next morning was a mad house . a knock on the door interrupted all the commotion . " we 're being summoned to the dean 's office . if you will
[318/1000]	if there was one person who could fix me , it was him . he was the only one who could make it go away . i did n't know why , but the only thing that mattered was
[319/1000]	" no problem , " mike said . he paused . " do you want me to tell you the story of the game ? " jack wanted to hear about the fight he 'd had with matt ,
[320/1000]	' who are you ? you 're - you 're the most dangerous man i know . ' ' not for money , ' canfield answered . ' for your personal gain . ' ' i beg your
[321/1000]	while jon continues to try on his clothes then comes back outside , we hear and hear more commotion in the street outside . when jon returns , he asks , " what direction did you say to go tonight
[322/1000]	" i would n't let you run around with the crazy ones . " he put an arm around my waist and pulled me close . " what are you dressed up for ? " " i 'm going
[323/1000]	a grin split his lips to show his dimples again , but they disappeared before she could catch sight of them . " you 're really hot yourself , " he murmured as he started to kiss the trail
[324/1000]	" like hell . i want to know everything about you right now . you owe me a secret that i 'm not about to share . in fact , then i 'll trust you . " " i
[325/1000]	" well , you wanted a decent place to get the key . in the center of town . " " and you thought this was a good time to get it ? " " oh , a
[326/1000]	but he could n't . it was a long , long time before he could tell her . chapter 5 he watched over her , the tension in his arms , his large body , the warmth of
[327/1000]	i do n't know what for . " i 've made my decision about this place , and now i want you out of my house . " he rolls his eyes . " you 're an ass *
[328/1000]	i had come to feel that way from the moment i woke up from the rape . it was one of the most intense sexual experiences of my life , but the second time in my life , i was
[329/1000]	" thank you , " she said hesitantly . " you 're welcome , " he said , looking up at her with that intense gaze . " are you sure you like it ? " she nodded
[330/1000]	" now that you mention it , it seems he did mention that he thought some of the guys wanted to visit their old place during the summer . did he ever say why it would be too hard for
[331/1000]	this time when you saw him when he went away , was not that cold ? " " exactly ! " * * * another day 's work on the hotel 's computers gave the best results
[332/1000]	" what happened to you ? " " well , there was a major fall . i hit the pavement and broke two bones to break them . my mom could n't forgive me for it , so she
[333/1000]	" and i do n't blame you , i 've been getting a lot of that out of my cell phone . thanks . " " if you do n't mind , i think maybe we should make a
[334/1000]	" i ca n't look like i 'm here . " " why not ? " the words were wrenched from her in a raw whisper . he turned , his eyes sharp as he studied her from
[335/1000]	the doctor and nurse were standing at one end of the room , not touching each other . each stared at the other and would n't leave the room or speak to each other . in a place of solitude
[336/1000]	but he was about to leave the room , to let her sleep . " you 're welcome . " on instinct , she reached out , caught his arm mid - swing . " i 'd rather not
[337/1000]	" it does not matter . you could just do it on your own , you know . " " we can . " " no . " her eyes met mine , and the hurt they held
[338/1000]	" no , honey . i just thought it was a fine thing until your mother asked if i had heard of a woman who was missing . " " missing ? what do you mean missing ? "
[339/1000]	" do n't you dare ! " she yelled back with the fierceness of an angry child . " i 've brought you back to life just as much as you ever could ! " she knew she needed
[340/1000]	i 'm not sure what to expect , but it had to have been someone from the group of three men i 'd hired to replace me that night at the brothel . i do n't think he meant for
[341/1000]	nick got up to join her , kissed her cheek . " you 're welcome . " " i was almost ready , too . " he cupped her face and rubbed his nose against hers . "
[342/1000]	" i 've never met a guy who was n't an ass * * le to me , " she says . " one thing i learned in high school and one thing i 'll never forget . "
[343/1000]	" i am no longer with you ? " she shook her head . " no . i have had many other women . you . " she looked beyond him . " your mother was right . i
[344/1000]	' good . ' ' shall i ask miss callie ? she used to make a mean pie . i still miss it . ' ' yes . ' he was watching her , still dressed casually in
[345/1000]	" let 's see . " she sighed . " i swear i 'm not going to lie and say i have no idea how to drive , but if i had some good news , i think i 'd
[346/1000]	" oh , no , " i said as i ran out the door and down the hall . " well , good night then . " hunter smiled . i hung up the phone . " it
[347/1000]	" he 's going to pay for this ! " it came out more of a growl than a plea . " you do n't want him to pay for anything , " she said evenly . "
[348/1000]	" it 's okay , " she said , " it 's okay . he came now . " this time , he was inside her - his c * ck hard and long , and hot air
[349/1000]	" yes . that is why you will be in our home . this is a place where the only things we do here are our lives . if you want to stay a servant , please do not leave
[350/1000]	" i found a small box of matches inside . " she smiled as she handed the box to him . he quickly lit the match and the box disappeared , leaving him with a smoldering box of matches and
[351/1000]	" i know right now , how bad is it ? " " very bad , " he said again . he saw jack coming back into the room , and got up . " do n't leave
[352/1000]	" is that what happened to harry ? " asked jen , surprised . " yes , but you 've been asked not all will be well . not all will be well , " harry started in ,
[353/1000]	" i know this will be hard for you , " adam said , looking worried . " but it 's a war we have never won . " " yes it is . " " so it
[354/1000]	" you need to quit being so tough are n't you ? " " you 're the one who 's tough . " " maybe this might help . " " oh , no . you 're
[355/1000]	" my name is james , " he said . he looked no younger than my own age , and if anything , he was much thinner . " we have a debt to pay . " " one
[356/1000]	i turn back around to make my way back to the front of the deck . no the big oaf . not there . my throat is dry and my heart is thudding . i pass a set of
[357/1000]	i give him a worried look and sit gingerly , like i 'm ready to float all over the place . it 's one of those weird situations where you look like you 're about to faint . "
[358/1000]	" my lord . " " i was n't sure whether to be flattered or disappointed . " " you ? " " i 'm as surprised as you are . " they walked for a
[359/1000]	they were back to that place . he could feel it taking over his body . his legs gave out and he lay against the rock bed against his will again . he was in a daze . then was
[360/1000]	" you do ? " i asked . he nodded even more vigorously . " then you remember well how we kissed . " " yes . " he said , and he knew that . he
[361/1000]	" hey , man , " lucas said as he turned to face the newcomer . i watched mason cross his arms and give me a hard look . " i ca n't believe you , lucas . mason
[362/1000]	' what do you mean ? ' ' i mean , they wo n't be coming up here . there are the usual problems being put up there , there are the guests . and you never know .
[363/1000]	" i get it . " " your mom was a strong woman . " " yeah , she was , but being part of her family , she 's a wreck now . " he had a
[364/1000]	then he did it again and again and again and again until tears were running down her face and her head hit the rail , her body trembling spas mo dically , her lungs fighting for breath . "
[365/1000]	" okay , " she said , " so why her ? " " i do n't know . i may know , but i did n't see the connection . " ethan moved a little closer . "
[366/1000]	in return , the man did not release richard hand . although one side of the room still offered a view to richard 's window , it was now blocked by two similarly - looking guard towers . the man
[367/1000]	i watched as a blond woman , short , heavy - set , wore a faded dark sweater and pants . her bare feet clacked along the floor behind her as she walked . her lips were pinched , and
[368/1000]	" i understand . " " i 've known you since the day i saw you standing in that coffee shop . you were easy to walk with . " he cocked a brow . " so i
[369/1000]	" and do you know what 's better than the last ? " he asked , then added as he closed the distance between them , " we know . " the comment confused her more than anything else
[370/1000]	" i 'm gon na walk you to the door . " i sat and watched him walk away . " okay . " he reached the door then stopped . i sat up to my feet .
[371/1000]	" is he dead ? " " he 's gone . from now on , anything you need to know is directly asked . i suppose there 's no sense in telling you that again , " he sighed
[372/1000]	" the boy 's a hard work but not at the expense of another man 's life . i ca n't imagine why the new one , the young one , would decide to go home to his parents and
[373/1000]	2 it starts 2 maybe 2 oh 2 someone 2 then 2 what 2 though 2 it 's 2 thing 2 do n't 2 i 've 2 the
[374/1000]	" i need a coffee . " i said through the door . it was after midnight and i still could n't sleep , but it was my body that was screaming away at me . i looked down at
[375/1000]	" i can just see you sleeping in those old overalls of yours , " she said wistfully . " what a fine day , eh , will henry ? where did you learn to drive an old beater like
[376/1000]	" yeah , we were just taking it in . " he grabbed my hand with a big grin . " my mom has n't been all that crazy about me dating a stripper since i was in diapers
[377/1000]	" now , wait just a goddamn minute , i 'm not telling anyone anything . i 'm just telling you what i knew because i think you need to hear it . " i closed my eyes .
[378/1000]	i watched the trees below , the dark form of an animal that seemed much larger than a man . my pulse quickened and my palms started to sweat , making me feel strangely claustrophobic inside the truck .
[379/1000]	i took a deep breath and let it out slowly . " you would have been okay with that , but no , i do n't want to marry this man . " i walked over to jack and
[380/1000]	" what do you mean by a kiss is a kiss is a kiss ? that 's what i thought , maybe you have a point ? " she asked . " but what if i had a bite mark
[381/1000]	" if you can keep yourself in a bubble a minute longer while i feed you , " she said , and i stifled an audible gasp . maybe she did need to change sometime , and then give herself
[382/1000]	" well , that 's it . " " that 's it ? " " no . <EOS> , yes , and you wo n't be talking - " they came and it was fun . " we
[383/1000]	he raised a brow . " or what ? " " i want this to be real , adam . this time , in the bedroom . " " yeah , i get that , " he told
[384/1000]	" who ? what the hell 's going on ? " " we 're back , and i do n't know . " " the kids at the hospital ? " " what about them ? "
[385/1000]	" so why 've you been bothering me ? you probably took the order from her because she told you to . " " no . i 've walked into a woman 's life and tried to play at
[386/1000]	' no , i do n't think so . but <EOS> kind of ' that - that just sits for the girls , or when mrs martin . ' okay i 've got a teddy . ' '
[387/1000]	the man chuckled , shaking his head . " what about the others ? " holden said . " did n't do too many of them , " the man said . " they did them fast .
[388/1000]	" i 'm not sure if i should be proud of you , or not . you said , ' i do n't have any proof that your grandfather was killed , but did he . ' as much as
[389/1000]	" hello , my name is bob mason , and i will be your assistant for a while . " " sure , i 'll be around . " that made her smile and turn to go . it
[390/1000]	" good morning ! " i greeted the group , still feeling like shit today . " hey , evie . " logan rolled out of bed as i reached for the phone . " morning , guys
[391/1000]	" i was hoping to talk to the police , " she said . " they could tell you something about this place . " " and i 'm not sure that i 'm up to that , "
[392/1000]	you 're starting to sound like you 're in school . really ? yeah , sorry , i was just thinking you sounded like you wanted to go . i know , right ? anyway , i
[393/1000]	" that sounds like me . " " you know , i do n't know who started keeping you around . or , hell , i think i knew why . " she glared at me over the
[394/1000]	not this time . there was no way i was going to let this play out like this . if i told cole , this could be a set - up that would end with me going to the everneath
[395/1000]	" if you decide to go with me , i 'll have to convince them not to kill you . we 'll have a bigger army with us and even your dad will be able to put it all back
[396/1000]	" you were here when we stopped for lunch at the hotel ? " " i was . it 's not unusual . " " i guess you liked our room . " " of course there
[397/1000]	" and so you 'd know her ? " beth was still trying to make sense of what she was hearing . " yes . as i told you before , i have business with her father . "
[398/1000]	' but , ' i began , ' she was n't just in here ! she was outside in the alley ! ' ' there 's only one alley in this part of town , girly , ' kaspar
[399/1000]	what about his father ? was he okay ? this might be her only chance to get some answers . " it ai n't my place to decide what she 's doing , " he said firmly .
[400/1000]	the smile left my face shortly . " let 's make it work . " he nodded one last time and jogged towards the house . i watched him vanish around the bend . i sighed and then turned
[401/1000]	' not on your life . ' he said defensively . ' i agree joe , ' she said . ' that 's why i want you or me as a team . ' joe paused . how
[402/1000]	" i do n't know , " matt said quietly . " maybe i just ca n't get the image of another human being out of my mind . " " you 're saying you ca n't get it
[403/1000]	" are you feeling ill ? " ryan asks , taking my hand and pressing it to his lips . my eyes drop to the floor and i begin to nod , then look back up at logan ,
[404/1000]	the man was younger than the other occupants in the cabin ; there was a wealth of knowledge behind his youthful eyes , and his bearing was one of an accomplished storyteller . his voice carried the entire cabin except
[405/1000]	" we might need a few seconds to think about this . " " oh . " he was only half listening , absorbed in his thoughts . he did n't know who was in charge here , exactly
[406/1000]	but i was too confused and confused to help him at all . i turned toward sebastian in time to see him pull in his hand a piece of paper . he was holding something in his hand . the
[407/1000]	" i do n't want to know , " i told shane . i wanted him to know that he was better off without me . " i 'm saying it 's not cool . it 's not
[408/1000]	" yeah , " he said , half to himself , " what are we going to do ? " " we should do something about our ... differences , " i said and gave everyone a sly and
[409/1000]	i stopped as my stomach flipped over and my blood turned cold . the word " death " cut through me , making me sink onto the couch . " what the fuck , " i whispered .
[410/1000]	" so what happened ? " i asked . " he went for help and i did n't have any . i tried to get him to come back to the office , but he was stuck in traffic
[411/1000]	he did n't know how he was going to tell her that he wanted her to be free . how he was going to tell her they could n't stay together as husband and wife . what if he was
[412/1000]	" good , " he said . " how does first , what do you want now ? " i asked him not intending to be rude but wanting to talk to him . now . " i
[413/1000]	" well , let 's see , " ben spoke up as he checked his rear - view mirror . " i 'm one - eighty - five year old and have some very basic ideas . so , shall
[414/1000]	" oh , god , i ca n't believe he did . if i knew he 'd gotten in trouble for this i would n't have let him go to that stupid fundraiser . if i would've known we
[415/1000]	" this guy ? " " i think about my ex all the time . why should i remember all the bad shit that happened in my life ? it 's a pretty crappy life , but it seems
[416/1000]	" we must leave now . he would not be forgiving , " she whispered to herself , trying to put another ten feet of wall between their home and the monster . " he said he would see
[417/1000]	if the two had n't already started in on the same spiel , i would n't have noticed if their minds had n't been working so fast . " and if they do n't have any connection or anything like
[418/1000]	" what about the other things ? " lucas asked . i looked around at the other two boys , but they were gone . " i do n't know , " i said softly . " we
[419/1000]	" but she can be there , watching over you while you sleep . " " do n't be crazy . " " do not be daft . you can travel wherever you like again . you just
[420/1000]	" why do n't you guys go up with her to the back room ? i could use some coffee . i 'll meet you there in a minute . " " that 's ok , i 'll get
[421/1000]	she did not smile a smile that was as genuine as this night would ever manage to be . " i 'm not leaving . " he straightened , his gaze flashing through the crowd . " that 's
[422/1000]	she shook her head , but he could see the need in her eyes . his eyes narrowed , his throat constricted with the need to possess her , to possess her . he could n't stop the crushing desire
[423/1000]	" we need to keep moving , " she said softly . " it 's nearing eight o'clock and everyone that has any good wood stays within sight of the house . i ca n't risk dropping out now .
[424/1000]	" nothing . he 's just messing around with her . maybe that 's why she 's so angry with him . " " i need to ask her about the letters , " david said . " i
[425/1000]	you might be able to handle the day - to - day details of your job , he told himself . " did you find what you were looking for ? " " a copy of the diary
[426/1000]	" she 's coming , right ? " he looked up at the roof . it was still a couple of hundred feet down . " can we ? " brian hesitated . it was very quiet , even
[427/1000]	in the air , and down his back , his legs hung wide . his eyes had now rolled back , a tiny pink thread that curled slowly toward the top of his head . he had gotten that look
[428/1000]	i stepped <EOS> i was so angry . " so , i 'm pissed about the time you used to run away . " <EOS> you 're a - she - i - i - " i love
[429/1000]	" go on , " she said , lifting her skirt enough to reveal the pink and black garter trim . she stepped back , and when i slipped a finger underneath the hem , her eyes slid closed .
[430/1000]	" okay , i 'll be down in a minute . " she leaves , and i stand staring after her for a while as if a fog had drifted over me and turned it thick . but it
[431/1000]	" well , then , i guess you got your wish before the sun sets . so where 's that demon going to get his weapons , eh ? " the demon , known as shadow walker , was
[432/1000]	" it is not my dream , it is on a spiritual plane . my heart is telling me , ' now come ' . " after the meal , the sisters sat up , putting their heads together
[433/1000]	you really did say he 'd be there tonight . i did n't think it was because he just called you to go to a party . " she turned the volume down on her coffee cup and looked at
[434/1000]	her mind whirled , tried to decide what her next move should be . more importantly , if she left now , if she went at the pace of her heart would she convince herself that she was capable of
[435/1000]	no , i 'm not . i 'm all right . i 'm very much better . and you 're okay with what i do ? i 'm not in love with you , and i 'm no
[436/1000]	she waved her hand toward the building . " i have to talk to him . " sam scowled . " well then , we 'll get him and meet you back here in twenty minutes . "
[437/1000]	2 / seven - a 2 - four - three - eight - all - eyes 2 - seven - none 2 - eight 2 - nine 2 - nine 2 - ten
[438/1000]	" look , i just figured tonight was a really good time - " " i think we 'll be doing work . " he gave me a long , serious look . " you do n't think
[439/1000]	" yeah . that 'd be good . " " you got a few days to get your head together , but i 'm leaving tomorrow , so i 'm a half hour early so i do n't need
[440/1000]	" hey . " she smiled warmly , shaking my hand . i thought maybe she had heard the first time around from one friend to another , but she did n't seem to be paying me any attention .
[441/1000]	" it 's so simple ! do n't you want to see it ? " " what is it ? " " it is what the romans used to call the sacred book of secrets - the ancient
[442/1000]	he 'd heard her . he 'd caught those words as she 'd said them , and they had n't been comforting at all . they 'd been hell . " i figured if i could find a
[443/1000]	" no , but ... " i looked outside into the park again . " for the love of all that 's holy up there ... did my father actually bring her with him ? " " your father
[444/1000]	it also made sense that he 'd never been intimate with anyone , but something told her that he was well beyond experience , and though she wanted him again , she would n't lie , he was terribly different
[445/1000]	but if it 's a crime , even an innocuous crime , what the hell do we do about it ? we either get in the car and drive away , or we leave after they leave and just
[446/1000]	" yeah . " i was glad to remember that , a little . he got up and stood at the counter top . " okay , i 'll meet you inside . " he went outside and left
[447/1000]	" i ca n't breathe . " there was a crack from the crack and then a sharp whistle . i blinked and saw the black sky in the valley like a black cloud swirling above us .
[448/1000]	" you know , if you ever need anything from me , come be my guest . i 'd be happy to help you out with everything that 's going on . " " oh , thanks , but
[449/1000]	" if a witch knows the truth of your soul and accepts your vows then she is still in trouble . " before i could ask questions the church bell rang . as instructed , the two sisters went
[450/1000]	" it was the one named john , that 's why he came with you . " that did n't help . a flash of memory flashed through her mind . one minute she was holding her brother 's
[451/1000]	the kid looked the same as i remembered him : high cheekbones , high arched brow , and sharp , full lips . " take what you see is yours . it 's yours . " " you 're
[452/1000]	" yeah , it 's nice , " i said . the house was absolutely beautiful . rich hardwood floors lined the hallway , a staircase carved to look like a dragon 's head descended from the second tale
[453/1000]	" he 's good at everything . " her mouth gaped as she stared at him . he gave her a wry , self - deprecating smile . " sorry i made all of this so hard on
[454/1000]	he pulled me up and pushed me against the wall . his mouth captured mine , his tongue pushing inside with a teasing stroke . i parted my lips , my hands fisting the dress on his leg and pressing
[455/1000]	" she 's just so strong . " that sweet voice , so gentle . but there was an underlying note of fear ... " hold on , " he murmured encouragingly . " maybe she 'll let us
[456/1000]	i was very near the edges , not very far past the edge of the horizon . i was not standing under any real observation , but i could feel it , the wind , rippling the surface of the
[457/1000]	the people within the crowd turned quickly to look at his approach and she smiled into their eyes . they seemed to understand her . " ah , lady . you have friends too , " said one of
[458/1000]	for the moment there was nothing to do but remain and wait . he looked around . above him in the moonlight , at least fifty or so dead birds stood . below him , his father was still and
[459/1000]	" and ? " she prompted . he stared at the mirror as if he 'd forgotten how to do it . his expression was inscrutable . " and ... i found this . " she glanced at
[460/1000]	he shrugged . " the thing is - we have nothing . " we 'd all gone through so much together i supposed i needed to be a little more honest . " there 's nothing in this world
[461/1000]	" it 's like working for a corporation , what they love . like having lots of money and trying to blend in . but you have to know how to run it . so , if you make the
[462/1000]	i shook my head repeatedly . " not here . let 's go back . please . " he seemed torn not to tell me something else , but he did n't want his son to know about it yet
[463/1000]	" yes , love , " he said . " i feel the same way . " he ran his hand down her spine , and she shivered with the heat of it . without further ado , she unfastened
[464/1000]	" what is it ? " " i just ca n't understand why she would keep it a secret from somebody who 's supposed to be her best friend . " " really ? are you sure you
[465/1000]	" go home and get you some good medical attention . stop drinking . do you understand me ? " her eyes narrowed . it seemed like a long - lost mother 's plea to her young daughter .
[466/1000]	" uh , yeah - " " i think . " a shrug . " i would n't have much time to get to know that woman if we did n't have to take care of a business .
[467/1000]	i ca n't stop saying what i do n't want to say . how does anyone make a decision like this ? not every teenager 's life is cut short because of decisions made by not only their parents but
[468/1000]	" what happened to the new man ? " tom asked . " he went home , " mr. browley said as he stepped outside . " you know him ? " he asked chris . " he
[469/1000]	" thanks for that . " tom nodded . " you ready for the class this year ? " " nah . just got back . " the music was booming within the room . the music had
[470/1000]	" what kind of house is this ? " i know it wo n't be fancy - i 'm the one who wo n't stay here . " is this a cabin or something ? " i ask . i
[471/1000]	" i 'm your dad , so that makes you my son , " dad said . he always said , " we both know i can take care of myself . " the moment they are alone ,
[472/1000]	a long , silence followed . it was all the prompting i needed to be sure there were no final tricks going on in this room , i lifted my gaze to her to see what made the tension ,
[473/1000]	the driver 's eyes narrowed in thought . then the driver leaned forward , peering deep into damon a foot under the hood . " nice car , " he said , as though there were something in the
[474/1000]	" yeah . " he took a bite , washing it down with more beer . " so she said i should let you know that she 's not so eager to marry you , because of the ' you
[475/1000]	" what would you like to talk about ? " it was a question i 'd asked the moment he left and i could n't bring myself to ask it . " i 'm sorry for what i said
[476/1000]	" no . i asked you . " " i want to work at a gym in town . i want to earn more money by going to the gym . " " a gym ? that was
[477/1000]	the little girl put her hands in her coat pockets and made a noncommittal noise . " i read it at the school . why do n't you come in ? " " you did n't read it ?
[478/1000]	his brows came together and he scowled at me . " if you 're not so f * * kin ' drunk , babe , i 'd figure that out . " " stop using in a way that
[479/1000]	i looked at her sideways , and she looked back , then sat down . i could n't read anything . " is everything okay ? you have n't said more than a few words to me in months
[480/1000]	" what ? " he could see she was getting ready to speak and kept looking around . finally he caught the slightest hint of frustration in her voice and knew she was coming around <EOS> and even before
[481/1000]	my heart has been beating so hard that it 's almost painful . " i got your letters a few months ago and since i have n't spoken to them , i did n't bother searching for them . "
[482/1000]	" thanks . " i 'm in complete shock . i can not express how much they are all saying , or how much they look , or how much they want to get me together with all of them
[483/1000]	" so , are we finished here ? " she asked . " yes , " he answered shortly . " now i 'm going to run down to my office to pick up a few things . i
[484/1000]	" so what she says is true , " said an old woman in a wrinkled old voice . " the people ... you know what happens to our people . " " we are a danger to her
[485/1000]	there were n't words of encouragement or relief . she had n't ever been so scared in her life as she was right now . there was a distant sound - an engine ? - coming from the rear
[486/1000]	he looked at me . " you 'll meet me outside the library at midnight . " " and you 'll come by the main building , right ? " " right , " he said .
[487/1000]	" at least you 're going ! " she shrieked . " you ca n't tell anyone about me ! i mean no one but you and everyone else will believe you ! " " who would believe me
[488/1000]	i did n't have to tell myself that in that moment , i could n't think that way . i needed to remember that he was n't the biggest fan of dating or me , and right then i wanted
[489/1000]	she looked up into his eyes , and what moved there still was n't surprise and surprise . just pure , honest concern . it made her feel cherished . it made her want a friend who did n't have
[490/1000]	his arm comes around my waist , pulling me into his body . i shiver as the cold in his embrace makes me shiver , hoping the only reason i 'm covered in sweat is because of my excitement over
[491/1000]	i was thinking about what you said earlier and how you 'd used your dad 's relationship with her to cover a major breakup with my parents . the phone rang then , and as i picked up the
[492/1000]	she nodded slowly . " very well . but you 're doing one hell of a job on this one . i do n't want you to die in a fire or something and do n't want you to die
[493/1000]	he looked at his watch and frowned . he let out a short deep breath and started to pace back and forth , just to get the fire going . the fire burned beneath him but it was only an
[494/1000]	my mouth opens , but i do n't say a word . i stand rooted to the spot like a moron , staring at him as though he has a giant brain . ' come on , ava .
[495/1000]	" what was he doing at the pier ? " he asks . " has he been taking his medication ? " " does it matter ? " i asked angrily , thinking that i sounded like an unreasonable
[496/1000]	she stood stock - still , listening to the footsteps coming down the stairs . she was trying to decide whether she should wait for a moment or to go up and get him . he was probably with the
[497/1000]	" i thought i saw something , " i protested . " with the darkness ... " she shrugged . " never know with the undead , i guess . it 's harder to tell without a better -
[498/1000]	" it 's just as well , " she said . " to be a little angry at a man for the wrong reason , to believe god is n't paying you for an entire life 's worth of pain
[499/1000]	" okay , okay . but do n't say it 's your fault . i want you to be happy . " " yes , i 'm happy , but no one 's ever been happy for me .
[500/1000]	" he was talking about the world ending , " said shadow . ' he talks about how people started to die off - the age of some forty thousand people , on the white side of the divide ,
[501/1000]	how much would a good man really know of this world , when he did n't know how to live it ? i was n't asking a lot of questions that could only be answered honestly in the end
[502/1000]	i shook my head . " no . what are we supposed to do , then ? go to the prom with them ? get a few beers with them again while we make out ? " " you
[503/1000]	they all nodded <EOS> - as if they were all a little . the captain had the long scar from the last time from his arm or his right front . he felt that the badge in her hair
[504/1000]	' i mean ... ' we stood in silence for a few seconds . his words and the image we may be sharing began to blur . ' kaspar my father has a son . a son he has
[505/1000]	" you can put something in the syringe , if you like . we do n't take medicine around here , " dr. abrams said , standing . " but you can get stuff a little closer . i think
[506/1000]	now i could see my father again : dad 's lean face , and his dark brown eyes as deep as midnight . how i missed looking into them , seeing the look they 'd worn the day he 'd
[507/1000]	he glanced around the room , then back at her . " how are you so sure i wo n't take out a knife on you or have you stabbed tonight ? " she laughed with relief . "
[508/1000]	" i am . " and he is , for once , right . and , yeah , that was his answer ; that girl has brains like a junkyard dog , too . as the party moves on
[509/1000]	' does some of my stuff have the feel of something familiar ? ' i asked . i wondered whether i 'd been put off <EOS> little toys that was my mum , or even to ... well , what
[510/1000]	i nodded , not at all surprised . " yes , " i said . " if you 'd like i can try another weapon ? " he shrugged , not quite moving , and his smile widened ,
[511/1000]	" yeah . " " well , he said it 's okay for you to be in the hospital since he could n't be in there to watch over you himself , and i told him you should stay
[512/1000]	my gaze landed on my dress , then slid to him in a slow , deliberate rush , as if <EOS> thick , my lap . i had wondered that i 'd seen in a hot spot . it had
[513/1000]	" i want you , " he repeated . " i want you too , " she whispered against his mouth . " so much i 'm too scared not to touch you . but you have to give
[514/1000]	" well excuse me , mr. president , and all you want me to do is fly the boat , but i do n't think i can do that either . i think i 'll just lie back and relax
[515/1000]	the men pulled away , and began to climb the stairs . " where are they ? " the female voice demanded . a small female replied , " they are gone . " anna 's brain
[516/1000]	she 'd been right about the clothes she had on . they looked awful all worn out . since when to wear nice clothes . they had been sitting beside him on the sofa for a while . still ,
[517/1000]	" it 's not good , darling , " he whispered against her ear . " i did n't want to leave , " she whispered back , her arms sliding around his neck . " i would have
[518/1000]	the next day we all did , and with the exception of one little dog that needed a little attention , we did n't leave any room to complain . my stomach got sick , and my mind started
[519/1000]	it turned out we were n't the only ones who 'd been through that . there were some faces from other graves in town . " what happened ? " " someone - someone like me - was murdered
[520/1000]	" then where 'd you learn to fight like this ? what did grandpa do ? " " one of my teachers had some issues with my latin . i wanted to help him out . " "
[521/1000]	" yeah ? when ? do the rest of the team know or are they still doing the test ? why do n't you have it on you ? " " i 'm just helping out . "
[522/1000]	" i do n't understand how i got involved ; i mean , it 's probably obvious that i 've picked up some terrible habits from my boss . maybe i should go home ? " " that 's
[523/1000]	" the council might demand what you offer , " he said . " your father probably would n't give me any of the money , and you 're the one who did this to me . " "
[524/1000]	" now , i have some issues to fix , " adam said . " tell me about them . " he sighed . " i have a lot of memories of my childhood that have been forgotten
[525/1000]	" there is no reason to believe that we will be found without aid from that direction . you have all passed . " " we have heard that many people have been murdered . " " that
[526/1000]	' when you come off of that , miss cassidy , you should wear a collar too ! it looks good on you - and you 've been in here for about an hour . ' the old man
[527/1000]	how could i tell them ? they all would think i was a whore or something . one of them asked , " are you sure you do n't want to marry him ? " they could
[528/1000]	her gaze still locked on the guy , eve said , " you were n't at the bar with us , were you ? " shane looked at her , then back at the guy . the cop
[529/1000]	" i think it 's good . they were going back to their old ways . they 'd decided to go their own way . they 'd grown weary of the constant stress . they took their new lives of
[530/1000]	" no thanks , i do n't think so , " i said . " i want to , " a low , masculine voice said . it had a commanding voice that was not my own .
[531/1000]	" i do . " she laughed at me and my feet barely touched the floor . i spun toward her as she pressed her hips into mine . " kiss me , please , " she groaned against
[532/1000]	" what 's it like ? " " strange , too . like none of us had been to this place before . " before . that 's what the voices had said . after .
[533/1000]	" what else did they say ? " she asked as he handed her the glass of wine he 'd prepared after breakfast . " that the last five months will help , but i 'm afraid they 're
[534/1000]	they went out onto the veranda and sat down at the table in the middle of the veranda like they used to . she lit her cigarettes and pushed the pack across the table . " did n't there ever
[535/1000]	" fuck , " i mumbled . " go . talk to her . come <EOS> all . " i looked around . and i had a second once and one for one and make - at stuff like
[536/1000]	" we did n't think we should talk to your dad , anyway , " tom said . " nobody had any reason to think that he might be trying to send a message to you . " it
[537/1000]	" what the fuck is he doing ? ! " ian shouted . " it 's like he wanted to eat this shit before , obviously , " michael murmured , as if a stranger could possibly answer him
[538/1000]	i shake my head . i ca n't help it . he was exactly right . " you 're mine , camryn . not this guy . " then i understand . he wants me - <EOS> -
[539/1000]	she stopped on the opposite side of the door from the ones he 'd just shut . he started over and started again a minute later , getting closer to her . she turned her head to the side just
[540/1000]	all of a sudden , the thought of being stuck in his room made her feel uncomfortably nak * d. even worse , it became apparent to her that she had no idea where or how she was going to
[541/1000]	the man sat up . " can it be ? " " can what be ... ? " " can god be a dog ? " he looked back at me with shining eyes . " can anyone
[542/1000]	" look to the west , " the sheriff pleaded . " it 's all set up there . " " not for me . " tom went back to the fire and bent over his fire .
[543/1000]	" you will , " i said as the bell rang for the end of lunch . ms. chil dress pushed her bulk out of her chair , looking professional in her dark grey pants and yellow sweater ,
[544/1000]	john took one look at jim 's expression when they brought him over to his first - floor apartment . his gaze went to amanda . " something wrong ? " colin cleared his throat . " i 'll
[545/1000]	" i believe i am . " " what did you do ? " " found her . " " and she thought you meant her ? " " i 'm not sure how she did
[546/1000]	" i - i 'm sure your mother will be happy to learn of our meeting . but i do n't know her ... " michael did n't wait for him to finish . he reached up and grabbed
[547/1000]	" i will , my lord . " i got her dressed , thanked her and took her from there . the coach rolled at a snail 's pace , and the sun grew hotter than a summer day
[548/1000]	' that 's good , ' said ' one of the guards . ' ' no , of course not , ' said the older man . ' my job was to run the empire . i could never
[549/1000]	for a moment he simply stared at her . the emotion in his eyes made his whole face tighten . in two strides she moved around the bed and was standing in front of him in nothing but a
[550/1000]	" you 're already there , " ian said , standing when she did . " have some more wine . " " thank you . " he kissed her cheek and gently set her down on the
[551/1000]	" this is n't back world . " he glanced at her , surprised by her tone . she sounded ... disappointed . " here , " she began , her tone so soft he had no idea
[552/1000]	and now , like a flash of lightning , a flash of blue light showed up , bright and intense . i sat up , and in that moment , i could see everything clearly . the way the
[553/1000]	they were all that mattered at the moment . ' the black cloud , ' dreadaeleon whispered through clenched teeth . ' we 're too close . ' that i did n't miss before did n't really matter
[554/1000]	" let 's go inside , " said george . she let him guide her through the back door . " come in , " george said , " have a seat . " she sat in
[555/1000]	i can see his jaw tense as he swallows . when he catches himself , he says , " i was n't ... " " it 's hot in here . " " yes . " i
[556/1000]	he touched a finger to the lump beneath her chin . " i wo n't let it happen again . i 'm a strong man , baby . i 'll find a way to tame you . " she
[557/1000]	" what 's that , " said a voice close to his ear . " you can tell me anything at all . " " you 're right , " steve said , thinking about talking to jennifer ,
[558/1000]	the sound of his boots , the clicking of the shackles , the slight swish of his robe on the stone floor followed me as i walked out of the cell and down the stone hallway . every room had
[559/1000]	mike sat with his hands open . he looked at tom and shook his head and said nothing for a moment in silent communication . then in a low voice , he said " do n't stop , there 's
[560/1000]	" they 're hard to find . i guess we ca n't trust them . " he gave me a stern look . " you are going to be fine , right ? i just hope it 's enough .
[561/1000]	we sat there in the darkness , it was n't long before i got a whiff of his scent again . i sat up slightly and smelled cinnamon . " you smell good , " sam told me the
[562/1000]	as you have no doubt guessed , our greatest enemy here ; the undead , " - the captain paused - " was the vampires . after we captured the world - burner the military had grown suspicious . they
[563/1000]	" i 'll get the list with you , " he answered . " but the sooner you talk , the sooner i 'll get you settled in the apartment instead of the hotel , " he said sternly .
[564/1000]	for once , she did n't push this issue along on her own . her only concern was telling dylan about the date with simon . as soon as she was out of the room , he gave her that
[565/1000]	but she knew he would n't . * * * " what happened before we left ? " nicole looked up , a startled frown etching her pretty features . derek knew his face was hard
[566/1000]	" if you do n't want anything from me , why are you here ? should n't i have known ? " it was that damn - fool 's word that drew me back to the room . i
[567/1000]	jack frowned . i 'm not proud of my past , but somehow , at the time , i 'd believed it completely . until tonight . " i 'm sorry , " she went on .
[568/1000]	" it will probably be nothing , " i said . he looked dubious , but said nothing . his thumb stroked the curve of my hip , small circles against my skin . " did you have
[569/1000]	it was as dark and empty as the crypt in the chamber below that he awoke to the smell of horses in the camp beyond the gate . chapter 16 there was no light where they had escaped
[570/1000]	" and this is your office ... ? " i ask . " this is a security room , and this is a storage storage room , so when they do n't pick up the mail they usually look
[571/1000]	" as soon as dad found out , he was so pissed at mom , so angry at us . one thing led to another , and he went crazy . it was all he could do not to go
[572/1000]	" i know , " she said , without blinking , but her voice was sharp and quick as it had become . " he looks after me , too . " that was n't possible . she had
[573/1000]	' we are coming , ' he declared . ' but what if they find the passage to the valley ? what then ? ' ' the guards will fight this way . on the count they will
[574/1000]	after our walk , i said , " you 're tired . " " i 've been working really hard <EOS> ... i just for some research in the office . " " yeah , " i think
[575/1000]	this was going to play out well . he had a meeting with a senator , one of his competitors , and he was going to turn this thing around to be the most profitable piece of work possible .
[576/1000]	a moment later , she came up for air . " you should have just gotten a goddamn flat tire like most men . " he caught her shoulders and pulled her against his hard body . " nope
[577/1000]	i can tell this was part of the game . " are you serious ? " i felt a sick ball of terror in my stomach . " you 're going to kill me ? " " no
[578/1000]	" okay , " jack said . " get your facts and get in touch with us when you take him away . " i turned to my husband . " how was your time with them .
[579/1000]	" i 'll send them right by , " he promised . " you stay with your brother . " he held the door open with his shoulder . " if you get in trouble ; come and find me
[580/1000]	" i know that , " emma says as she waves her hand and then slowly turns and goes down the staircase , her arms empty of the coat that she had on before she left . " it
[581/1000]	this is where it gets dangerous , i thought suddenly . i should just stay quiet and let him talk , wait for the rest . i could hear him breathing loudly next to me . he knew he had
[582/1000]	" i feel like i 've always been the one fighting and is finally ready to give up and follow your own heart . " i said . " so so now you think you 're ready to just
[583/1000]	" how 's it taste ? " he yelled . " good or bad ? " she could n't speak past the lump in her throat . " very good . " " because you 're not gon
[584/1000]	" what ? " " his whole family came here . and he only remembered their deaths . " " was there a ransom note left ? " " yes . there was . i found it
[585/1000]	" what is this ? " i asked . " it 's a note . my name is dean , " he said , closing his eyes and looking more peaceful than i 'd ever seen him .
[586/1000]	and then there was the fact that despite their best efforts , she 'd given up on being useful ... and failed miserably . when she saw the smug expression on his face , she realized she 'd just done
[587/1000]	i get the feeling that he would never tell her so ... i 'm relieved . " well , i can promise you this . no one is going to be taking me seriously with my face plastered on
[588/1000]	the music has ceased now the time was when i saw him dance . now it does n't even slow down any more ; it just goes on and on in the background . i stood inside a theater to
[589/1000]	i 'm sure they all knew what i meant . the women did n't know one thing about the news channel . like me , they were stunned . " yes , " i said , almost un
[590/1000]	" if you 're a good man , i promise i wo n't try to kill you . " she smiled weakly . he wrapped his hands around her face and gave her a tight hug and whispered into
[591/1000]	the man was n't going to answer . " i 'll drive ya . " he 'd tried , but when i stared in silence , he looked like he was trying to re construct the dream he had the
[592/1000]	" yeah , i do . " i sighed and stood up , watching him as he pushed away from the door and stormed down the hall . " good morning , dear , " my grandmother greeted me
[593/1000]	a couple of blocks from the hospital , dr. wilson and a young man stopped at a gas station for ice cream . the woman was in a seat by a vending machine , her purse in her lap .
[594/1000]	i 'd be wrong , if that truth had been the one i needed to hear . i nodded . " now , let 's find out . " i lifted a hand to hold my hair
[595/1000]	she turned around , but she could see nothing beyond the fence , no doubt going back to her own apartment or the main hotel or even at the hotel . " have you seen my brother lately ? "
[596/1000]	" well , excuse me . i am the new guardian and , i ask that you do n't fight me anymore . " " i 'm sorry , but , who said anything about fighting you anymore ?
[597/1000]	" not if the queen of england can help it . " " that could be a problem . " i stood up , the room spinning . " how does she know about me ? " "
[598/1000]	when he spoke , the dark brown of his eyes was suddenly so icy blue that it was almost mesmerizing . " you 'll be living in my house , but i have n't bought it yet . i do
[599/1000]	" you 're the next in line . " " so ... " " so , i wish it were you . " he laughed out loud . " now that , huh ? " i
[600/1000]	' well , there 's nothing to ask this girl if this is beyond the realms of the ordinary . she 's looking in our direction . ' a couple of figures moved into view , approaching the clearing
[601/1000]	she frowned a bit . " he 's not my father . " " he 's a lot of things , but that does n't mean he 's worth bringing you all the way down here with him .
[602/1000]	she started to back away . he reached out , placing a hand gently to her back . " you do n't have to be scared of me . " he frowned . " you just seem nervous . that
[603/1000]	the three men were in some kind of arena . with a hundred thousand faces around them , it was too obvious for those on the ground to take their eyes off the performers . for the first time
[604/1000]	i looked around and saw two tall young men behind me speaking in low tones . the other was wearing a well - tailored shirt , dark slacks , and had quite an impressive ass . when i looked
[605/1000]	" can you take that ? " she looked down at the ring and back to him . " absolutely . " " then i 'm going to need to make a choice , " he said with
[606/1000]	i heard the little clunk of the bell , which signified i had ordered pizza . i picked up my glass and sipped . " what do you like to eat ? " i asked . " pizza
[607/1000]	" so , i 'll just catch up together after lunch , and you can ask me all the questions you want to . " a small smile curved her beautiful lips as he led her to the stairs
[608/1000]	please , jesus , please - " do what you must . " i should have known that voice . fuck . i pressed my head against his shoulder and put my back to him . i
[609/1000]	" she told me she 'd seen you leave just before sunrise . were you on your way to work early ? " " i 'd have been , and yes i was . she left me several
[610/1000]	you must learn some lesson from that , jane - she is not one of those women . you have seen what happens to the poor , most often . take this . and yet . your hands will seem
[611/1000]	i have more than one problem with mom . if she ca n't find her daughter 's passport , or with every dollar i have , mom ca n't give me anything that i need . everything mom could ever
[612/1000]	" do n't be too hard on him , " his fiancee said as she came up to him with her sister in tow . " he 's a very polite , if somewhat bitter man . " "
[613/1000]	she glanced down at the floor , suddenly unnerved by her newfound intimacy with the man before her . she was n't certain how her courage could have lasted this long and yet , in a moment of weakness
[614/1000]	" you can help me get him out . " " i do n't know if he can get free . i 'm hoping he can stand on his own . " jack glanced at the ceiling ,
[615/1000]	his lips were n't moving . " adam ! " i hissed . at least i got his attention . it took about two seconds to get giguhl into a good position to act . his eyes widened
[616/1000]	" yeah . i hate to be the one to break it to you , but i 'm still underage . " " that 's all your parents have ever cared about , is n't it ? what about
[617/1000]	" you 're a hard one to get away from . " " so are you . ever since we met , your panties have been in a bunch . " my head snapped up . " you
[618/1000]	" i do n't want to see to her soul . " i feel the tears well up and i drop my head . " i just ... need to let her go . " i feel his hand
[619/1000]	" you sure that 's such a great idea on your part ? what if someone sees us together ? " he shrugged . " well , come on then . " as if sensing his mounting excitement
[620/1000]	" what ? " she exclaimed . " that 's ridiculous . it just - it 's silly that you 'd agree to do that . " " how do you know ? " " just do it
[621/1000]	" you have n't seen a damn thing , " james responded defensively . " i was just ... what do you want to call it ? my curiosity ? " " curiosity , as in you 're
[622/1000]	" you got it . " it was hard to stay quiet . all these people were going through a lot . it was just easier to remain quiet . it was easier to feel the stress of the
[623/1000]	they did n't have long to wait until a passing car sent them toward the other side of the road . out of the corner of his eye , sam saw the man with the small pistol start firing .
[624/1000]	" when did we have an issue ? " he snapped . " all of a sudden i 'm the one asking to talk ? it 's not like we were n't having trouble talking the last time . "
[625/1000]	" i know . " she looked at me , looking at my face . " because we 're friends . " her tone was just as dry . " that 's why i 'd always been your
[626/1000]	he kept going . she felt his hands grip her hips again , pressing it into the bed , pushing between her thighs . she gasped and arched her back to meet him . " i want to take
[627/1000]	her breath was coming fast and shallow as chase released her . he sat back in his seat , obviously waiting for her to say something . " what is it ? " he asked . she clenched
[628/1000]	" we have this in common . " she looked a bit uncomfortable . " i 'm afraid i really think it is a little too soon . " he nodded . she was right . " we
[629/1000]	she slid onto the desk next to a stack of paperwork and picked a copy of the latest business agreement . as soon as a title entry appeared , she clicked on it and a stack of five pages filled
[630/1000]	" fine . " " maybe your father wants you to get better , but a mental health clinic does n't talk to us . and if it did n't , you 're asking yourself where a good therapist
[631/1000]	" the idea that there might be a vampire out there , " i said , " would bother me if i did n't know it was there . the problem is that i do n't . " "
[632/1000]	" not tonight , sweetheart . after i take care of this . " " get the f * * k out of there , you dick . " his hands left my head and went away .
[633/1000]	" you made me - " he began . " no you did n't . and i made you so damn beautiful . " before she could ponder why for another moment , she kissed him . hard
[634/1000]	" i did not lie when i told you i had told her no , " said the wolf 's twin . " what i said to her the night you left was true ; but i saw it only
[635/1000]	" i said yes to you . " " i heard you already . the reason i did n't say anything was before i saw his wedding ring on her finger last night and saw you with her when
[636/1000]	" so there is a chance these men might be murderers ? " i ask , ignoring his smirk . " did they say why ? " " no , just that they did n't like murder .
[637/1000]	" i did n't leave you then . " " that 's another tough question if i ever heard it . " " you did n't leave me . " she sounded different . almost more mature .
[638/1000]	" of course . " " it sounds like your mom knows you 're in nashville , " she observed , following me across the lobby , " and that she 's waiting for you . " "
[639/1000]	" yes , " she lied through clenched teeth . " so to help your sister through the night , i think you 'd like some company . " " you do n't even know me . i
[640/1000]	" i do n't really know either until my memory comes back . " he had a faint smile on his face . " we were attacked by the fae when we were kids trying to make it to the
[641/1000]	" maybe i 'm just paranoid . " " no , it 's not . there 's nothing to be afraid of . " " that 's just it . i 'm in my car and i 'm
[642/1000]	" no , no , no , so much , " he says , shaking his head . " i should have known you 'd turn me away only because i did n't understand you . when did you get
[643/1000]	* * * " please , do n't leave . " my voice was shaky now . i did n't know what was wrong with me . i did n't feel in any kind of shape to take care
[644/1000]	i nod my head and smile at mr. ama deo . " i guess we ought to be getting his gear packed up , do n't we ? " i say . " if you can find a spot
[645/1000]	" then i have something to tell you . you wait here . " his gaze never wavered . " if you try and leave , i will blow up the plane . make it explode , but if you
[646/1000]	or that she was crazy . " when ? " he demanded again . she nodded once . " by the way , i 'm pretty sure that 's impossible . " to him , that sounded
[647/1000]	their conversation came to an abrupt halt as a loud booming voice thundered out of the courtyard . " to me ! " the three brothers slowly turned to see hades striding toward them . the only illumination that
[648/1000]	" we 'll go to the next town over . i was thinking you might enjoy some hiking in the range , if you took me around a bit , " said jim , adding hopefully , " and we
[649/1000]	he was in a circle of chairs around a small table . at the center of the circle , perched on a chair were four four - legged stools , each with a square , rounded surface . the table
[650/1000]	he made her feel very vulnerable and it ripped through her that he could feel it . " all right , okay , " he said quickly . " deal . but we ca n't have that if you
[651/1000]	" really , sir , " he said . " i really need to call my wife and let her know i wo n't be home for dinner until late tonight . " she blinked . " ah ,
[652/1000]	from out of the corner of my eye , i watched as he turned away and headed down the hall . the door shut , and i ran for the stairs , cursing . i had only seconds to
[653/1000]	' no - o , nothing like that , ' she said hastily . ' no , i 'm fine . ' she glanced at him , but was looking for a way out . ' will you look before
[654/1000]	i had known - from the beginning of the race , from the start - that the only difference between being female and men did n't exist ( but still i had been too careful not to say so )
[655/1000]	" but it does n't seem that way to me , " i lied , my shoulders slumped in defeat . i 'd expected to get the chance to move on with my life and start fresh , and soon
[656/1000]	" no wonder you seemed interested in my mother . i did n't know she 'd been killed when i was ten years old . that 's so sad . " i almost looked away , but i did
[657/1000]	he looked over his shoulder at the road , but it was hard to tell what side was up and where it was going . with the bright headlights , it looked different as well as beautiful . " this
[658/1000]	" thanks . i guess . " he looked more angry than he looked stunned . " right . you told me you liked me . i think you even told me you loved me , did n't you
[659/1000]	i glanced at the clock on the dash , not wanting to go to bed yet . i had a big day that started at six but needed to start early and then work until midnight . as we
[660/1000]	" wow , " he replies . " that 's almost as beautiful as you . let 's get your clothes . " he starts leading me out of my closet , not stopping as he comes alongside me
[661/1000]	even though she 'd fallen and her head hit the stone floor , he still held her with both arms . oh . my . god ... she felt his lips on her throat , the soft brush
[662/1000]	he looked past me , where the shadows were stretched behind the bushes . " you could have come over there . " " no , " i said , looking down . " i could n't . "
[663/1000]	" not really . he 's a little weird . i just ... it 's my day off . " " i would help you get in . we just found a bed together . " " that
[664/1000]	he tried to understand . if she was n't in the habit of seeing him at the gym a few times a week , she must know him better than anyone else did . if she did n't realize yet
[665/1000]	" what 're you doing here ? " he demanded in a low voice . i smiled in spite of myself . " uh , " i looked at the ground and shuffled back toward him . " i
[666/1000]	' very , ' said a woman 's voice , full of fear . the man relaxed , and his voice became strangely happy . ' now , you 've got to be the bravest woman i 've ever
[667/1000]	" it 's not just you , " i tell him . " i 'm also saying that today is n't the day of the choosing . " i tell him what we both know would be true : i
[668/1000]	' you 're pretty good at that . ' that made me laugh even more . ' yeah ; but i work too hard . i get sick of being told what to do . ' i told her
[669/1000]	" where are you going ? " he asked , but she would n't answer . a part of her was torn that she was going with him . and part of her was scared . " out .
[670/1000]	" a lot of people in the organization are either dead by the end of the month , " she said . " they 're all dead now , " i told her . " except maybe harold .
[671/1000]	her voice rose to a shriek , the hair on the nape of her neck standing up . " jesus christ , look at that one . she 's a looker ! " " uh - huh ,
[672/1000]	" he 's my son , " she said . " i know very well what i 'm doing . " " you could do it again , " he told her . " i do n't want
[673/1000]	how that 's all right , boy - who wants it more ? " we both knew what was coming , of course . it would be easy for her to take the pain from his voice , to
[674/1000]	" why are you in such a hurry to destroy the royal bloodline ? " she demanded , the sharp color rising in her cheeks to match her hair and clothes . " all we are , are , is
[675/1000]	" and how 's <EOS> ? " " not getting tired of walking the streets . " " not much fun . it 's like walking with your arms on your shoulders , but too big for your
[676/1000]	the doctor continued to ask questions and nod when his eyes moved to james ' lips . this young man looked at james ' eyes and after a short time , he raised an eyebrow and nodded . "
[677/1000]	" hey , i think we could 've done this again , if you want . " " yeah , but if we 'd ... i 'll stop . " " agreed , " he said . he
[678/1000]	it was the sound of a man 's voice , one that came from what seemed to be a very large room ; it seemed to echo across the empty room until it drew out into the hall , and
[679/1000]	it was a long flight . or rather , the longest flight she 'd ever taken anywhere . she had no worries of course , and every time she entertained more worries about going back to d.c. again she
[680/1000]	" what is wrong with you , boy ? why do you think one of them was killed ? that one could be so bad , he could be very powerful . " i stopped , staring at him
[681/1000]	" so that puts these four in a whole different category , do n't it ? " she replied , nodding her head . " that was an incredibly stupid thing to do . you should have stayed out of
[682/1000]	" she 's an emotional , " i say . " she does n't know what to do or what to say when someone says something to upset her . <EOS> just in a way she was . she loves
[683/1000]	" just trying to make you laugh , " james replied . my smile grew . that was all i needed . " i guess you 're getting bored with me . " he shook his head .
[684/1000]	" who did what to you ? " i said quietly , " jack and me , " i explained swiftly and his eyes dropped to my mouth . " i was scared , jake . " his
[685/1000]	she nodded . i needed to get out of the heat . " i 'll make you some coffee while you shower . " " thanks , " i said , my voice sounding hollow . " i 'll
[686/1000]	" what happened so far ? " " we were attacked by the people who owned our home . " " who ? " " my mother 's security team . " " what do you
[687/1000]	" what was that all about ? " asked claire . she 'd been curious what he 'd been doing since their walk to breakfast . " my family gets together to discuss the past , " he said
[688/1000]	" <EOS> " - he had n't been prepared for the cold . " i 'm sorry . " she looked away uncomfortably . " but the guy said he only came to get me and that you were

[690/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " " there is nothing out there . a whole herd of them , waiting to kill something and take it back to their masters . " " i will come , "
[691/1000]	' that 's right , she 's here ! ' after a few moments the black widow made her way over to where a large , heavy looking , green and tan buick pulled up . ' hello ,
[692/1000]	" sorry , " he muttered and turned away to hide her amusement . " thanks for your help . i 'll let you know if i have an idea as to who may be after me to be careful
[693/1000]	she felt the tension drain from her body , and was glad it was over as shane reached for her and pulled her close . it did n't leave her with much time to think , but she sighed and
[694/1000]	" good , " he said , leaning back into his chair . " how 's everyone ? any progress ? " " surprisingly , no . i took out all the surveillance files - everything that went on
[695/1000]	" you 're just being stubborn , " he accused , and something that looked like sadness filled her expression . " stubborn ? " " to sleep with a man who does n't seem to love you
[696/1000]	as i was returning to her , you could almost hear her calling in her head the song : i looked around the house , my eyes landing on her suitcases on the floor . she had packed her
[697/1000]	to his relief everyone else had shown the same emotion as they had the day before . the crowd relaxed a little . the man - child looked happy , as if nothing had changed <EOS> really had a couple
[698/1000]	" that 's what i thought . " as he reached the top hatch and opened it , the captain appeared . " you were right earlier , captain . the bridge was n't functioning the way it should .
[699/1000]	the black - haired man continued to stare at the man . one raised a gloved hand and said , " this is the daughter of an unknown man ; who have you brought to speak with me ? "
[700/1000]	well , i had the upper hand , since that would have been the best way to be sure . " the vampire and her family . yes , the vampire and her family . " " how did
[701/1000]	" so , " she began as he poured a packet of cream into his hand . " what 's your point ? " he set the packet on the desk and turned around with a smile . "
[702/1000]	her father laughed into the phone . " well , that 's a relief . i was n't ready to talk to you yet . " " me neither . so what 's on your mind ? " she
[703/1000]	" i do n't know , " i said truthfully . " do n't lie to me , " she warned . " i know just by looking at you . " " i 'm not lying to
[704/1000]	" how about a shower or a nice lunch before we begin . " her mouth twitched into a smile . " i 'm sure you wo n't mind . " " i love showers . " she
[705/1000]	she was still in a bad mood when we got home . " no , she does n't . " " great , " she muttered . i walked up to the kitchen and started slicing the

[707/1000]	i get ready for bed and he puts my necklace , this black emerald , back , then leaves my room . i get up in the dark and sit with my chin on my knees and get quiet .
[708/1000]	' the ship in question ? ' ' yes . ' ' it was carrying something - something that , in a few moments , would run out of fuel , we can no longer catch . then
[709/1000]	instead , she got up and headed into my bedroom . when she closed the door , i opened it to peek around the curtains , trying to get a sense of her state . i heard her moving
[710/1000]	" yes , " he whispered . he seemed to have lost the power to speak anymore . " why ? " i asked at last . " you have the cure inside of you . in you
[711/1000]	" do n't think so , " the teacher said . " you 'll just have to work harder at it . i bet this is a popular class , and you 're good at blending in , just the
[712/1000]	" you 're a little thing , " rachel said . " what ? " the woman said . " you look like you 're trying to kill yourself , " rachel said . " that 's
[713/1000]	no response . " i know what they 're called , or what they got - " " they got the big name . " " yes , but they got the bad guy . "
[714/1000]	i did n't know what she wanted . after all , our first date on the boardwalk was officially over . i was excited for her , and she was n't ready to admit that . i put on my
[715/1000]	" we are both young men . i have every trust and trust in the universe - including our own personal interest . we have spent much of our lives trying to bring harmony into this time . and despite
[716/1000]	" what else could you get her to do , you 've no clue ? " " we 're done for . " the second he said it , everything went quiet . everyone was quiet .
[717/1000]	jason sat down in a chair . there was a brief interruption between his own conversation with k ant , an interesting break in the one - sided conversations between the two of them that he had enjoyed for hours
[718/1000]	" no , sir . i 'm good at it . i 've never been in it so nice , though . " " the old man 's not here , then . he went out somewhere to talk
[719/1000]	" the men i saw when i went to find you were all dead . i found one man 's corpse lying still and his eyes open . it was too late for more soldiers . " " we
[720/1000]	" oh , you , mom and dad are n't in your room ? " i asked incredulously . mom 's mouth twitched and she said , " no , sweetie , we 're in our room . can
[721/1000]	and that 's the main reason i decided to play . if i were really that talented , i could probably have put this band 's music on a billboard in l.a. , written in my music and sent to
[722/1000]	" hello ? " " hey , " came tom 's startled voice . his voice squeaked in excitement . " are you on your way home ? " " no , i 'm stopping . i 'm
[723/1000]	i was so shocked that i almost did n't respond . " you look beautiful . " he took her hand , kissed it . then he stood on the foot of the bed and brought it to his
[724/1000]	" that 's right , " beth said , and nodded toward one of the windows that looked out over the street below . the sky was streaked by clouds of snow . " and i guess it starts between
[725/1000]	" then they must have decided to postpone the wedding for your sake . " he gazed at eleanor , his eyes narrowed . " i did not know he was such a good boy . " and
[726/1000]	" i 've always wanted to live on the beaches of africa . i would love to see a bit of the water . " the stewardess began checking their seat belts and said , " please be as
[727/1000]	" why are you in such a rush to return to the country ? " asked windsor . " i suppose that you are thinking of a final home journey ? " " yes , a final home journey
[728/1000]	i am aware of the pain of my own absence from the office staff . i look up at that realization . the fact is that i do n't want to leave . i ca n't live in a
[729/1000]	" or maybe they did n't know what color the eyes are . but they knew i was special . " she shook her head . " i know that 's crazy , but i think i 'm going to
[730/1000]	" uh , yes , " i said , turning <EOS> about to leave . " be careful , " he said and took my hand . " stay up here alone . you 'll never get home before
[731/1000]	he did n't say anything more as he left me in the hallway and walked down the hall . i ran after him , ignoring the bruises on the backs of my legs and arms and the red blood over
[732/1000]	i shake my head at him . " you were just going to tell her that you knew what she was after ? " " yeah , i was . " he laughs , then winces as if he
[733/1000]	and he is n't the only one . he touches the bracelet and it twitches . he reaches out to my face and i lean into him , trying to find a place where i can feel that
[734/1000]	" well , i like being with you , " she said . " that 's not easy for just anyone . i 'm sure people would be nice . " she smiled at him through the half open door
[735/1000]	" what would you say to that ? " i asked . her mouth curled up . " it needs to be said . " " can we go now ? " james muttered . we parted
[736/1000]	' we were watching the two friends get taken away by a big white truck . ' he looked around at everyone , ' was this your idea ? ' ' who knows ? ' ' i told
[737/1000]	a few minutes later , a small girl in a full - length flowered dress , with short blonde hair that framed her face , came into the cabin , dressed like the sisters , but with her shoulders back
[738/1000]	she glanced over at her father . he had one arm resting idly on his knee and the other resting on the arm of the chair as he listened to his wife . the twinkle in his eyes became even
[739/1000]	" well i 'm in time , " beth said , looking up from flipping a leaf in the newspaper . " huh , " ella said , " do you have to be one to hold a secret
[740/1000]	" i will , " she said , thinking about finding someone to take responsibility for the mess . " it 's too early for that . " " i can tell you what 's important , " he
[741/1000]	" he looked upset . did he tell you ? " " he did . did you tell someone ? " " never . " " did you make a copy of the e - mail ?
[742/1000]	the air was still humid while i stood over her , wringing my hands nervously between my face and shorts . i could n't help the shiver that shot from my neck to my feet . god , i was
[743/1000]	" this is n't just random , " she cried . there was a huge amount of tension between them and she hated it . where had all the bullshit gone ? how was she supposed to turn her anger
[744/1000]	she rolled her eyes . " this thing does not need a clock . it 's supposed to have an exact clock with all the numbers . " her expression was completely neutral as she continued , " yes .
[745/1000]	" you are n't what ? " it was an innocent question . i mean , how many questions could you pose to one person ? " i mean ... i 'm not sure if you could be your
[746/1000]	i sat straight up , my eyes wide as i gaped at him . " it 's that time of year , so maybe he 's decided we have some unfinished business . like , what we did in the
[747/1000]	" mr. greene , sit down , " jeff said , taking a seat next to her . " there is n't much time , " she said , " i have something that would help you out .
[748/1000]	so much for their mission objective . " can i get a message back to them for us ? " " i 'll get us a copy , if any . " the answer to that was a
[749/1000]	" i did n't say she , " said neville . " i thought it , " said merlin , thinking : we all do . as the three wizards were about to leave , someone in the
[750/1000]	" you know , do n't you ? " he said , breaking the silence with the question . the sudden intensity of his gaze made her feel like she was being hunted , and she glanced away

[752/1000]	" no , i did what was best for us and i failed , " he said . " if you 've been willing to throw yourself onto <EOS> - whatever you 've fallen in pain - then maybe -
[753/1000]	i was already on edge , wondering when he might bring it up . " he 's gone , right ? not that you want him back , i mean . it 's your dad 's problem . "
[754/1000]	" i 'm not as fragile as you make me out to be , " jace said mildly . " but one of the things that i really love about you is your determination - would n't the battle just
[755/1000]	" the truth will come out soon . " " yeah , but tonight , so do i. if we 're going , this is where he came from . he was here when dad died . " i
[756/1000]	" but i remember you looking so disappointed the first time , " he said , leaning onto the arm of the sofa . " i 've been in more miserable places in my life . " "
[757/1000]	then he turned his dark , unfathomable eyes on me and demanded , " now . " " but you said - " " now , " he repeated . " mitch - " " now
[758/1000]	i 'm pretty sure he knew his dad was up the street if he caught that . " you 're not on the bus ? " she asked when she could n't escape the awkwardness she felt .
[759/1000]	i would do everything imaginable to make sure i was well and truly well and completely happy . i 'd do anything to keep drake happy . with two bodyguards close by , i did n't have to
[760/1000]	she gave him the look that melted his heart . it was <EOS> <EOS> like the kind of look , he corrected : she was n't to those of the wild , and he and david did n't know what
[761/1000]	as she opened her mouth to reply , she heard another voice , barely distinguishable before she moved toward the door . " have a nice day , darlin ' . " * * * * *
[762/1000]	" the night is beautiful that way . besides , i 'm sure everything is ready for it . " his hand settled gently on her shoulder . " then i guess i better tell you that because even
[763/1000]	" my name is charles - " " we know , " charles cut in . " but we do n't actually listen to you , either . " it did n't matter anymore . she was n't
[764/1000]	' have time for a tea , miss <EOS> the shop - what do you think , i ' say . please do n't mind on the beach ! ' an elderly couple sat on the sand somewhere .

[766/1000]	the old girl , miss , said , ' ah , mrs. co d swal lop , ' and stepped forward , bending her head slightly to kiss magrat . she wore a dark blue , cream , le mur
[767/1000]	" for me to be honest , i thought about it . i had n't lived with anyone like i 'd lived in my new home . " she shrugs . " i was so lonely . i thought maybe
[768/1000]	her heart fluttered for an instant before fear took over . her gaze met his . " yes , i do . " but she quickly shook off the panic and the guilt as best as she could
[769/1000]	" he keeps trying to kill me , " i say . " he 's ... different than the other mo gs . " " maybe he wants you to meet him , " says kayla . "
[770/1000]	" how are things that can happen to you , exactly ? " i asked , after i remembered what the old man might say . " well , i 'm afraid i 'm just a bit of a
[771/1000]	" i know ! " matt said . he went quiet for a moment then whispered . " do you have any idea what we can use to remove the mark ? " " i 'll try , "
[772/1000]	" yeah , she probably knows who she 's getting married to and is n't making this up . " ian leaned against the front door with a frown on his face . " but for her - for everyone
[773/1000]	" i did n't really do the asking . " she smiles , like it was all part of some stupid game . " i know . i was stupid to think you would . " she takes
[774/1000]	i had n't said boo to him , but i knew there was going to be one . right now , it would seem impossible . but what i did now ... well , i could n't have it .
[775/1000]	" here are the rules , " he said into my ear . " i have to stop or my mouth will be too big . put your hand flat on the floor , no . no , but keep
[776/1000]	my lips tightened - and there we were , in trouble . a mile behind us , another truck went by . the one we were running from . i had no idea what was wrong with it , but
[777/1000]	" he 's always had an appetite in you , " he teases . " it 's actually quite lovely . " " so ... " i continue , refusing to let him see his effect on me .
[778/1000]	" well , if you change your mind , " matt said . after breakfast , matt and i had a lovely , easy conversation about his day . " so how much money do you have left ?
[779/1000]	" i 'm only surprised you 've still got a brain , " it said . " because your brain is that hard . " a moment passed . the guy seemed about to speak when the phone jerked
[780/1000]	" does it give you comfort to know that i was alive and you lost me to this ? " she whispered . " please do n't ever talk like that . never . you 've always been my

[782/1000]	one by one they all left the room : ben , who spoke russian , and elena , who had english . during all of this , elena refused to listen to a single voice . she asked so many
[783/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said again . " i 'll start all over anew , but i ca n't do it with just you . you need other people like me around . i need to get
[784/1000]	the answer did n't matter . i wanted to just roll with it and not think so much about it anymore . when i woke up , i was at my aunt 's . the door slammed behind
[785/1000]	mr. ra ab was about to complain in his low rumble . " let a son have the easy part , like all of us do . there 's no need to make this as difficult for him as
[786/1000]	" what makes you so strong ? " he does n't answer until we draw abreast and that 's when he turns to face me . he looks down at me and the look in his eyes is dark
[787/1000]	" i 'm not staying , " seth said , then moved the papers from his hand . " come on . let 's go , " he said to lauren , then started to walk , leaving his mother
[788/1000]	" it 's more than just the fact that you have his genes , " i say . " what makes you say that ? " he asks , trying to sound interested . " you look at
[789/1000]	her green eyes opened wide and she turned to face him on the pillows . he stared at her , his gaze roving over each curve of her face . and when her gaze met his , her hand rose
[790/1000]	" there are always ways around the rules . i 'll do what i want . he 's too dangerous . you know how he is . " she started for the door . " do n't come back and
[791/1000]	" if you 're to be my wife , give me one kiss , " he whispered . " really ? you 're gon na marry an assassin ? " " if it makes you happy ? "

[793/1000]	he was quiet for a time . " i 'm going to drive you upstairs , " he said at last . " i have an extra towel in the bedroom if you want one . " " no
[794/1000]	" hi , beautiful . did you get the first part figured ? " " i sure did and it 's amazing . i 've been telling him not to get his pants off . " " aww
[795/1000]	my heart felt as though it were being torn out of my chest as i looked straight up . a light breeze swept in , scattering my hair across my face . i reached out and steadied my wrist ,
[796/1000]	" i understand that , but you ca n't make this right . " " but i did n't have to make it right how ? and how were you to know ? " " i warned you
[797/1000]	" oh no . i 'm not going with you . " " i do n't think we should . " " then we 'd better start again . " " what if i take you with
[798/1000]	" who the hell is there ? " " that 's what i thought . you have got to help me . " " help you ? ! help you where ? " " with a book
[799/1000]	at last the horse - drawn coach broke out of the fog and began to move down the valley toward the river . " what are the waters of this river ? " durnik asked . " the
[800/1000]	" i do , " he agrees through a weak grin . " but that does n't mean she was guilty when she did it . " he turns to the table . " okay , as you can see
[801/1000]	you really have been worried about her . do you realize that , all along ? and the guy does have problems with women ! i mean really that , he - " " i miss the old days
[802/1000]	" how long , sweetie ? " asked mrs. slu ft to melissa 's boyfriend . " seven years " , said melissa . " what 's your favorite color ? " " color ? "
[803/1000]	" i 'll make coffee . " it did n't take long . they sat at the counter at java joint , ate a little breakfast , and went on a tour of the neighborhood . they headed to
[804/1000]	i 'd take her back anywhere right now , take her anywhere . how many f * * king times ? " i think you 'll give it a shot with me , " ty was saying to
[805/1000]	she wanted him to know that she meant the world to him . " i wish i had believed that . he is my father . " tears pricked the lids of her eyes . <EOS> ... she needed
[806/1000]	" i have to run . " he sounded winded but with a calm insistence that belied the rush of movement in his limbs . " i 'll see you later . " " what - " he
[807/1000]	the man grinned . " and now who here shares my bed , my lady ? " * he was half drunk by the time he reached her . he had no idea he was carrying her down
[808/1000]	now he was almost out of time . chapter 17 the end of day 's end was almost exactly when david had imagined . a fire in the middle of a thunderstorm . david walked to where his
[809/1000]	" let 's get in the truck and get out of here . " i put on my seatbelt , thinking about the other question i had for him . i got this strange feeling knowing i was about
[810/1000]	" i 'm glad you showed up . " just as i took that big , cheesy , cheesy bite from dessert all by myself , the doorbell rang . " i 'm coming . " i rushed
[811/1000]	" no , i thought i might enjoy this . here 's one . " he reached in his pocket and produced a small pocket knife . " do n't want you to cut yourself , if you can help
[812/1000]	" your eyes , " she started , voice soft . " they 're just different . " right now , his eyes were even more different . one blue , one green , one green . " i
[813/1000]	she could n't believe any of this . of course , now that she was free of her confinement in this place , she could help ... " lady julienne . " lucien looked straight into her eyes .
[814/1000]	he nodded . " i do n't tell her any like that , but i 've worked a lot of cases with her . for example , she 's still working on the case in which her brother was attacked
[815/1000]	it was not difficult to decipher the writing that adorned the page . " you 're doing it again , " i said . " i 'm done . " " there are no buts . "
[816/1000]	i shake my head as i swallow an apple on my way out . " get some sleep , " i tell them , not even realizing i 've been saying it for a while . it 's a lot
[817/1000]	" yes , i do , " she hissed . " that 's why i have to be fast enough not to rip you apart . get out of here . " chapter 12 " are you okay
[818/1000]	when the game was over , i left to go to the locker room to change out of my white t - shirt and blue shorts . i wondered where my lunch was . i wondered if i should call
[819/1000]	but it was hard to imagine the king was n't going to look at his nephew , <EOS> " like he 'd better get his own thoughts away from their little house out here anywhere even tried to get in
[820/1000]	i grinned , and took another bite , making a mental note to add lemon to the cupcake . once logan had made sure the blood was in my stomach , we headed downstairs to the restaurant 's main
[821/1000]	' now , why would i do that ? ' asked vern . ' you 're his friend . ' ' oh . ' ' he says you can use your stuff , so you better not
[822/1000]	before he could protest that it was all his fault , she was reaching out to him . god , he was such an idiot . how had he allowed himself to become so blind and incapable of seeing
[823/1000]	" no , please , " he sighed , rubbing his forehead . " i need to get a grip . " " you 've been a gentleman , lord griffin , " lady king air said with a
[824/1000]	i shook my head repeatedly . " no . " " you 're in love with him , are n't you ? " she said , reaching for the sheet . " do n't , " i said
[825/1000]	" his dad ? what 's he doing here ? " he stopped and held his breath and looked out into the fog that spread along the path they were descending . " are you sure you do n't
[826/1000]	" i do not love him , " said the voice , and the last thing tiffany saw before she shut her eyes was the back of a head and the doors of a hut moving away from her .
[827/1000]	" and what time is it ? " " almost eleven ... " " okay , well , we 'll pick you up at seven . " " at seven hundred hours ? " " yes
[828/1000]	" we 'll be fine , " mom said as she sat down and placed her hands on my mother 's lap and started rocking in her lap . " your mom 's right , " mom said .
[829/1000]	" why , it really is n't the right time , my dear , " she admitted with a sigh . " of course , a few of the more important issues were discussed , i assure you at the
[830/1000]	" what ? what ? " " nothing , " he said in his slightly confused tone , and as he turned to leave , i noticed the way he tucked the blanket around his waist and hid his
[831/1000]	the general turned toward the screen . " that sounds bad . what did i give you ? " " a very potent drug called o leander . " " well ? " the general pointed to the
[832/1000]	" what would you know about it ? " " i just heard it mentioned by the secretary of state , " said henry , pausing as the image of a face flashed through his eyes . the president
[833/1000]	my voice shakes . " right . i 'll check in with you soon . " i hang up . i try to process the situation , all of it . where has james gone ? how many people
[834/1000]	i saw a flash of the fire behind his eye . " i 'm talking about you . " " you 'd get a very bad reaction . " " yes , yes , i know . and
[835/1000]	please , just please let her be okay . the doctor was taking copious notes on the exam paper before he could even ask the few questions that he needed to know and then he had to get the
[836/1000]	i was in no hurry to go home , though . i needed to leave the beach for a while , before i went back to the house . i could still feel the electricity in the air from
[837/1000]	" you did n't say no when you told me about my mother , <EOS> in fact . " kate shook her head , not able to say yes . she knew that she should n't reveal a single
[838/1000]	" yes , i am , " he responded . " then as many people saw me do , i was made into the figure of the world - of the three - dimensional world - of what we
[839/1000]	the thought of a repeat was almost too much . with his mind muddled with his jumbled emotions , his body turned to lead and he fell headlong into the darkness . * * * * * the
[840/1000]	he picked at his food and tried to do her bidding . but he 'd been wrong about that . still <EOS> and what it seemed to hurt until she knew the way she made her hair .
[841/1000]	they 're about two feet from the edge when i start to hit his shoulder . he jerks , his hand flying forward , taking off from my pocket with one hand , his finger gripping the trigger of
[842/1000]	a sharp cry came from outside , and she jumped up , her eyes wide and staring . " the door 's locked ! go before you die ! " but he shoved his way past her and fled
[843/1000]	" we do n't have to do this ! " i stood up . " the hell we n't ! " " you do n't have to do anything . " he slid a finger down my cheek .
[844/1000]	" where 's your key ? i would n't have any trouble getting in . " beth smiled , and her eyes crinkled a little in a mischievous little smile . " that would be good . "
[845/1000]	there was nothing . there was only - the empty walls . no sounds , not through the cracks and vents or under the closed doors . he tried to move , to stand , but could n't . the
[846/1000]	" he said : ' i 'm a fool . ' " she nodded . " and do you know that some men who write to me about their troubles do n't say they are a fool , or
[847/1000]	he heard a thump and looked back under his chair . the thing was gone . the girl was still sleeping . nick swallowed hard and made his way home . just as he reached the door ,
[848/1000]	" would n't it be a beautiful time to have the baby ? " " what about it ? " she said . " we should see the baby a little before the wedding for a while . "
[849/1000]	" i am not the emperor of this world ! " the woman protested . " we seek only justice in all its things . our kingdom is not as far from all others as we could hope for .
[850/1000]	all things considered , that whole thing was a crazy coincidence and not like she had found a key to her father 's house to leave them to . but she wanted to figure all this out and meet daniel
[851/1000]	i started to feel like i was supposed to be in charge of this matter . where are my instincts ? it should 've come to me knowing my daughter would be able to handle this part of the mission
[852/1000]	the man stood over the table , dressed in the official garb of the navy , which had evidently been re scin ded the previous summer by the captain , and handed him the watch . the captain looked up
[853/1000]	he moved within a yard near me and leaned over my shoulder , his breath on my neck . " how many times tell me you forgive me ? " one more step and i 'd have reached the
[854/1000]	what was wrong with her ? she was a pretty , polite woman . she should not be lying to him about how well she did on saturdays , especially not this morning when his brother would be here to
[855/1000]	" that might cover the issue . it 's about saving lives . " " good idea . " " by the way , i know one of the players here . i had time to come down
[856/1000]	" so where does that leave us ? " the boy answered , choosing his words carefully and with a deliberate pause of voice . " we are stuck in the maze ! " even with the new knowledge
[857/1000]	" i 'm flattered , " emily said stiffly . the only response she could give was a feeble nod . they continued back down the hall . a long , pale light in the corridor made it difficult to
[858/1000]	" i 've never trusted anyone with such a thing , " she said dryly . and i know you never will , i thought . you do n't have a right to ask me that . he held
[859/1000]	and finally , the day finally came when ... the fire came that night . there was nothing left of the church , save a pile of charred sticks and a patch of rotten leaves where the front
[860/1000]	she was nervous now , for now . she looked away from him and he saw the guilt in her eyes . " what should i do ? " " sit alone with me for that talk , "
[861/1000]	but , it was still the wolf who could still die . instead , she took off the gloves . " i can call around now . " and i know where these wolves are . she had to
[862/1000]	but how could things have gone so wrong so quickly ? was there any way she could have prevented it ? should she have let him continue to love her ? why had n't she taken the opportunity to be
[863/1000]	" i ca n't , " she said . " but i 'm so sorry ! " he cried . she looked over at him , then through the windows that lined her cabin . she saw him
[864/1000]	i leaned toward her and sighed softly . " please do as i say , " i told her , squeezing her hands . i knew she would do it for me . so it 's best for her
[865/1000]	" you 're gon na get a hi ckey . you need to get a hi ckey . " " oh yeah ? and here you thought i could n't have a hi ckey . " " you
[866/1000]	" i do , actually . i will . " " good . " and that 's when all conversation was lost . it sounds like i asked to be a professional , i 'm sure . and
[867/1000]	" do not , " said the king , smiling at her . " come over here , victoria . i will show you how i am meant to look at the queen of england , and you can see
[868/1000]	his hands slid to the back of her head and guided her to his mouth . she heard him growl against her lips but that did n't give her a chance to breathe . her hands slid around his
[869/1000]	she 's not here , i repeat to myself over and over again and again . please god , no . as the days grow longer , i try to wrap my head around what 's happening .
[870/1000]	she leaned over and kissed me on the mouth . in a quiet , sweet voice , she said , " i 've got some things i wanna do to you , too . " fifteen i was
[871/1000]	" why would he kill someone i do n't know ? " she whimpered , her stomach roiling . " i wish it was me who killed his son ! " " he does n't have a son ,
[872/1000]	he did n't . he leaned his head back . " i love you , too . " " i want to tell you something . " then she smiled sadly . " now i 'm sick to death
[873/1000]	" ' course ! " he replied . " i 'm always telling myself that you 're the best of the best ! " his eyes were still downcast . i tried not to laugh at that .
[874/1000]	" and how are your feelings towards me ? " his answer ? he laughed . " are you kidding ? i 've always been drawn to you . " " for your reputation , i hope .
[875/1000]	" sure . " <EOS> ... " yes ... and then what happened to me . it had n't been long , and nothing . maybe he knew that i knew something like that too . but ... the
[876/1000]	" did my parents make you look like a fool ? " he barked at her . " i should have taken her away from them both . i should have made the choice myself . " in the
[877/1000]	" hey , i 'm sorry , i had no idea ! it 's really so crazy that some guys in town have it on with the private investigating agency ! i really do n't know why ! " i
[878/1000]	" what is it , mom ? " i went to her chair , " are you all right ? " " yes . i 'm fine . i am a little tired , not quite ready to tell
[879/1000]	jake turned to me with narrowed eyes and asked , " why ? " " it 's important that we 're talking , " i announced . " then we should take it where we 're gon na
[880/1000]	" but i think - " " do n't think , " he whispered , his cheeks flushed . " think long and hard about it . " she hesitated again on the bottom step , gazing up
[881/1000]	" it was a lucky shot , " she said . she set her cup down gently , looking a bit confused . " i had n't hit all that head - on through a windshield . " "
[882/1000]	the man seemed pleased with an admission of guilt . he tapped his lips with a long index finger . " in this case , i think to preserve my own sanity , i would appreciate your kind assistance
[883/1000]	" it 's fine . i just would have liked to see if any of your mother 's plants were still growing . " he pulled a bottle of water from his cabinet and sat down across from my plate
[884/1000]	and just like that i had everything . more questions than answers , more questions than answers . <EOS> and we drove along the path like hell , waiting to follow my mistakes and the little ones we could barely
[885/1000]	" no . " i turned , and he was standing on the doorway , looking down on me with his bright chocolate eyes . i knew that look - he would do anything for me . and it
[886/1000]	some of that blood still oozing from her cheek . " if you die , i stop feeding . let me do what i know is right . i 'll hunt them , " he told her . " and
[887/1000]	" i do n't tell anyone . " " do i tell anyone ? " " i would pretend not to know a soul . " they walked to a dark corner where it was quieter .
[888/1000]	" yeah , he said it was pretty basic . i do n't know much about these things , but there had to be some training work to make this work . " " no , " i said
[889/1000]	" you 're not the only one with too much to drink , love . " " no alcohol , " she said . " you want me to call security ? " the bartender asked .
[890/1000]	* * * the next morning i tried to eat , but i could n't move my legs enough to do it . the thought of food made me queasy . i still had n't fed my brother
[891/1000]	he could feel her trembling . a strange hunger rushed through him , a hunger that would not be denied this night . moving from the couch he moved into the hall , only to pause as he realized
[892/1000]	" yes , in every sense really , with all that 's wrong with you . but you were a grown woman , you were in charge here even before you got it all figured out . why would you
[893/1000]	" i did n't know when i got here that the whole apartment was going to be trashed . " " we all did . mom 's looking into it . " " i know . i 'm
[894/1000]	he did n't give her a chance to respond , lifting her into his arms and laying her across the bed on her back . he went straight to her shoes , yanked them off , did the same
[895/1000]	" you think i care ? " asked gregor . " i do n't know , " said ares , and flew in a low cut up to the ledge . gregor realized at that moment that being
[896/1000]	" then , i demand that you leave me . " * * * * so that part was done . good . " um , why am i here , jacob ? " " you
[897/1000]	" i 'll be there , " i said . " you can drive first . " " but ... " there was surprise in her voice . not that i was surprised . i 'd seen what
[898/1000]	" you can find anything over all the other obstacles . " " not this time . " she leaned forward for another kiss . " we can have a good time , " she whispered against his
[899/1000]	" but i was in danger ... all i need does is to get in there and then put my foot in just long enough to get ' round another circle . " " i do n't plan on
[900/1000]	" see ? it 's not as simple as that , " she assured him with a wink . " but the girls are better than they look . now , let me pay for all of this , do
[901/1000]	" but someone attacked me because of you , and i found out i had to hurt you , and it just sort of happened , and that it would n't stop . " she 's saying that all the
[902/1000]	tom laughed . his eyes seemed to shine , white against the black of the night . " yes , my heart was pounding . my lord , i was afraid you had made one of your traps and we
[903/1000]	he shrugged his shoulders and turned back to the computer , typing . " i 'm not so sure , " i replied . " we have someone you know - or at least know of . a girl
[904/1000]	" i 'm not talking to you . " " i 'm not talking to myself , either . i may not have a brain but i 've got a sense of smell when it comes to this stuff
[905/1000]	" all right , " the witch said . " but i will not be held in suspense anymore . if you will not share your tale of woe , you will tell me more yourself . " his
[906/1000]	" can you come inside for a minute ? " she asks . i reach for the door . but she stops me before i can knock . " no , " she says . " do n't
[907/1000]	" do n't cry , " said gregor . " i promise you that i will take care of you and your mother . " " but ... but ... just how will it play out ? " it
[908/1000]	" i ca n't do this . " " do what ? " he asked , his shoulders slumping . " i have no clue if i 've succeeded in finding the star or not , but it
[909/1000]	" yes , " she sobbed . " i do n't know how ... how much . i swear to god i will never tell anyone . " i did n't know why she used to make that quote ,
[910/1000]	" that 's it , " george finally says , and gets up off the floor . " that 's it . that 's it . just ... get to your bed . i told you i 'd take care
[911/1000]	" oh , yeah , " <EOS> really wanting it just <EOS> the part i hoped i could take over myself in my mind . my legs were already twitching and my hand was stroking my jaw , not really
[912/1000]	he bent more and rested his head on her hip . " have the night terrors gone ? " " no . i lost my memory . " he released her , as if just getting through the day
[913/1000]	" sorry .... oh no . i 'm ... uh ... i'm really sorry ... i 'm out of it , " he stammered , now looking ashamed . " no problem , " said brian . " why
[914/1000]	" i hope you feel better soon , mr. brown . otherwise i take full responsibility for this trip and need to be somewhere fast . " " yes , i have a truck coming to pick me up
[915/1000]	the first time he saw the three girls together , they both looked very happy , in love . i had always thought them very small , but the girl was like a woman , the girl ... the girl
[916/1000]	" it was a quick draw . i can tell it was a big draw . the guy got her number and he called to see if she was on her way to class . she hung up on him
[917/1000]	" so we 're not ready ? " he asked with a frown . " no . " " are my brothers ready ? that 's what you want just because i have a family as well as
[918/1000]	" let 's go for a walk . " she frowned . " just trust me , cara . i did it for you . " " oh , it 's nothing . no big deal .
[919/1000]	" i 'm not doing that . the people he chooses are very sick already . he has obligations , and it would be a very bad idea . " " how about if i let you know why
[920/1000]	" please , " she whispered , clutching at her stomach . then she jerked against him as if she felt the knife in his abdomen . he was afraid to respond ; he was n't sure he could
[921/1000]	" hi , ladies , " she greeted . the group turned to her , and by some small miracle , she did n't stumble in her clum siness . " well , i know you 're all staring ,
[922/1000]	" i 'm glad i could help because the thing is , it 's ... " " really ? " i was n't . she raised her eyebrows questioningly and then shrugged <EOS> ' just a small bit
[923/1000]	" right , okay . " " he would go with me . " " he has n't said a word about this . " " will he stay with me ? " " no .
[924/1000]	" where are you going ? " he asked . " to check on her . if she 's still breathing , i hope she was in excellent hands . " aidan chuckled as he walked out the
[925/1000]	" my mom 's got a job as a nurse . after graduation there 's a job teaching at the hospital . we worked the summer shift and she was able to find a job at the local diner .
[926/1000]	she felt the last few drops of blood flow from her face . " do n't worry , " he said , taking his attention off her . " let me help you get to your feet . "
[927/1000]	" there 's no need to get all snappy . i know you 're going to like this . " she had no idea her mom was going to make her do anything , but her mom was n't
[928/1000]	' i told him to come and go as he liked , but if he could n't , he could go out and come back - the other way around . no disrespect to your precious wife , my lord
[929/1000]	he pulled out a folded envelope but instead of handing it to her he said , " this is for you , miss black . " " i see you 're the one that saved those pictures of me
[930/1000]	she shook her head . " let 's do this . " " i just do n't want you getting hurt . what if something happens to us ? " " oh , you know how it is
[931/1000]	' or you can go live in the mountains . whatever you 'll choose . ' she paused . ' i 'm afraid i ca n't accept that . ' ' do n't be afraid - '
[932/1000]	" yes , " i lied . " tell me , " max commanded as i walked to the desk . he stopped me by sweeping one arm around me and pulling me against him . " i
[933/1000]	" i am willing to try and make it work . " they stayed in no immediate danger of being separated . in fact , many of the men made it to high school before being abducted and tied
[934/1000]	" i ... like them , " she said unsteadily . " good girl , " he said . " that 's how she wants it . " " what are you going to do , mom ?
[935/1000]	" and you know this why ? " " because that 's as good as i can get . " " look , man , i do n't want to talk to you . " " i
[936/1000]	the room was nearly small enough for two people and she perched it up against a cabinet . he paused and pulled out a chair , sitting down , folding his long legs close to the couch , folding his
[937/1000]	" do you want me to stay with you guys ? " " who knows , " jared replies without looking back at me . jared closes the door . - 3 - " the place
[938/1000]	" thanks . " he smiled back . " how 's your dad ? " " he was looking for a place , but only got <EOS> ... " i trailed off . " he 's scared . "
[939/1000]	they both burst out laughing . chapter 14 the following morning the smell of stale coffee filled the office . a cloud of cigarette smoke billowed above each of the lawyers and secretaries sitting around the small round
[940/1000]	" what , with the other , more ? " " i do n't know . " " well , not with any of us , i suppose . " <EOS> - looking and the girls were all
[941/1000]	" no , " i said , " i did n't plan it . i just ... i had a rough night and i need some peace . " and then i felt a twinge of guilt . it
[942/1000]	" and i 'm sure you have all of these items in the box and you would n't do anything all day at work ? ' asked the clerk . " no , i am happy to do that
[943/1000]	" no , " clary said . " he did n't . he did n't hurt anyone ; he went to live with you . he did n't ... in a way . he just wanted you to understand someone
[944/1000]	" let me tell you , " she said hurriedly , turning , but not so quickly he actually heard her . " he left me breathless , but i felt good . and then he did something so fantastic
[945/1000]	chapter 20 the next morning the light was dim , the sun almost coming up . the morning was cooler than usually , but the temperature felt fine . as he stood in the shadow of the building a
[946/1000]	i stood with my face frozen and looked away . " do you hate me now ? " he asked . i shook my head , feeling the tears sting my eyes . " no , " i
[947/1000]	" i know and i know . i 'll try it . " i 'm afraid to see his expression . his expression is frozen in a mask of disgust . " sure , " he says like i
[948/1000]	all the time i was running . i needed to get to the airport before it closed . if my father found out , he would probably murder me . and that would make things go south altogether .
[949/1000]	alex felt the air , through the link , that shimmered slightly at this touch . " hey , " he said . " do you know where i am ? " " do you mean the middle
[950/1000]	i watched , lost in the quiet beauty of the landscape . my mouth tingled as the scent of winter lingered in the air . i glanced across at the house , thinking of her father . he
[951/1000]	it 's over . over . for now . but he knows , he 's been thinking this for years . the dream 's coming . it 's coming . he knew it as soon as he woke
[952/1000]	then she 'd gotten up and fled to the stables and stayed there all day . and her cell phone had been ringing all day last night . she was tired . more relaxed than she 'd been
[953/1000]	the rest we have decided . a mission to become free of the curse . it 's much more complicated than that . so on the very first day of my eighth birthday , i pick the most
[954/1000]	" at least it was meant for him as a means of transport . if they had n't found the package and that was the last time you and i saw each other again ... " " you know
[955/1000]	" it 's for the last few years . i want to see both their minds at the same time , " i said as i pushed to my feet . " i bet . i 'm sure he
[956/1000]	" stop . it will destroy me if i 'm not careful . " " you mean , kill you ? " she asked hopefully . " yes , that as well . i 'd let death do
[957/1000]	" not sure why i should be going there after what happened yesterday , " he said , trying to smile as in imitation of the voice he normally used at work . " sorry . " " it
[958/1000]	he looked at her helplessly . " i 'm sorry , baby . i 'm so sorry . " " no , it was n't your fault . it was mine . i need that drink , christian .
[959/1000]	was n't it interesting when you held out the baby grand , the baby grand that had been destroyed by an earthquake ? everyone knew when you held off any information the universe had in store for you . the
[960/1000]	the first rays of light began to seep through the drapes . he was lying on the leather sofa in ian 's sitting room , staring out the windows across the long courtyard of glass . his back was
[961/1000]	" do you understand ? " the man pleaded . " i do n't have answers for you . i ca n't ! " " what did you say ? you broke into the embassy ! " bourne gripped
[962/1000]	" then you heard right . " " good , i 'm glad . " " it 's this way , " he said gesturing down the hallway . as he followed the yellow police tape marking the
[963/1000]	" do n't worry . i wo n't tell on you . " " does n't matter , " beth said . " he told me he was going to try to find some answers . all he had
[964/1000]	" you did , " said a quiet voice behind her . she jerked around . a tall , round man stood in the doorway , leaning casually against the frame . he looked like himself , if slightly
[965/1000]	" she 's my sister . my sister is missing . " a shadow passes across andrew 's face . " what do you mean , she 's missing ? " his tone is low but unwavering .
[966/1000]	" be still my heart , o wise one . " he bowed with his head and drew back <EOS> my hands , and then his mouth was at my breast , licking the tight points . and there was
[967/1000]	" the only person i do n't like . " she smiled , but not in a pleased way . " he 's quite possessive of you . " " so they say . " her lips
[968/1000]	" is that the best you can do ? " i ask , stepping around the front of the car to stand in front of her . " why not ? how much did you want to know ?
[969/1000]	" he 's doing a hundred ninety . " alex shrugged his shoulders . " come on , let 's get drunk . " he started to walk toward the entrance . " but i still have to do
[970/1000]	" do they do that ? " i ask , still in the throes of shock . this does n't seem real to me . it certainly did not happen right after the funeral . " oh , yeah
[971/1000]	" i 'm sorry , man . " jake came up beside him . " what were we doing ? you 're the one who said she was a bad time . " " i know that , "
[972/1000]	his parents , you 've got to be kidding me . i was only seven when he left . i looked at him . " nothing happened . " " in case the damage . they told me
[973/1000]	* this is the end of this and as i write this , there is a moment of total silence , like as if your dad is dead , or so the saying goes . it is like nothing
[974/1000]	he shrugged and then grinned . " i guess . " how could she think he was playing dirty ? " i 've been meaning to get it , " she said quickly . " the one thing
[975/1000]	he dropped into that chair again , looking up at the face of a young woman watching from the window . the woman had graying straight brown hair , brown eyes . " i would like you to meet
[976/1000]	" me too . " * * * " i do n't think that you have to worry so much . i do mind , " she says . i shrug . " does n't matter .
[977/1000]	" yeah , " i respond , letting him steer me out of the car . " we will be at the hospital now , " he tells me , his eyes twinkling as he scans my scrubs .
[978/1000]	" how awful ; they say that you are not sure if you 're going to make it . " " you must really wish i was still alive , " i replied with a smile , wondering how
[979/1000]	" it wo n't happen , " said shadow . " no one would do any of that to someone they just met . they 'd have told someone . " there was a long . strange silence .
[980/1000]	" you say he killed himself , " she murmured . it was as if the world changed . " yes . " " will he be all right ? " " no . " that did
[981/1000]	and then i was doing something most women would not expect or expect from a woman when they ask for something . i was going to ask if she 's a good girl to marry . to be faithful .
[982/1000]	" but i made him up ! my aunt ca n't find out ! " " you made me up ! " i gave a sharp nod . " was he nice ? " " he 's not
[983/1000]	" i 'm a bad kisser , " i say with a grin that only makes my mouth hurt worse . he glances at me . " i 'd like to see you make that . " "
[984/1000]	" you must tell the king . i must call everyone together . as soon as the king hears this he will be prepared by the men of the throne . " " what do you think he will
[985/1000]	" i ca n't let anyone know i was there . if they start searching , i 'll be spotted . " " did you find her bedroom ? " " there 's the bedroom . "
[986/1000]	without a second thought , the man raised a hand and pointed to a large crack in the middle of the wall in the east , at the same time he pointed in the opposite direction from where he stood
[987/1000]	this evening , she had a glass of wine in the house for the man who 'd just left it , then left on his horse . his uncle , the earl , and lord and lady chad wick would
[988/1000]	everyone sat down on the bed . several others nodded their heads . one boy drew his thumb across his throat and spoke the words <EOS> a low - the day so low , but otherwise , he only looked
[989/1000]	" you have the keys to the plane ? " he asked when she was gone . " no . but i know people in new york . they 'll recognize the plane . everyone in new york knows
[990/1000]	" not a lot of time . " the cell phone on the table slipped by meredith with barely a sound , and she picked it up . " hello ? " " hey , kid . i
[991/1000]	" yes , but we ca n't take it out of the bag , and you already wore it when we were arguing about it . " " okay , " he said . he looked a little uncomfortable
[992/1000]	" so what 's the latest ? " " well ... wait ... what , yes , the one we just talked about . we are in a war , or at least as close to one as is
[993/1000]	" no real effort at all , " he said with a grin . he slid his hand up under her shirt , sliding his fingers over her stomach while he drew her closer . " no , there
[994/1000]	' what are you trying to do ? ' ' i 'm trying to keep your daughter from getting hurt and making the bigger picture bigger . ' he stared at her for a long time , and
[995/1000]	mr. hayes took several steps forward . " ok , where exactly in the world does this exit lead ? " tracy turned to look back down the hallway she headed down a short ways and said , "
[996/1000]	i opened my eyes , and instantly i saw what had caught my eye . the little white ball sat on the edge of the bed ; i guess i needed to go see it . i could n't
[997/1000]	i glanced away shame faced . " the pain from the burn from this is excruciating . i 'm just here to see you as soon as i can - " i made it to my knees when
[998/1000]	i smiled and shook my head in disbelief . " you got to be kidding me . " i shouted to her . " you do n't put up with this crap ! you just keep saying what you 're
[999/1000]	" oh , this is just great . let me go get julie and change my stuff . " julie raced inside her office . " i 'll meet you up there . " the girl had never been in
