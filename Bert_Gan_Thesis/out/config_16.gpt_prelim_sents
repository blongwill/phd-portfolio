[3/1000]	" that 's one way i can set that one , " joe said . he was halfway back to the car when the sound of a car engine floated across the high - school er lawn with the
[4/1000]	the thought that he was planning something did n't sit right with her , and she hoped his plan for that involved torture rather than a man - to - man interrogation . but she 'd ask his cooperation for
[5/1000]	" okay , so what do you make of her ? " he asked as he pulled me away from the window . " honestly , connor and i were completely out of sync about everything . " i
[6/1000]	" where ? " " at our place . " his stomach hurt . all he 'd wanted was to go home , to think about eve smiling at him as he held her in his arms .
[7/1000]	" did your mother say anything to you ? " " no . i was n't supposed to see her , but my sister was always talking about how much i missed my family . it made me start
[8/1000]	david took the last bite of his breakfast . then he pushed the plate away with his knife . " this is n't my first food here but my friend 's not always like this . " " he
[9/1000]	" what ? " i ask . " i do n't know all the names or details , but it 's me . " " no , you 're not . " my voice is quiet , but
[10/1000]	" <EOS> we 'll take the bodies back into town - but they say everyone has n't seen them all day . in a few hours , they 'll hit the main roads , " john said . "
[11/1000]	" what i meant is , it changes everything . if it were me , would n't i know ? would n't i do anything i could to keep it from happening to you ? " that was because
[12/1000]	" well , your father 's just dead , " said clarence . his chest grew heavy and he began to tremble . clarence noticed the pale face , swollen mouth and bloodshot eyes and gave him a questioning look
[13/1000]	" hey , " he said hoarsely , touching his forehead to mine . " i want to kiss you so much . " he held me there for too long , his fingers clutching my waist as he
[14/1000]	she had n't recognized him . there was nothing special about this man . " i 'm sorry ? " she asked , suddenly not sure how to respond to that . " i apologize . i promised
[15/1000]	to see these five children in his mind became a dream so intense that he could barely understand it . then time seemed to slow , and how often , he could be certain he did not actually see the
[16/1000]	she continued to smile . " i love you as well . " she tilted up her chin slightly , her head tilted as well to get closer to him . it was then that she saw his eyes flash
[17/1000]	the people in the room were like tiny living creatures clinging to each other in pain . " i did n't mean anything by it , " the man whispered . the woman continued to cry . "
[18/1000]	" oh , that 's the other new thing about you . you got a kid who does n't like kids anymore . you like kids more and more lately ... " " ugh , i do n't want
[19/1000]	" of course we 'll show them . you know they 'll be expecting you . " " oh , how awful ! well , i may need your help , " she admitted hesitantly . " i 'm
[20/1000]	" i could run an arm over you or a leg through your back , " i said , keeping my voice light and confident . his gaze found mine , his eyes looking past my shoulder to somewhere
[21/1000]	she pushed from her chair . he shot to his feet and intercepted her . " whoa , baby . i was just kidding . " she smirked into his eyes . " right , you were n't
[22/1000]	" i could do with some fresh air and solitude . " " i 'm afraid you do n't have a choice . " " but i do have a choice ! " he saw her eyes
[23/1000]	<EOS> he stopped in silence , and they both knew . " my gut ! " he said and looked at her . " or have i come back to change everything ? " he added , her answering
[24/1000]	" he did n't drink ! " ellie protested , a tiny squeak reaching her ears . " he drank a drink . and i did n't see him drinking any alcohol today . " ellie walked over to the
[25/1000]	they had come over here for her birthday and were eager to ask her about their plans " for her birthday " and , so far , all grant had told her about was the kids and how much they
[26/1000]	" oh , come on . we are like you , right ? good for each other . right ? besides , i had a feeling i would see you pretty soon . your mom gets to you so fast
[27/1000]	" who ? " " i mean her sister . " " how ? " " i do n't know . it 's long or short . " " can i give you anything ? i
[28/1000]	" if we 're going to do this , we should probably do it together , " ashe had to shout . " we 'll be a team . we 'll be able to work out and play for the
[29/1000]	" maybe , and maybe he 's playing me all along . " she pauses , then turns to me , " tell me that is n't true ! " i shrug , uncomfortable with the conversation . "
[30/1000]	a long moment stretched between them . " i ca n't - " he broke off with a choked cry . his fingers dug into her waist , a warning . the elevator door opened , and cassie and
[31/1000]	" that 's the first time you 've said that to me , " he told her , one eyebrow raised , a trace of disbelief in his gray eyes . " is it really possible you 're worried what
[32/1000]	not exactly good news for an un charitable person . " i 'm a private detective . a real good one , too . i think you 'll find you have a beautiful man to love . " probably did
[33/1000]	" so this is the infamous brandon fletcher ? " ryan asked . " did miss daniels ever tell you she dated brandon fletcher all the way to school ? " my friends all gave him long looks . "
[34/1000]	" very true , my lord , " said the eunuch . " they would have only one , lord o bara will have only one . what is left from that ? " " a few birds .
[35/1000]	he nodded emphatically . " how many of them have you killed ? " that was a tough question to answer . " twenty or thirty , it varies in range . these are not children . we
[36/1000]	" yeah of course i know , can you blame me ? after all , i 'm the one at fault here . " " well tell me about it , man . " i finished my beer
[37/1000]	" are you okay , baby ? " he asked , his voice sounding a little tight . " i 'm sorry if i hurt you . " her head was a blur . her heart was a very
[38/1000]	to her chagrin , his lack of an answer made her smile . " i was only teasing , " she admitted . " then you are an excellent liar . " she nodded sagely . "
[39/1000]	" wow , thanks for all the help . " " what was she doing ? " " getting out a newspaper . " " how did she do it ? " " what reporter ?
[40/1000]	then , as though nothing untoward happened , everyone began dropping out of other people 's lives to spend the rest of their days at home . a quiet voice in my head said i ought to do the same
[41/1000]	" why ? " she was holding a mirror in her hand - she 'd dropped the one she 'd been holding and her fingers were shaking . i grabbed her wrist , and she looked down at our
[42/1000]	" but you 'll do it , wo n't you ? " she asked . " i have to , " he said . she felt her arms slip around him and she shivered at the contact .
[43/1000]	" i 'll get the bag and meet the boys , " david said . he went back down the empty hallway and down the stairs . " mom . " a whisper , it was a broken whisper
[44/1000]	" tell me what the damage is . " " the damage is on the other side of the windshield . " " why ? " he frowned . " tell me now . " " you
[45/1000]	" you 're out late , baby . " and still , she did n't stop me . she did n't even appear to feel like she did . it was like she was talking to herself -
[46/1000]	" uh huh , " she admitted . with that , he began stalking toward the porch , letting her carry the grocery bag . her hair was in a ponytail and she 'd donned a plain white button
[47/1000]	chapter 32 two <EOS> before finding a possible connection - to find out how she is more and more . " i knew where my head was . the one thing she had n't taken with her .
[48/1000]	" yes , well i was actually just wanting to tell you that the kids from here are going camping this weekend . please , i will get my phone back this morning . " he paused , then
[49/1000]	" my parents bought a plane at lax . i 'd like to hear about it . " " it 's a luxury . " " and what do you do on it ? " he looked
[50/1000]	i take a deep breath , forcing my nerves to calm . " he 's there for my safety , " i say , trying to shake it off . " i really thought about going back to school ,
[51/1000]	' what about just an old lady ? ' i asked . ' old lady ? ' i replied , confused . ' the black lady i 'm sure is lurking in the cellar somewhere , ' she
[52/1000]	" it 's the police . the police are coming up . they 're going to come and take over the city gates in a few hours . " " oh no ! they wo n't do that .
[53/1000]	he looked a little concerned but then he cleared his throat gruffly . " i do n't know if we are going to know much about her before we get to her and get to her family . "
[54/1000]	he was n't sure how he was supposed to explain his actions when his family felt responsible for his crimes to the two other lords . " you and i do n't know each other . " she shrugged
[55/1000]	" yeah , " said chello . " sorry . " " none of us really is , " said nevi quietly . " we were just talking about what 's back at the entrance . " "
[56/1000]	i frowned and stared at her oddly . " what do you want me to do ? " " i would appreciate it , " she started . " if i could give you an idea of a way
[57/1000]	the boy was n't a very good listener . and if david was ever going to pick up a book about ... the ... not - quite true ? not her . instead she called a cab and said
[58/1000]	" and we might have to hide out for a while until he had gotten over the sadness . we ca n't leave any evidence . " " but any police authorities might see it . " "
[59/1000]	" right . " he stood and left the room leaving her alone in her own head . she watched , but did n't feel up to talking . instead , she curled up on the opposite wall than
[60/1000]	" ah , yes , the man in question , the one you met when you were attacked by those savages in the ravine . " the thought of what they had seen could still make rema 's head
[61/1000]	" my name is - " " mrs. everett - may i call you beth ? and i think i want to make contact with - " and then he realized that he forgot his manners after all
[62/1000]	the man had tried to kill her . maybe he 'd been waiting for her to see who it was . but it was n't her , it was n't his . her throat locked at the
[63/1000]	" nothing from the hospital . " he ignored her . " i just got off the phone with the director of admissions . " he folded his arms across his chest and leaned against the doorframe . "
[64/1000]	" what does that mean ? " " it means the answer to the riddle is no . " " what does that mean ? " " i have some of the answers , " says mr.
[65/1000]	" i could have hurt you , " i say . he lets my hand go . just like that . does n't say a single word after that . does n't ask me what i mean . does
[66/1000]	" okay , " he said with a slightly breathy tone in his voice . " is that the last of it ? " " you got it . " " good , " i said ,
[67/1000]	" go inside , " i tell them . " i 'll be there in a minute . " i glance at my mother , her eyes are shut . " go to bed . we 'll talk about this
[68/1000]	on occasion a visit of the king 's court would be good for the spirits to sing aloud about something . a word of guidance from the king would suffice . but for now , the only person he
[69/1000]	" ah , thank you . " she smiled , her dark eyes glinting . he followed her gaze to the tray . his gaze skimmed over all the fresh fruits and vegetables . the silver cup
[70/1000]	" not here . here ? no way . i 'm <EOS> ' over there ' and you 'd have you . " that was her sister just , the daughter of the wealthiest businessman in the country , the
[71/1000]	she started for the door . " i 'll go , " he said , looking at the two men standing together still . " my apologies . i must go . " the other man took his arm
[72/1000]	" what ? " i heard him say above me . i nodded vigorously . " right here in front of you , " i said in a hoarse whisper . he pulled me closer to him ,
[73/1000]	" who 's that ? " katie asked . " you would be smart to listen to her when she 's stressed to the point of hyperventi lation , " i said , smiling to myself . i
[74/1000]	* * * " this is it , " said steve . the fire alarm had gone off for just a few minutes and now there was a steady wailing sound . he peered into the tent .
[75/1000]	i blinked . for a moment i thought she was n't speaking in russian . but with the volume of the music blasting , i could even have heard her . " you 're not calling me ? " i
[76/1000]	" no , " i say , a little worried but mostly happy to be getting my life back on track . " i 'm doing good . thank you for meeting me again . " " you 're
[77/1000]	then i looked into his eyes , closed them in appreciation , and whispered , " so you know my life was quiet , pretty , kind , entertaining and exciting ? " he was silent but he did
[78/1000]	" hi , mr. mercer , " i said , my heart squeezing . " what is it ? " mrs. mercer did n't say anything for a long moment , and i wondered if she was trying to
[79/1000]	" how 's it going ? " " she 's as good as she 'll ever be . you should n't do this . " " do what ? " mike 's curiosity was piqued . he understood
[80/1000]	he looked back at the road , and then back at me . " i 'll protect you , " he said . " i do n't want you to protect me , " i said . he
[81/1000]	i tried not to stare at the gun . that - and the look on his face . it was very real . what was he trying to do ? give it against me ? or did he do
[82/1000]	" i can pay . " " i ca n't . i can pay you nothing . " i started to walk away from him . " hold out your hand , the payment is on me .
[83/1000]	" my wife , i ... i love her . " a muscle in his jaw twitched , then vanished . he turned back to the window , taking out the whiskey and a fresh bottle of whisky .
[84/1000]	" and you think that means people are going to start hating him again on the morning he dies ? " alex nodded . " we 'll just need to wait and see who 's going to die
[85/1000]	" are you going to wait here for another while ? " she asked . i looked down at the car . " no , i 'm on my way back . " i pulled up to the
[86/1000]	not one hundred percent sure " some days " is true . that 's what he thinks . i hope i never have to find out the truth about that . if i do n't get the truth from him
[87/1000]	i followed my senses forward with a wave of revulsion while my stomach protested at the sight . my hands landed on the cold metal of the counter . i flinched and pulled back . maybe i was drunk ,
[88/1000]	maybe , but i was here , and he was watching me . i was n't exactly sure where that left us . we had something in common . we both had a child . but what i felt for
[89/1000]	i looked at her with open - mouthed wonder and that 's when i felt the burn of tears in my eyes . i did n't cry . i told her who i was . i told her everything if
[90/1000]	" i do n't understand , " she said , though this time there was still a trace of bitterness . she hated that they were in this situation and the question of why so much hurt her was what
[91/1000]	" you 're right , " sam admits . " and yeah , every guy here has more or less the same problem . what good are we if we ca n't play cards ? " " i can
[92/1000]	" do you know what this means ? " " it means i 'm still a wolf . " he shrugged . " and i do n't like the answer to that . " i swallowed bile .
[93/1000]	his mother was about to tell her ' no ' when she saw the white marble statues . and then something struck her and she gasped and clutched her chest . " hello , " the cat said and
[94/1000]	" i 'm fine ! just a headache . " " your name , is the name of the man you were interviewing yesterday ? " oh , good - he made it sound like he was only
[95/1000]	chapter 3 a half hour later they circled . in the distance , just behind a small rise , was the small , single - story , red brick farm house belonging to the family of douglas and ma
[96/1000]	i frowned at the thought . why did i care so much that he was attracted to me beyond friendship ? i could be friends with a supermodel , for crying out loud . what was wrong with me ?
[97/1000]	" let 's get out of here . " we walked through the gates and into the cool night air . i let the tension flow out of me . why does everything still feel so real when every
[98/1000]	" you mean - " " i 'm a human . i believe that if a human looks into those eyes , her human heart will be found , and she will become very , very happy , because
[99/1000]	" and his work was . how is he ? " " he 's a good man . he wo n't give up , and one day he 's going to make the biggest mistake of his life .
[100/1000]	i could have come home . could have left you there with her , the whole time , without a care in the world . i could have saved you . i could have chosen every action i could have
[101/1000]	he 'd always known he was special if he could have been what she 'd seen in him ; and the thought of not having had this - this unending sense of happiness and belonging - for so very long
[102/1000]	her whole body froze . her mouth dropped open in confusion . he said , " when you come out of the bathroom , you think the doorknob twisted and you got out . like you knew that and
[103/1000]	" who 's the lucky lady ? " " i ca n't tell you that . i 'm better off just going with my gut when it comes to the business . " " good luck with that
[104/1000]	" i suppose so . and what the heck is that ? " the second soldier 's gun bucked , but the second soldier gripped the barrel of his own gun , aiming straight at the soldier 's face
[105/1000]	his anger melted away and his eyes softened . " sorry now that we got all our feet on the ground and ca n't run , " dylan said without apology . " i 'm not ? "
[106/1000]	" not so great like you described it . " he nodded . " did you know people died in the fire ? " " i 've heard that . " " how many of you
[107/1000]	i 've been waiting for this day for days . this year , i 'm ready . i grab a pair of light - pink flip - flops and grab my bathing suit and the book . in minutes
[108/1000]	" have a cup too . " as she picked up her cup , she noticed the empty cup in ryan 's hand . " what ? " he said , taking a sip , then closing his eyes
[109/1000]	he was watching me , and after a few moments his gaze drifted down and met mine . i glanced away and bit the inside of my cheek . " i just thought - " " about what ?
[110/1000]	" sorry , i ca n't remember what we discussed , but we do n't have anything in common . " " that 's ok , " she said , " i think we have a lot to talk
[111/1000]	" what do you want me to do ? " " nothing . i want you to learn more while i was gone . you have your own home to escape from . use that power to protect yourself
[112/1000]	* * * i was sitting across from the one called jonathan , just as i had in every class during my freshman year of college because i wanted to be with him , in this moment .
[113/1000]	her uncle left first and then she heard his deep breath as he ran down the stairs . " come on , sweetheart , let 's get out of here , " he said when he reached the bottom
[114/1000]	" if you do n't mind , i was going to take him out of town . " he looked at her like she was an adorable puppy dog . " yes , but i do n't think that
[115/1000]	with a quick nod of his head , he turned and walked down the sidewalk without acknowledging the man 's presence , not even glancing back . the man 's eyes followed alex from where he 'd first approached .
[116/1000]	" hey , you do n't look so good . " the brunette called out . i forced a cheerful smile and felt like crap . one thing i knew about being someone 's personal vice was that i
[117/1000]	" oh great , " i muttered , feeling bad for the girl from the train station and the woman from the train station . i looked up ; my sister had pulled the strap of her backpack up beside
[118/1000]	" and how old have you been ? " i asked . " twelve ? " " of course . " i 'd been fifteen , but it had n't been that long . <EOS> you can
[119/1000]	" i could n't help it , " jake said . " if you see a ghost , it happens too often . all else fails when you try to convince one . " jake cocked his head and said
[120/1000]	" the other night you said it was n't your fault in the club . " she shrugged . " so your best friend 's just saying it . why ? is there nothing you can say that will make
[121/1000]	she stopped in the middle of the road , staring . " what 's going on ? " she asked , shaking her head . " i never said anything to you about a truck . " i glanced
[122/1000]	" that 's funny , because i 've been listening to you talk an awful lot . " he arched one dark brow at that . " tell me about it . " she could n't resist teasing
[123/1000]	" i think they 're starting to count on us for the job . why ca n't there be a bigger group , that should be together ? " " there 's three separate groups . the first group
[124/1000]	she was n't sure how to respond . the shock of seeing him and knowing how much damage she could do to his face was still a shock . what had just happened ? " i 'm sorry , i
[125/1000]	" the man to whom she owes so much money belongs to her , and to whom her family owes so much money - it 's not what it appears to be , " i argued . " to me
[126/1000]	my jaw dropped . she could n't think past this . and just like that i think it was over . " i did n't - " " stop it , avery . " she put her
[127/1000]	" that 's it ! do n't forget that you are some kind of demon who also eats ... your kind ! " " whatever that means , " agreed ryan , still pointing at the glowing sword .
[128/1000]	but the worst had never occurred . he was so caught up in his love for her that he 'd forgotten that this had never happened in the first place . had n't he just assumed nothing , for the
[129/1000]	' oh , this is lovely . ' she hugged him in his tight , square hug . ' i 've missed you . thank you , teddy . i 've been missing you for years . ' '
[130/1000]	" with this " said lea , now standing to face lea . while lea was moving forward , salena noticed salena 's gaze and quickly shook her head at lea . salena and alinda moved towards the bed ,
[131/1000]	" or a girl . " when she hesitated he added , " why ? " she 'd told him before that she had n't been around often enough to allow herself to enjoy any intimate parts of a
[132/1000]	" it 's different , " i said . " everything is different . " after i put a little more space between us , i leaned down and kissed her on the cheek . " yeah , i
[133/1000]	and he did n't even know . he 'd just seen a stranger disappear into the house , so he guessed it was n't even quite nighttime here . at a stoplight on the street , he opened his door
[134/1000]	" i really prefer you to be with your sister . " " i like it when you think i am her mother , " she teased . " she 's sweet , i 'll give her that
[135/1000]	" if we 're not going to find it , " mark said to the assembled group of students . " should we just wait for the cops ? we have nowhere to go anyway . " mark was
[136/1000]	i sigh again . of all people , i should n't have to ask someone . " well , you 're a good friend to ask . " " hey , are you excited to know that the band
[137/1000]	" let 's get out of here , " ty told him with a pained look . " okay ? " " okay , " zane said without moving . but at the same time , he found hearing
[138/1000]	i look down at the paper in my hand , and i am not sure what to write . i can not remember everything that happened - not exactly . i just know that some bits of me were too
[139/1000]	" you did you ? " he shook his head , his face white . " no . you have my word . " " really ? " he smiled . " yeah . you would n't believe
[140/1000]	" i am certainly grateful to the king and everyone in his kingdom . most nights as long as he has me , he does n't seem the slightest bit affected . i 'm sure it 's because i am
[141/1000]	he was still looking as though he might need to go to the bathroom . i quickly caught up with him . " i 'm hungry again . " well , i was n't hungry . i was craving food
[142/1000]	" i do n't know how . so , can you ask him ? " " you ca n't . " " oh , yes i can . " i pointed my finger at the phone . "
[143/1000]	" so we can go check it out , maybe ? " " you are curious , my friend . the more you know , the more you will find that your curiosity will keep you out of the
[144/1000]	' i had to get away for a little while , ' he replied . ' i never intended not to find you . ' ' i could have done without that , ' she said primly . then
[145/1000]	" it 's your lucky day . " <EOS> getting up again with the bag of money " now run and bring out the treasure ! let 's go . " the little boy turned and ran to the
[146/1000]	" fine , " i grunt . there 's a loud noise in the background and a click and i wonder if he 's disconnected from his phone . i wonder if he deleted it , like his dad
[147/1000]	" i get it , i get it . you 're a cop . you 're a cop and you 're a tough cookie . " i kept silent , thinking i did not understand her and she did
[148/1000]	" right after an assassination , " muttered the prince . " the only ones i 've ever heard of in my lifetime - i 'm good at keeping people guessing , as you say , " added tomaz
[149/1000]	" so , you came , " he said . " were you trying to tell me that it was because i was some kind of danger and that i was going to use you for a human shield ?
[150/1000]	" i need to speak with the queen <EOS> was one of the gods . do not trouble anyone . let my guard down . " " as far as she goes . " " no one 's
[151/1000]	" not at all . i would n't have thought so until we had more time to spend together . " i was surprised that people would give their opinion on anything . i 'm not an over thinker
[152/1000]	" he is , and he 's coming with us , " i said , putting that part in as carefully as i could . " i suppose you have to take a shower with him . i went
[153/1000]	" i 'll talk to your coach . i was kidding , he 's a good coach . " i smile over at him . the captain and coach sit at the table in the same row . the
[154/1000]	then the only thing i can think about is how to get out of here . " wait ! " i look over my shoulder just in time to see her running next to us , dodging guys
[155/1000]	" really ? " " yes , he wants me to move here in two weeks from now . so i 'm changing to a one bedroom on the second floor , no other living space . we can
[156/1000]	the first thing i noticed when i opened the door was the absence of the smell of food . i did n't even have enough time to pick up any in the building . in fact , i think i
[157/1000]	i shrugged . " he does n't know about the party . and he will . there 's no way he 'll miss it . " " if not , then will you be staying here now ? "
[158/1000]	" do you want to stay ? " he asked . before she could answer , he scooped her on his shoulder and carried her through the crowd . she was practically limp with exhaustion . despite the fact
[159/1000]	but i knew they were so much closer to home than i was . " i 'm sorry . " he shook his head . " come on . you 're more than welcome here . " "
[160/1000]	" a man with a woman ... i ca n't get you to think straight . you 're driving me nuts . " he smiled at me with a light - hearted expression that said he would n't complain
[161/1000]	" not it . " " because if it was , there 's a good chance he 's out to get me and he 'll use that to get to you . " " he could be anyone
[162/1000]	he 'd read about them in books . why in the fuck is he always with that - that girl ... " do you know his name , angel , " he asked , lifting his eyes from
[163/1000]	" i need a big kiss , " i said , but he did n't move . " no , " he said . " okay then let 's go . " " a kiss , "
[164/1000]	or you might get over this and get all bummed out that his girlfriend , sarah , will never be in the future . if that were the case , she would get me back for inviting her over .
[165/1000]	" oh , i 'm sorry , " said miss black , suddenly feeling very uncomfortable in that dress . " well , that 's quite impossible . he does n't want me . he says we 're friends and
[166/1000]	the old woman opened her eyes and looked at her through long sooty lashes . " go to sleep , " she said . so she did just that . the darkness in the room was nearly complete .
[167/1000]	" no , " i said , shaking my head . " do n't worry , but what i saw ... he did n't look human . " " what ? " she screamed , grabbing my arm .
[168/1000]	" no , it 's not . i do n't make the rules . " a hint of a smile played on his lips as he watched me . " what does that mean ? " " in
[169/1000]	" thanks for coming . " he lifted and lowered himself until he was standing on the tip of the roof . when there was a moment of silence , he said , " this seems awkward enough without more
[170/1000]	" i love you , " she says and leans over to kiss me . " i love you , too . " chapter 6 the next morning i wake up before my alarm goes off ,
[171/1000]	" i 've been wanting you to touch me for weeks , " he said huskily . she turned her gaze back to see his face . he was so close and she found she could see everything there
[172/1000]	" who is i ? " i asked , confused . " a friend of his , " the female said , and her arm moved to sweep gavin 's cheek . i did n't know what to think
[173/1000]	" uh huh . " he shrugged , dismissing me . " just wanted to tell you that we 've got his first . then you 're coming with me , and i 'm taking you to new york
[174/1000]	there was a slight delay before i heard her say softly , " i know you do n't understand . well , that 's one of the reasons i came back . i need you to know that . you
[175/1000]	his grin faded . " why should i ? " i frowned . " because you 've never told a girl in a million years . " " not true . " his eyes scanned the room .
[176/1000]	" let 's find him . " they walked down to the front door of the apartment complex , where they found the uniformed patrolman standing there . " mr. kingsley is waiting for you in room 3
[177/1000]	" maybe . " " where 'd that come from ? " i asked , turning to her . " i made a comment , " she said , looking out the window . " that i feel
[178/1000]	the elevator closed . * * * " what have you done ? " " um , you know , we have some unfinished business . " " i 'm glad . i mean for a
[179/1000]	" no . " i shake my head as though thinking back over those final few seconds . " do you think he could be your date for the evening ? " mom inquires . " a simple yes
[180/1000]	but he still said nothing . " i want to think she was attacked , " angie turned to jamie . " i want to believe it . " to jamie she said , " i need to believe
[181/1000]	" this one 's for you . it knows . " " what ? " i felt as if every cell in my body was on fire when he handed me the little card from dr. je ky ll
[182/1000]	a strong wind blew , and my hair blew back in a puff of sea - spray . in the distance , i could see two ships ... looking up through the gloom again , i saw a silver
[183/1000]	" if i had looked at you you would have gotten up there and caught me , " she said . " those are the ones i love . " our bodies were pressed so closely together ; it
[184/1000]	the woman glanced at the door then back at him . " in the meantime , i 'm going to tell you a story about two very similar times . " chapter twelve " you mean that one
[185/1000]	then my eyes followed and i saw that jack had already disappeared . and the scene played out right in front of me . a crowd of onlookers stood on a road , a couple of a dozen
[186/1000]	i shook my head , watching him . " i thought i was dead . i thought i was in heaven . " he shook his head , watching me , and then he brought his thumb to his
[187/1000]	" she probably wo n't come . " " you think so ? " he lifted his head and winked at me from under long , golden hair . " what should we do ? " " we
[188/1000]	" you think they 're killing them ? " the question struck them both on the spot . " we have to find one , " jane said . " even if you have a solid idea
[189/1000]	she looked at him , her expression tight . " he 's the biggest as shat i 've ever known . i 'm guessing he does n't know you , " he added without thinking . <EOS> a
[190/1000]	you know what i mean , do n't you , my man ? " " no , you idiot , i do n't know , " i said , " i 've met women your , what , fourteen
[191/1000]	" you 've been drinking . " she pointed a finger right at him . " drink . or i swear to god , your insides look like hamburger . " without waiting for an answer , she strode
[192/1000]	" i know this is n't easy for you , " she said , letting her hand fall back to her side . " but you 've done so much for me , your friends have been so supportive ,
[193/1000]	" i know the man i met in the woods on thursday . he was out in the woods and the night he died . would you like to meet him ? " she considered for a moment ,
[194/1000]	the next day at a meal service , his husband had been quiet . " papa , would you mind asking me something ? " " yes , just a moment , sweetie . " the question
[195/1000]	please ... please do not laugh . i do not want to lose another man . for one moment i considered not coming down , but i also suspected what i was feeling inside and i knew i was
[196/1000]	" okay , thank you , " i say , unsure of what to do with the information . " so your parents are at the apartment ? " " yeah , " he says flatly . " they
[197/1000]	" you 're not , " gage says and pulls me over until my body is flush against his . the cool breeze ruffles my hair , and i let it slip out of its constraints . " well ,
[198/1000]	' all right , ' she muttered , not at all happy that some little shit had n't been doing his job . with a sudden surge of adrenaline , she sprinted across the lobby to the elevator doors
[199/1000]	" wait , do n't go . " i tried to pull off the necklace . " why not ? " he pulled back , removing the pendant . " this is a - it 's not like
[200/1000]	" he 's going to have a breakdown if we do n't do something , " i mumble . " what are we going to tell him ? " " i do n't know . i already called my
[201/1000]	as they moved toward the top deck , they could hear the rumble of heavy metal drums and the roar of the wind . there were a few trees surrounding the top deck , but a lot of the trees
[202/1000]	" my father has to spend a few hours with some visitors . we might think <EOS> on it for a while , but when are we going to get his attention ? " he said , the smile returning
[203/1000]	" you did good , coach , " i say , beaming warmly . " i can wait forever . " <EOS> , the best thing to do as far away as possible , or else i 'll have
[204/1000]	" i think we should have a funeral . " jason drew in his breath and then exhaled slowly . " are you kidding ? it would be the last time we 'd do it . " "
[205/1000]	" what ? " i exclaimed as he slid something cold against my tongue . " what is that ? " he smiled a little . " i could n't stop myself . " " i do n't
[206/1000]	even though he had n't seen them in countless years . if he said she had been , would he be correct ? after all i did ... " i 'm sorry , " i whispered in
[207/1000]	it was n't the best place to talk about the issues she and kevin had been having . they were n't exactly a deep , abiding couple , and it could n't have been easy for them . a
[208/1000]	chapter nine one year later we decided to stop by and pick up a box of cereal , since it seemed like all those nights we 'd picked up a box of cereal had to come home to
[209/1000]	but after a long while the rest of us were more than ready to go to bed . in one of the halls to my left , the wall slid back and my sister fell . a dark figure swept
[210/1000]	his smile was half - confused . " well , i did have you for a minute - how can i not ? " " how about we call it quits ? " " so what , you
[211/1000]	i glanced over at the others and they were smiling . " what ? " " it 's just the principle , " aiden mumbled . " it 's supposed to get ugly . it 's not supposed to
[212/1000]	" no , but we think you 're there . on the screen . " " me ? " i snorted . " do n't be ridiculous . there 's no ... " my gaze slid down to her
[213/1000]	" i did n't think so . but i 'm sure i 'll know soon enough . and i would n't forget , mother said that you 'd ask me . " it was n't often that the duchess
[214/1000]	he stood his ground . " so who do you think is behind all this mischief ? " " there 's no one . none at all . a thief and a traitor . and they all got together
[215/1000]	his phone buzzed , and i reached for it , happy to hear from him . " is anything wrong ? " i asked , putting the phone to my ear . " about what ? "
[216/1000]	he 'd loved her as he had that afternoon when she 'd brought him daisies and chocolate , and she 'd loved him then , too without being greedy for all that he 'd given . now as his
[217/1000]	" i do . " " what should i call you then ? " he asked . " well , " she said . " i 'm glad you do n't play games . " " that
[218/1000]	" what ? who ? " " eric ! " " wait . " i grabbed her wrist so i could see her face . her cheeks were wet , her eyes shining with excitement . " did
[219/1000]	she said , ' yes , you are . you 're the one who was too smart to notice any detail on the subject , ' as if to deny this fact , giving me her version of what we
[220/1000]	how did you look so innocent that it was a good thing he had to stop you ? but then he could n't stop the smile that danced across his face . " what did i do ?
[221/1000]	ethan walked in and made his way to the bedroom where emma was lying on a massive bed . he stood over her and took her hand . the bracelet on her wrist gleamed in the darkness . " who
[222/1000]	my stomach lurched at the thought . did they have a way to erase a year and a half from the calendar - what were they planning ? i 'd already learned about the one on my way into the
[223/1000]	" for what ? " she answered with disdain , a hand coming up to squeeze her own head in frustration . " well , for the ... i 'm sort of in love with you . " i
[224/1000]	there you have it ! it was n't only the one word , it was the same one that you said a week ago , then that used to be your first thought , only it still was n't .
[225/1000]	" you 're going to love the part about the guy 's mother . ' he said . " what part of the woman 's name were you talking about ? " " the one whose last name
[226/1000]	then he pulled her in until his arms were wrapped around her , and he was kissing her with all the passion and passion inside him . at the same time , his back went ramrod stiff .
[227/1000]	" thanks . i heard about the battle . i 'm sorry about your daughter but i ca n't save everyone . i do n't really wanna know what 's happening on the streets since i live down there .
[228/1000]	" i 'll come right away , " she assured him , her words an anxious whisper . he heard a brief , rapid noise in response , as if she was struggling to reach the door and then she
[229/1000]	" who are you ? " the doctor asked . " i 'm dr. k ant . " she stared at her and then at michael . " where is he ? " " he 's in
[230/1000]	i pulled up a chair . " i will not let that happen , olivia , " i said . " let 's get to it then . go on . " " she wants me to
[231/1000]	" no . can you tell me your feelings on some of the other cases ? " " yes i can . " " i 'm going to start with the old incident report and the first couple

[234/1000]	" let me through , you bastard ! " he smiled . " you might want to try the door ahead of you , " he said , holding up a hand to stop her . the man stopped
[235/1000]	" my guess is that the two of them are headed for someplace close and close , " i said . " perhaps wherever has n't received much attention yet . " " i 'd think they 'd end
[236/1000]	" i was hoping you would be this comfortable . " " only if you tell me all about it . " he moves her to the edge of the bed , then pulls me into his arms .
[237/1000]	her voice was husky and deep , made more seductive by its depths than a million - dollar view . her dark eyes were dark and fathomless , but as hungry for him as she was . her lips parted
[238/1000]	and i took out the necklace and dangled it in front of her face . " wear this . " as she took it from me , i caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror . her dark
[239/1000]	i stared at her through the pain , and she stared at me with a pained expression on her face . " please , " i whispered , " try to understand . this is the best , the

[242/1000]	in the end , the best friend was the only piece of advice i could find - " do n't be afraid that you might hear more about the book in the future than you want to , " my
[243/1000]	" not right after we talked about other things , " she said , and then her grin widened . " but , damn , we both know what this means . i want you too much to let this
[244/1000]	nick took a deep breath , but it caught in his throat . " um . . . i was . . . i was really pissed off then , right ? " nick pointed to the clock .
[245/1000]	" good thing you did n't go through the usual , " i yelled over the chaos , earning a few more curses from the girl i 'd just met . then she pulled away and headed for the door
[246/1000]	she was right ; she could n't stand there and argue . " fine ! do n't call me again this week either . " she hung up , and stood there , staring at the room , feeling
[247/1000]	he pulls her close to kiss her head and says , " i have no intention of leaving you . you 'd be too nice to me to leave you in the field alone for more than three minutes .
[248/1000]	" i have to do something to get my mind off of things , " she said . " please do n't think otherwise . " " i wo n't , " he mumbled and nodded . " goodnight
[249/1000]	" i 'll be back in a little while . just let them know how sorry i am and how good you 're feeling . it 's in the past and i promise when i get back i 'll let
[250/1000]	" ok , well , it seems they 've re stocked the tanks there , and will probably return tomorrow so we should do their case . " " alright , thanks , they <EOS> " said planner .
[251/1000]	" come on . " he took my hand . " i want to see the results . let 's get it over with . it does n't matter how much i loathe my father , i 'll handle that
[252/1000]	" with both of us ? " " no , with both of us . she 's your wife . and who knows ? maybe there will be love there , or maybe she 'll find you or something
[253/1000]	" he was my mentor , mentor , mentor , and i wo n't keep lying to you , mr. crawford . <EOS> ? " " all right , if you do n't mind . i had n't told
[254/1000]	there she was . in the pale glow of her streetlamp it took his breath away . she had been beautiful before but now she was something else . " god is my companion , " she was saying
[255/1000]	" good point . " " maybe i 'll go for an afternoon stroll and come back home . " at that , he shot a look to the left where the two shadows had gone . he
[256/1000]	" <EOS> i 'll try to talk to him about it , " i assure him . " but if he will , not tonight , tomorrow . " " i 'm sorry . " he strokes my hair
[257/1000]	" that 's for the wrong sake . " he scowled and grabbed her arms . " what did you expect to happen ? " " nothing . " his glare grew darker . " really ?
[258/1000]	" are you a vampire ? " i said , not sure if i understood his words or not . " i am a vampire . " " and you 're not afraid of me , " i
[259/1000]	his eyes narrowed as he stared at the door . " she does n't know you 're watching her ? " her voice was filled with panic . " do n't tell me you 're not f * *
[260/1000]	i glanced for a way under the table , but there was n't time . " i just got done writing a new chapter . " he arched an eyebrow . " good , i 'd hate for you
[261/1000]	" i 've been wondering <EOS> .... " she wondered who this seemed . " you 've got some kind of meeting more for those two questions .... " she thought her face and shook her head slightly . "
[262/1000]	where was her beloved old father ? she peered at the place she had gone : an empty , desolate room . where was she ? she had left the table there a moment ago and stepped into the
[263/1000]	* * * we had n't really talked when i got home , that is , we had n't talked over the phone . but as soon as i walked into the kitchen , luke came in , slamming
[264/1000]	the words had slipped out before she came to work but they had rolled off her tongue like a boulder rolling off a hill . which was stupid and ridiculous ; she was only going to say it out loud
[265/1000]	" i 'm not a child , " emily said . " just because your father was a monster does n't mean she is . " " why would you tell me this if you care too much
[266/1000]	' no , not really . i just went to fetch you the coffee . ' ' thank you . ' and he gave her a little smile , which she promptly returned . for a moment or two
[267/1000]	" it was n't you ? " her eyes darted to the back of the room . if there had been a hint of disgust or revulsion in his voice , it did n't show . " you 're too
[268/1000]	he dropped a kiss on her lips , but a flash of something in his eyes told her that his eyes were dancing . the mood was n't strained or hostile . she could n't tell , but something in
[269/1000]	his head bent low , a little scowl on his face that made his sharp - featured features look sharper . " this does n't fit in , " he muttered , pushing the door to the storage area open
[270/1000]	" do it . " i tried to put on a brave face . " i ca n't . this guy 's out there doing it , and - " i was aware of some other people nearby
[271/1000]	" you should 've checked in with me . i could 've been working things out with you , " he yelled . i wanted him to stop , but i knew he could n't . besides , my
[272/1000]	" i know , " i said with a weak smile . " i really am so sorry . maybe dinner will be less creepy this time . " " sure it will , dear . " we
[273/1000]	" and that was the end of the life of your father , " i say for the record . " but you 're a different breed . you lived under my roof and offered your help . you could
[274/1000]	for the first time since she 'd run away , she did n't feel as trapped by her past as she had then . if only she could forget about her father and her sister and her promise to her
[275/1000]	" so when do we begin ? " dr. wilson asked . kate took a bite of her sandwich , chewed it , then answered " the time is on , tomorrow . why do n't you all come

[278/1000]	i glanced back at my house and noticed it was dark outside . i looked around . mrs. mathews was not home . good , i think she 's home alone for the night . the house was quiet
[279/1000]	" what would that achieve ? " asked lo . " it would make you an icon . " lo tried to reach around the back of the chair and find the cigarette , but found the glass
[280/1000]	" yes , it is . " " let 's have more . " he smiles , " as long as you promise not to be a dog for a second , that means i can feel more .
[281/1000]	" how old are you ? " his wife asked . " a great sixteen - year - old for starters . " " how old 's your daughter ? " " about ten , but she
[282/1000]	she took off her necklace and dropped it in my palm . all i saw came to an end in front of my face . " it 's your necklace . it has your name , " she said
[283/1000]	" the law , " the other man repeated , " says if i do n't keep them , then ... well ... i take 'em , man . " he nodded to the others . they bowed , then

[289/1000]	<EOS> and i was lost in thoughts of the big pink . " i should have said do n't stop . then i realized i 'd just said stop , and because i was surprised , i let go

[294/1000]	the next day in class , alex and i sat at our desks , watching the teacher read . i knew he was studying the way he looked at me but it did n't matter what his eyes were on

[296/1000]	" we 'll leave it to the professionals to decide . " she patted my leg before leaving the room . " no , " i replied . " let 's stay . " what will i tell

[302/1000]	" the one who made the contract with us ? you took the assignment , all right . your grandfather did n't know anything about it , but i sure as hell did . you 're not welcome here .
[303/1000]	" good night , " i said , trying to sound like i meant it . i was tired and suddenly tired of being afraid . i wanted to find a small safe place over there to hide away for
[304/1000]	" i 'm sorry , nick . i really am . " her heart broke . she wanted to scream , yet she could n't . " take care , shay . i 'll find a way for you
[305/1000]	he looked ready to rip out my throat , but stopped and turned back to me . " do n't be mad at me . i could never turn on the lights in your presence , and that 's what
[306/1000]	his brother had taken it out of his brother . " and what of that ? " marcus cleared his throat . " i had assumed that my death was going to have nothing to do with your father
[307/1000]	" now ... " she could n't make any sense of what was really happening . suddenly the room began to buzz . the lights went out . at first , not a sound disturbed the quiet
[308/1000]	" yeah , he did as he wished . " " are you asking where my kid 's dad is ? " " no . " " where ? " the silence as they stared at
[309/1000]	we got inside and i put my phone down on the dining room table . he came over and sat down next to me . " you have a new boyfriend ? " wow , i was so caught up
[310/1000]	her skin felt warm . she lay awake for a long time , staring at the ceiling . " i love you , " she whispered . * * * " get up now ! "
[311/1000]	" there you are ! i was beginning to wonder where you 'd gone ! " one of the men shouted . " oh . er ... i was just ... i came to do some work ; would
[312/1000]	" you were n't lying . we 've known each other . i read your file . nothing in it points to you being anything less than trustworthy . you 've seen the way we looked at each other .
[313/1000]	" no . " " who then ? " " well , unless we can create a body that can transport bodies where the bodies are , our future is sealed , so it 's impossible to get
[314/1000]	no answer . but nothing had been forthcoming from the prince of ravens , either . it was rumored that there was a long period , with the brothers and sister of the prince becoming close - but the
[315/1000]	" you 're too good to me , " he says quietly , his hand moving down to my waist . the touch is soothing ; he 's in control . " i know you do n't think that .
[316/1000]	" i 'm not a man , " i said as we held each other up like a couple of birds for each other 's amusement . " neither am i. " " what then ? " i
[317/1000]	" no , " i croaked . " i mean if you are - " " you do n't have to explain . i - i understand . " he lifted his chin , forcing his eyes to meet
[318/1000]	" what , a dozen of us ? " " more . " " five , maybe ? " " probably . " she started looking around . " how long have you paid for
[319/1000]	" i still have to check it , " he says . he turns and walks back toward the bar . i pull the file and the file closer to me in my lap and then pull up the
[320/1000]	the other man smiled faintly , revealing two sharp canines that flashed white in the black firelight . a feral look sparked in the man 's eyes , then was gone . more ice poured through thomas . "
[321/1000]	i gave her a faint smile . " of course , mrs. saunders . " she sighed the sigh of a tired mother . " you know my son too well . " i smiled and nodded .
[322/1000]	but something made me pause . <EOS> - what was i asking ? were you worried about him or anything like that ? " " no . why ? " " i just wondered , " i said
[323/1000]	' why , you do n't look like you 've been through a lot ... ' but before i had time to start to answer , she was there , and she was holding out both of her arms to
[324/1000]	he took a step forward , his eyes still locked on hers . " please , " she whispered . " i 'm sorry i had to tell you , but i need you right now . i ca
[325/1000]	" he needs help , " she said . " he needs to find a cure . " " if he can make a potion that works , he can become a wolf . " she shook her
[326/1000]	they came into view at the base where a small landing strip filled with jeeps and tanks sat next to a road that stretched from the bridge across the river to the bridge and into the buildings where a white
[327/1000]	" so , what he told us about his past - your dad made some big deals with your dad ? " kate said . " my , my , yes ! that 's right . he told us
[328/1000]	" it 's just the way you 're always cutting your steak , that 's all . " after they finished everything in the buffet , they went back to their room to get some sleep . when paul
[329/1000]	i do n't have to tell you what the truth was . " she shrugged . " but you 've made it clear i 've upset you , and i 've made sure not to bother you again . so
[330/1000]	it was probably one of me being paranoid , but my reaction was n't normal . i knew what i had done . the demon prince was here . " can i have that ? " i asked ,
[331/1000]	the girls walked slowly toward one another , passing both their classes . once they had entered the hallway , amber looked back at the twins . " why does it bother you so much , guys ? "
[332/1000]	" she 's not in the office . " " is she an ass * * le ? " " a what ? " " an ass * * le . " " ah , yeah
[333/1000]	" yeah but it 's always a bitch , honey . " " i do n't speak to a woman twice in a row . " tack shot me an amused look . then he started walking
[334/1000]	" you would n't . " i could n't imagine that . it 's not as if she was just joking about it . " i bet you forget all about me , too , because you know i
[335/1000]	my stomach lurched . there was no question , no doubt , i was in trouble . " can i just call you ? " they had come to the club with me . they gave me blood - "
[336/1000]	" what , no one told you that ? i was hoping it was the truth ... not that any of those guys would - " he was pushing his way through the throng of laughing tourists . "
[337/1000]	there was a crash from the front room and she looked over in time to see a flaming bag tumble out of the attic , landing at the far end of the hallway , then falling to the floor ,
[338/1000]	" i am now , " he admitted carefully , " but there are other ways . " she closed her eyes and opened them to study his face . he had n't been lying when he said he
[339/1000]	her breath came hard , and her pulse beat wildly in her neck . he kissed her again , harder , with more passion . she met him for a breathless moment before shaking her head and gasping
[340/1000]	" what could he have wanted with her ? " the woman 's attention suddenly seemed to be drawn away from the baby in her lap and her attention was focussed on her husband . " oh , we really
[341/1000]	" that 's like a lie , " she said . instead of sitting down i looked down at her , then slowly over at the clock . there was something in the glass she was looking at that looked
[342/1000]	" i know . " without another word she turned and left the room , quickly coming back later to look down on me . turning right to face me , she said , " i can call him
[343/1000]	" shit . " my head snapped over to see tim leaning over my leg . " what the f * * k is that thing ? " asked finn . " get it off , spike .
[344/1000]	the first step was easy . <EOS> or not good enough ? perhaps he could try to push her all the way over the line , into letting him into her life if he so wished . he
[345/1000]	" she does a wonderful job of getting rid of them . " sean snorted again . " she does n't have time . " simon scoffed . oh yeah , that was a tough idea to get
[346/1000]	" if you 're looking for one , you 're on your own . i 'm not about going after him . " i got up and moved toward him . he made a face . " do n't
[347/1000]	" he 's a good man . he is . " " he 's right the first time . that 's why i love him . when you get married , it 's a couple dozen people down on
[348/1000]	" then you would have to prove it to me for real because the whole deal stinks . at least once a month , i 'll have to find a way to get to you . that 's a lot
[349/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " " there 's been some bad news this weekend , " i blurt . " i do n't know everything , but - " " did you see another accident yesterday ?
[350/1000]	" yeah , that , too , " i mutter . " you sure ? " he asks . " yeah , " i agree as i force a smile . " are you sure you just
[351/1000]	" wait , wait , are you sure ? " " yes , well , just wait , " he said almost to himself . " i do n't know . " he 'd just had a little too
[352/1000]	" it will be alright , " he whispered and she did n't question him at all . he stopped and held her close to him for about two seconds . then he grabbed the back of her shirt and
[353/1000]	" how long have we been dating ? " cassie asked . " seven months . " " that 's months . " cassie shook her head . the past year of her life was like nothing she
[354/1000]	" but you 're her brother . " " only because of her beauty . are you going to let her know ? or are we supposed to stay out of each other 's way ? " "
[355/1000]	she shook her head as she took out her phone . " i 'm still not at a loss for words . you saw , for yourself , what passed between the three of us today , and it was
[356/1000]	if we could just hold on to him , let him feel us , he 'd be okay . i grabbed one of the legs of the couch , and he grabbed my ankle , spinning me . he
[357/1000]	" why did you say you were going somewhere i could n't find you ? " " because i wanted to talk to you about it . i thought you might have remembered something . i did n't want
[358/1000]	" you 've said , " he spoke softly . " have you always regretted what happened , or your father ? " " my dad ? " i stared at him in confusion . " i 'm not
[359/1000]	" my lord , " said henry , " if you are not interested in becoming a maester , this will be no trouble at all for me . is there anything else ? ' " i can not
[360/1000]	" i 'm tired of it all , " i said . " and i think you have one hell of a life out there , in the deep states . " " the cold water i want is
[361/1000]	there had never been , not in the years between his first and only kiss , not even in that book he 'd read when he was a little boy because he could never remember when he last read a
[362/1000]	" you know , now that you mention it , you should be a little more discreet about it , " kate hissed . " a little more covert ? " " are you kidding me ? i 'm
[363/1000]	slowly , i realized that i was getting back to the routine . i could n't afford to have people getting ideas about what my life would be like if i stayed . there would be no stopping for me
[364/1000]	" you want some ? " he said . she shook her head . " no . i 'm just tired . thank you very much , mr. black . but no , thank you . " "
[365/1000]	' well , i 'll be ... ' she began , and looked back at the door . ' good luck , ' she said . ' well , ' said rincewind . that was something . something <EOS> ,
[366/1000]	" go . " his muscles tense i can see a subtle tremble . i 'm just so glad he 's not giving me a hard time about being pissed off . " i have n't told cash yet
[367/1000]	" my friend , your body is now your body , you have the power to cast the spell . you may have the right to try , but it is over . you know we will try to stop
[368/1000]	" in my head , you were going to seduce me , " he said , then closed his eyes once more . she did n't know how to reply . when he opened them , he was staring
[369/1000]	" let 's go see her and make sure she 's okay , " his dad said , and after a slight hesitation , ryan did as his dad suggested . " you 're sure ? " ryan
[370/1000]	the man shrugged . " i just do n't see what reason i have to live under the same roof with another woman . " " what woman ? who do you think you 're playing ? "
[371/1000]	the old house of cards , called in the hills by all of the american patriots , was a popular attraction for a young girl a year younger then herself . a four bedroom , two bath mansion , which
[372/1000]	the phone rang and rang . she got up from her desk and went down the hallway . she answered the phone , " what is it ? " she asked a woman 's voice and her face turned to
[373/1000]	" i was hoping you 'd join us for lunch . " " why ? what 's this i 've heard about you and mr. blake beating him up for looking at you naked and you never do anything
[374/1000]	she 's going to be furious if i keep letting things go this long . and not just because i 'm not helping her in bed , either , but because i 'm just as annoyed as she .
[375/1000]	ethan 's voice made her shiver . it had a husky rasp that sent shivers of awareness across her skin . hell ... what ? he made her shiver , too . " please , " she begged .
[376/1000]	" that 's not what i do , " i insist . " then what do you do ? " i shrug . " nothing . just what i do . " he studies me . "
[377/1000]	" you two guys really have a crush on each other ? " " yeah , we are . " " you 're friends with the girl who came into the bar , are n't you ? "
[378/1000]	she laughed and sat up . " i appreciate your honesty . not to give me a hard time , but before i slept with him yesterday , i had a bad dream . one that involved me and him
[379/1000]	the door opened loudly behind joe and joe turned to see bob to omer standing under the tree . he looked so out of place in his purple stained t - shirt , blue jeans and tight jean jacket .
[380/1000]	the sun rose and rays burned through the dusty grey walls and created deep shadow that fell about my body and made me want to snuggle inside - so i did . i tried to take a breath . "
[381/1000]	" you ? was that a first ? " " not for me , nothing is permanent . " i pulled the hair pull off my arm . " what are you talking about ? or are you
[382/1000]	" i hope you do . " when he drew near , his mouth turned downwards <EOS> as she smiled , as he lifted . she did n't even look at him , but none that was any more
[383/1000]	i pulled the collar up around my neck , even though i was feeling pretty cold . so then , since i did n't have the energy to really get cold , i reached for a jacket after he dragged
[384/1000]	" what ? " " maybe ... maybe you want to start looking inside of that girl again . " the words , spoken so bluntly , startled him . he had n't meant to say them that
[385/1000]	" no , really ! " she insisted in a low voice . " he needs to be allowed to stay here for more than four days before getting sick . you have to talk to him now - please
[386/1000]	as he reached for the other one , a white flash blinded david . he stumbled back and fell into a roll . he could n't see . the only thing he could see were bright white stars and the
[387/1000]	" okay then , i guess tomorrow 's a new day for the staff . " " sure , " he said . chapter 6 monday afternoon and <EOS> and day 's agenda began as a routine
[388/1000]	" look , " reacher said . " they were all so convinced it was all a mistake , and now they have witnesses . the evidence is all enough there is . it turns out they were wrong ,
[389/1000]	" that 's where we were going ? what time is it ? " " about three o'clock . why do n't you lay out a couple of clothes for me and get back to sleep ? "
[390/1000]	" have you seen the latest news ? " he asked , his hand flying over his heart . " you mean about the media circus that 's happening ? " " yeah . " he shook his
[391/1000]	" i guess . " i shrug . " i was just thinkin ' about the war . you 've seen a lot of things . " he nods . " i 've been out a lot , has
[392/1000]	i laughed . " stop it . " " if we only had more time , you could sneak it back here , " he joked . just then the bathroom door opened . " um .... hello
[393/1000]	" uh - huh . " her fingers curled tight over his but she was already moving to the master bedroom . it had a king - size bed and a dresser . in addition to her bag , the
[394/1000]	" <EOS> " is what i am . " " that is not true and you know it . i might have felt it , but you did n't <EOS> . " " it is not really worth
[395/1000]	a small , confused noise escaped his lips . " my apologies , " he said . he went to move past her , and she grabbed his arm . " do n't be stupid . you need me
[396/1000]	" i thought you hated it here ? " " not hate , no , " he said , " but it 's not my most favorite place . " " that 's what i just told you
[397/1000]	if a man could break a man 's neck with a thought , a half - second later a second man could smash the whole of his head into the rock face . the next attack came coming from
[398/1000]	it 's too easy that he just says it , like it 's the most natural thing . " so , as i said when we first met , i would love to know where you 've been and
[399/1000]	the first thing i did when i opened the door of my house was hug her warmly , knowing i would need a lot of reassurance in the coming days . " how 's bob ? " " he
[400/1000]	" and to think i planned to buy your mother her own house . " when i refused to tell them he 'd been stalking me the last couple of days , they 'd accused each other of murder .
[401/1000]	" i mean for a good reason . " we both looked at her . " to make sure that no one found her , and nothing happened later , " i continued . " right .
[402/1000]	" look , " i said , " maybe i should n't have - " " i am warning you . i do n't want you spending that much time with him , either . and he might beat
[403/1000]	" how 's she doing ? " " does n't feel like she even knows where i 'm from anymore , " he said . i laughed . he sounded happy to hear from me . " do
[404/1000]	" i thought he was gon na take you by force , " john said . " oh , i just told him i was done being a cop . " john laughed . " and you got
[405/1000]	the moment he was inside her , he eased out and she clung to him ; pleasure rushed over her and she moaned , meeting his thrusts , matching his thrusts . he groaned as they kissed . she
[406/1000]	" the police officer 's car , " he repeated , and his voice was very soft . " where ? " " right here . the building on the street end . two cars like that one
[407/1000]	though the young woman had asked his opinion , he had n't wanted to disappoint her . so he did what he had expected doing from a distance . he joined her . he slid his arm around her
[408/1000]	' i see , ' said lord vetinari , and was interrupted by drum kno tt . lord vetinari made the sign of the white sheep in front of vetinari 's desk and then reached into a desk drawer
[409/1000]	" oh , that 's my cue , " i said , sliding up higher on the bed . " go ahead and look . " turning on the hall light , she picked up her cell . i
[410/1000]	it 's nearly two o'clock before she pulls herself together . by the time she gets out of bed , the doorbell rings and she 's annoyed at herself . it could be anyone . leaving her laptop and
[411/1000]	he seemed to be breathing faster , his eyes narrowed like he was on the verge of a fight and she was the prey . she gulped down the fear of being caught or killed , the fear of him
[412/1000]	" i think he 's the one who gave away the formula , not you . " " do n't be ridiculous ! " isabel shouted at him . he continued to watch her . " is that
[413/1000]	" do you know what else we 've decided ? " the captain asked . " some of it already occurred to me , " the sailor smiled . " we 'll have a bit of a surprise for
[414/1000]	" for heaven 's sake , man . you 're not even trying . " " why would i try ? " i answered in a deadpan voice . i was n't sure where i was going with it
[415/1000]	for now , though , they had nothing . she was nothing more than a prostitute , a little whore who gave pleasure to a man . the one thing there was to thank for , the one thing that
[416/1000]	he was on his side , a foot clear of an empty space , and she knelt beside him . he was propped in the crook of one arm , his face in the crook of his arm , staring
[417/1000]	he 'd just told her that his brother was dead . no way jordan would hurt her over something so unimportant . not even if he is going to die . sarah knew jordan would die , and
[418/1000]	i could n't help , one long sigh escaped me . " stop . " " a vampire . a very impressive one , and for what ? making you my prisoner and taking possession of you . "
[419/1000]	" i can never tell , " she said . " everyone is afraid to answer . it 's like our fears are just just too big . there 's too much - and it just gets too big .
[420/1000]	not knowing if he 'd ever take the effort of even opening his eyes again , he fell asleep against his pillow . chapter 22 two years later the next time she woke up , her eyes
[421/1000]	" yeah , i 'll be all right . " he stood in the doorway and watched as i hurried towards the kitchen to start the coffee . " i said , i 'll be fine . i have
[422/1000]	" i wo n't cry , but i need to get him home . " she reached out her hand . " i love you . " " i love you , too . " the last few
[423/1000]	" it 's the perfect place to go after the rodeo . " " well , i 'm in that building . it 's a couple minutes away . " " you sure it 's not your mom
[424/1000]	" in life ? " " yeah . " " what happened ? " " how could i help them ? who asked me ? they were too damn cold ! they said if i wanted to
[425/1000]	he sighed . " yeah , i have better things to do than spend my day looking for new dates . " " how are you going to pay her back for what she did to you ... and
[426/1000]	that time would come soon enough , after all . the sound of heavy boots stomping on the patio brought her head up and she watched as marcus came into the patio garden . when he reached her and reached
[427/1000]	then i fell in love . did that answer his question ? did it show me he was as afraid of us as i was ? did he want me as much as i wanted him ?
[428/1000]	" what ? " she said sharply , looking completely flabbergasted . " i ca n't believe i just said that ; there 's no way that 's really happened , " she exclaimed with a gasp as she
[429/1000]	" so tell me about yourself . " " i 'm a student at mcgill college , " i said . " this is my first time going to school there . " " i thought that 's
[430/1000]	' get up , ' shouted dark tan . ' that is no place for you ! ' a hand reached from behind dark tan and hauled him to his feet . ' he said , we are not
[431/1000]	by the time my eyes settled back on him , and his eyes dropped down to my face , there was such heat i knew in the back of my mind there was no escape . " i 'm
[432/1000]	she took a deep breath , knowing the problem would soon be solved yet again . " all right . then we have bigger problems . first things first , we 've got to figure out how to save both
[433/1000]	" okay , let 's try this again , " she whispered . " can i ask where you get all these fancy clothes from ? what kind are they ? " it was harder to tell in
[434/1000]	and to think she 'd been so sure that she would n't see him again . the light changed . that light was always light , always . she had n't been sure what she thought of
[435/1000]	two more flights . i 'll pop by the hotel in san diego . ' " oh , no . you ca n't . " " yes , of course i can . would you mind making every
[436/1000]	then he smiled . " okay , buddy . it 's your turn next . " on that , eddie took me away and i could feel his laughter vibrating in my belly . i looked forward
[437/1000]	" i had never heard a single word spoken . " " it 's a perfect alibi . " " the man who drove into town was a homeless guy . how can anyone say otherwise ? "
[438/1000]	" let 's go , " i muttered to jamie , and we began our descent . we had both made land fall a ways upriver , when we heard the faint sound of footsteps behind us . something
[439/1000]	" sorry ? " she said . " if you 're still there , let me know . " " i could n't . " " do n't . i do n't want anything but your reply .
[440/1000]	" i 'm out of wine , " jack said after a while . " it 's okay , jack , " i said . " i 've got these . " holding out the bottles with a flourish
[441/1000]	oh , great . " i 'm here to work today . " " i 'm not surprised , actually . you have n't been home for more than three hours . let me apologize . " "
[442/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " " we went to visit him this morning . he was like a father to me . " her voice was strangled . " he was like a son to me
[443/1000]	" fine . what do you want ? " " i wondered if you wanted to have lunch after work ? " " sure . " " how about i pick you up around five ? "
[444/1000]	they sat , locked together , in the middle of the living room . in the shadows , the night turned to day and the sky became black . " my name is joshua . " "
[445/1000]	" do n't have a thing to do with it ! " said the king loudly enough to wake up the rest of the palace - folk . " i 'll see you in a few months , anyway .
[446/1000]	" you 're not the first . " " yeah , " she said , and we were silent for a moment . not the kind of silence you can do a quick glance back at or open your
[447/1000]	" you should have told me , " she snaps . " why could n't you tell me ? and so quickly ? " " i did n't want you to think i do n't care for you sexually
[448/1000]	" we 'll deal with it when the time comes . " he dropped down on the bed , pulling me down with him , curling his hand behind my head , holding me to him for a few
[449/1000]	and now she had more than one option to go . she had to find a way to free herself . she 'd know what to do , how . but first she had to find a way
[450/1000]	" why , it was just the beginning , " i said , pushing my sunglasses up to the top of my head and rubbing with my fingers . " what first , why ? " " because
[451/1000]	i ca n't help it ! how is it possible for him ? how can i feel so angry and so stupid ? " i 'm sorry , so , so sorry . " i pick up my suitcase
[452/1000]	" do you want something to drink ? and then you can have it . " " no , thanks , " she said . " you want water ? orange juice ? " the bartender asked .
[453/1000]	" yeah . " i laughed and leaned back against the sand . " you know , i 'm curious as to who else your father may have fathered . " reed and i laughed , and reed
[454/1000]	" tell me you wo n't be crying , " he said . " tell me you wo n't become a weepy little girl with all the problems of the world . tell me that , and i wo n't
[455/1000]	" i will do what i can to get her to the hospital with you . is there someone there i can run to ? " he looked around , " well , do you have a nurse near
[456/1000]	" i figured it out , if my suspicions are correct . let 's not be too hasty . i was there when you and the princess moved in , but i have to confess that i was not truly
[457/1000]	" yes . if you do n't have to go over with her now , please , please do . i 'm sure she 's going to hold that against me , " he said . a few chuckles were
[458/1000]	i nodded to the girl and then began to speak . " i 'm sorry about the story you just told , but i really have a huge problem . " " your name is anna . anna
[459/1000]	i tried to find something else to do with my hands but they were tied up next to the desk so i lost that because he was n't going anywhere . the cop had left my pants on .
[460/1000]	" the girl was ... i mean , after all those hours it was still early morning while i was sleeping . but i remember i had on a blue nightie ... pink one ? ... i think . "
[461/1000]	i 'm lying to you about my feelings for her . " " i do n't get it . you <EOS> much too . and to tell you how beautiful you were , i thought your face was
[462/1000]	" and you wanted a second opinion on this ? you let me think he was just some guy and he took over you ? " " you 're the one who kept asking if he was a friend
[463/1000]	there was a man , and i was certain to never see again , waiting to fulfill his own dark desires . and yet , it did n't feel dark , did n't feel evil , did n't feel
[464/1000]	" he , too , will take you home , " olivia said . the two women glanced up and discovered their older brother standing behind them . " what brings you to seattle ? " stan asked
[465/1000]	that was at her command and she quickly went into her bedroom looking for her jeans . she did n't make it long , she could hear them before she got them on . her face hurt like a bitch
[466/1000]	" a couple of times . " he moved to the side , but she placed her hands on his chest , stopping him . " this feeling is mutual , remember ? we have all the time in the
[467/1000]	" it is done . " my mother said so confidently that i just sat there , confused . * * * in the early morning hours the two children began to move to a secluded nook that
[468/1000]	i tried to get back to the front seat . i went by the door instead . i just wanted to put my hands up in front of me for a minute - to show them that anything was possible
[469/1000]	" it 's good for me , too . " although , if she 'd wanted him around , she could 've walked into the house himself . the next morning she made scrambled eggs and bacon for
[470/1000]	" no , i do n't . we needed you . " " i do n't need any sort of babysitter . i 've seen enough trouble for one lifetime . " she stepped back so she could stare
[471/1000]	we were heading for the elevator when we noticed a flash out of the corner of our eyes . i looked up and saw a group of people in dark suits standing against the corner of the hall .
[472/1000]	" yeah , but ... she 's also ... " " she 's what ? " " the perfect candidate ! " i laughed . " she 's the absolute perfect angel . she looks all glamorous and
[473/1000]	" but - " jamie began . " no , he said he would n't be returning , but it was a promise , " he said , with a quick glance at ian , who sat watching him
[474/1000]	" like what ? " " anything . including being a great host . let 's see what you got . " i pulled out my wallet and handed them a hundred dollar bill . " well
[475/1000]	i take that for a yes . " to tell you the truth , i 'm starting to rethink this career path , seeing as how you 'll probably end up on the list , too , and your choices
[476/1000]	john lifted the second bottle to his lips . " you want it ? " " only if you can get me to give it to you in exchange for our relationship continuing . and you do n't have
[477/1000]	and she would be the woman he wanted to be with and the woman he would stand up for with everything in him . she tried to breathe as if she were in a cloud , but the cold ,
[478/1000]	chapter sixteen " well ? " natalie 's voice startled him from his thoughts , and he swung around to face her . he searched her face for any sign of the anger that was so prevalent there
[479/1000]	" i bet they do . " i laugh . they 're going to hate me , i know . they all know i had a thing for parker . they know exactly what that thing was and we
[480/1000]	" i 'd be in love with the man and i 'd be a bitch to do it in the back seat , " i warn her . " but i 'd actually have to think about it before it
[481/1000]	" it would n't hurt to go to the police , " he repeated . " nobody here cares what you did . the only question was who to call . " " somebody that would know exactly what
[482/1000]	i gave a sharp little laugh at that and threw the beer at him . " here , drink up , it 'll help . " as he accepted the mug and lifted it to his lips , i said
[483/1000]	she shook her head . " are n't you in love with me ? " " not in a romantic way , " he told her , kissing her cheek . " i do n't know if i 'm
[484/1000]	' why not just run down there , look for the kids when they are n't close ? ' ' because they 've abandoned the village , are n't they ? remember the old lady calling that place to
[485/1000]	" he says anything , he 'll say anything , " i told him . " you 're a smart woman . you can read his words , i just know it . " " you must ,
[486/1000]	" i am tired of killing people , of finding bodies in graves , and of trying to survive , " he said . " i am tired of waking up every day terrified to take another breath . "
[487/1000]	she blinked at that - then she focused on the black cloud above . " this is not a cloud . " the word came from far away . " have you seen it before ? " alex asked
[488/1000]	" thank you so much , " she said as she pulled the blanket up to her chin . " it 's my pleasure , " he replied smiling . " my name is blake hastings and we arrived
[489/1000]	" it 's not that easy , " he said , running his hand through his hair as he let his head fall back against the headrest and closed his eyes , as if surrendering to the inevitable . "
[490/1000]	" you should have listened . that 's all you needed to do . " he turned away from me to address leo . they did not speak , but stared at each other as if everything was on
[491/1000]	" if i told you it was coming so soon ? well , that 's how i feel . so what do you want ? " he asked again , more softly this time . i wondered what made
[492/1000]	i took a deep breath that did n't help . " i need to talk to my dad . i 'm sure you had the whole thing handled , but there 's something up with my mom , something that
[493/1000]	" so be it . " " one more thing . something about ... " " tell me . " " i just want you to know ... i admire you . i like you just the
[494/1000]	it was n't as easy to sleep before work as it was in the day , she reasoned . she 'd made it to her job at the center by night , <EOS> at night , in the morning
[495/1000]	i held my breath , so intent as to ignore his voice and his words . " <EOS> ... " he said it by making it seem . the word had a nice touch on my flesh .
[496/1000]	" you ready for your next move ? " jeremy asked . avon glared at jeremy . " are n't you going to ask what happened to the ice data ? " " i am , " jeremy
[497/1000]	" i will , sweetie . " aunt grace said . * * * " it says it 's a man that is dying , " said aunt grace . i could hear her crying beside the phone
[498/1000]	" i do n't , " mike said quietly . " or i wo n't . " i do n't want to leave . he 's only taken care of me . he 's never left me .
[499/1000]	" good idea , " she says from the bed . " let me get another gun . " " no ! " i shout at her , trying to get the door open . " do n't
[500/1000]	' it is always a shock to realize that i am a victim . ' his voice sounded dead , as if he had just awoken from a sudden sleep . ' though i rather feel so much gratitude .
[501/1000]	we waited until darkness fell . then we left that little corner where we discovered the back door , led him up the steps and down the garage stairs , and back to the car . his hand was
[502/1000]	" i do n't know what that means . " " what i do know is you do not exactly like his methods . " this was true . " do you think it 's not true
[503/1000]	he looked into her eyes again . " what happened ? " he asked . " you wanted the pleasure of her hand on you . i needed to get you off before she came out . "
[504/1000]	" it 's in your blood , remember ? " he smiled down at her , then turned his attention to logan . " the rest of us will be safe . i 've seen everything here , " he
[505/1000]	" okay , sure . i 'll give you a call tomorrow . i have to run , see the doctor . love you . " " love you , too . bye . " when she swung
[506/1000]	" he did , did n't he ? " " we were both so angry ... i do n't know <EOS> just spit on me , i 'm sure about this one . but he did . i 'm
[507/1000]	i shake my head . i do n't know what she wants . " where 's the bedroom ? " she points at it and i walk in . i walk away from it in the middle of the
[508/1000]	he pulls me in tighter but does n't respond , and his lips are to my ear . " they must want to know what 's going on with you . tell them , and they 'll never know the
[509/1000]	i just want to go home . chapter five logan i pull in front of the bowling alley and double - check the traffic in front of it before slipping my fingers behind my neck , giving
[510/1000]	that left no other options . there was something truly important she wanted to discuss with her sister , someone to confide in , someone to share confi dences with . but her family had already proven that they would
[511/1000]	" it 's what we do , " she said . he could n't get her over the words he needed to hear to tell her that . " then maybe you 'll be able to forgive me for
[512/1000]	" what if i want to share news with you ? " she paused . she almost thought she was imagining the comment , but it seemed to come from the floor at her feet . the woman at
[513/1000]	but it had n't exactly been a happy ending . in the first few seconds , the two demons had managed to get the most out of me , but afterward everything had gone to shit . i had
[514/1000]	' no , that 's not nice at all , ' i told him , ' you 've got to go and take care of this for yourself , ca n't you ? ' he went through to get
[515/1000]	his finger slid between her slick folds and he moved it up to touch her clit . " i want you so bad , " she panted , closing her eyes and squeezing her eyes with anticipation .
[516/1000]	" it 's not a lot , " she said , and even she hated it . " it ai n't much , but it 's what i got . it 's what i make with it . "
[517/1000]	he caught it just in time . the woman started screaming again , but then stopped abruptly , trying to make sense of the screams . " i do n't know ... " her gaze , though ,
[518/1000]	" because they were the last two men , " he answered , not un kindly . " they 're out there . " the silence on the island was even and not a little scary .
[519/1000]	" i hope everything 's okay . i know it 's in a box downstairs . would you mind putting your purse near the house ? " " of course not , " he said , running his hand
[520/1000]	" that 's great , " i gushed , delighted again . " it 's kind of a shame . " " hmm ? " he turned on me with his forehead crinkling . " you know .
[521/1000]	" do we have time ? " " yes , we 're in a long line outside the church . " he found her out in the hall ; she was talking to someone on the phone .
[522/1000]	by the time the truck came around the bend , the boys were no longer watching where they were going . " huh ? " richie asked . if he had looked or sounded confused , he had n't
[523/1000]	" yes - yes , of course ! " the woman grabbed her basket and ran back behind the counter , presumably for a book to distract mr. fo gle from the front room . " that 's all i
[524/1000]	" what did the baby say to you ? " she smiled , a flash of dimple catching her cheek . " i guess he called me fat . " her smile faded fast . " i mean
[525/1000]	she reached over and took his hand , her delicate fingers brushing the center of his palm . " not if you need me . " " are you sure ? " at that moment a figure crept
[526/1000]	" there was no need for you to come here . he will be much better off without you . " i look away , remembering the last time i gave her any sort of advice . " yeah
[527/1000]	" is that even possible ? " he turned to her and took off his helmet , pushing one curly red lock of hair behind her ear . " what is ? " " i do n't know
[528/1000]	" do n't answer that . have a good day at work . " with that he closed the door in the maid 's face . " that sounded like a nice man , " meg said when he
[529/1000]	" oh , i 'm sure you 'll be able to find them soon enough . " she leaned in and whispered something in my ear . i rolled my eyes and followed her to a picnic table by
[530/1000]	i just did n't want to ruin this " getting to know her " moment . " tell her i said hi . " ethan held the door open for me , and we carried on with our conversation
[531/1000]	" why should i understand what you 're doing ? " he gave her a rueful look . " yes . you 're my prisoner . i 'm your executioner . i 'm responsible for your safety and happiness
[532/1000]	he is a true human - and we are his progen y . that 's my job . " she let go and stepped away from him . " she 's not ready for this . she 's weak
[533/1000]	" yeah , " charlie said . " but you 're very much alive anyway , so that does n't make you a bad guy . i guess i just know how to deal with it . " i
[534/1000]	" i got it , " he choked out . " tell your guys you 're having some sort of flashback , so they 'll leave you alone . " he pulled out his cell phone , held it up
[535/1000]	" there 's no reason not to ! besides , " the girl added with a sly smile , " you ca n't stay in a hotel . as you must see , not all hotels are like these .
[536/1000]	" he 'll be all right . " though he would as soon as she left . his fingers left her breast , but only to trace them down the side of her neck , then up along her
[537/1000]	* * * it was so real that i could scarcely believe it . it was a dream , an old dream of mine , a dream of our mother being carried away . the sun rose over
[538/1000]	" you have gotten to me a bit . it seems we have some minor issues . i want to bring in some of my agents that we can use as backup against an enemy that might get close to
[539/1000]	" i do n't see anyone , " he said just as the door opened . " they 're staying in the lobby ! " he said in wonderment as he stepped back into the foyer . from somewhere
[540/1000]	" like i said , we just needed to find a way to live in this world and not have to sacrifice anything . do n't make that sacrifice for us like that . " " if i ever
[541/1000]	and he 'd actually done the right thing in trying to make her that vulnerable , one of his own kind . it was amazing he had n't broken her heart last time on purpose . not over his
[542/1000]	to do with as i please . " " yes , " she said . * * * i told her i would be in friday night just until late friday night . " okay ,
[543/1000]	in another city , surrounded by white stone walls , her family was the center of a whole world of strangeness . a human child would have enjoyed this , would have enjoyed every moment of it . what she
[544/1000]	i sighed and nodded , " if the end result is the most desirable outcome , then yeah . " i glanced over at ben . he was gazing at the ground , too , seemingly mesmerized . "
[545/1000]	" yeah , it 's that . " " there 's a chance that it had something to do with the car . they must have been listening to it . we 'd better go back and check on
[546/1000]	but it was n't exactly as that . it was what happened to her and it made him feel empty inside . then there was the man who had forced him down the toilet once . a man who had
[547/1000]	" you tell me , when i 'm gone , how do i not go off to school and have a full day of what to do to prepare for my party ? " i said . he laughed
[548/1000]	" no , " i said automatically . i was n't going to deny it . my words were soft and tentative . " i honestly ca n't answer that question . " " so i 'll guess ,
[549/1000]	but no matter if he was right or wrong , he knew he was right . she 'd been waiting for him , her dark hair gleaming with moisture , her gray eyes alive , a longing in her expression
[550/1000]	' you ca n't go around doing what you want , ' said mr sa vel oy . ' we all 've got a right to our dreams or we 're never going to stand up for what we 're
[551/1000]	then he remembered her mentioning how she had known him - and that a good man did n't try to be the best in the world for a woman 's sake . " i 'm sorry . " she
[552/1000]	" you mean that i should go hide in some room and get murdered ? " " exactly , how many times do i have to tell you ? i 'm not one of those vampires who would die
[553/1000]	" of course . so of course he had it covered . " " did he tell you if it was as simple as his choice to sacrifice the others ? " " of course . " she
[554/1000]	i made my way outside on the sidewalk , staring . it was raining heavily . so damned hard that i had to push over the sidewalk rail and stumble down the road . i threw open the heavy iron
[555/1000]	" did i <EOS> ? " he asked , but said nothing . " you know a man named ro ark ? " she asked . " yes , and there is two . " after a moment
[556/1000]	" let 's go to the house , " he said abruptly , going to his truck . i could hear the sound of the engine starting but was too panicked to tell how much . " we need to
[557/1000]	the four of them walked to my car and climbed in , my mom started it and we both started backing out of the shop quickly . my father jumped on the gas , still ranting . " that
[558/1000]	" not just that , " she finally said . " he may have been one of your clients . " grace felt an instant chill . with all the other clients , it never seemed possible that she
[559/1000]	she pulled his arm again and tugged him inside . the hallway was dark and creepy by the light of the hallway . " this way , " she whispered close to his ear . when they were in
[560/1000]	" what could do that ? " anna asked , knowing it was wrong to ask . " it could not hurt , " the woman said . she placed a hand on anna 's , " are
[561/1000]	my heart suddenly beat faster . " not here ; it 's a hotel . " " i see . " he nodded and turned at the sound of the door opening . i froze , with my arms
[562/1000]	" i know a lot of those are real , " he says , sliding to the floor and pulling her out of her chair . her arm is in his , and her head rests in his lap
[563/1000]	" all right , all right , " he said . " i 'll do my best to have the next one delivered . " it happened within thirty minutes . a white envelope went to the security guard
[564/1000]	" is that an ad monition , ms. lar oc que ? " jessica stared at him and the color rose in her cheeks . she stared back , and the rest of the team seemed to grow taut
[565/1000]	" yeah ? what for ? " " her father threatened her . told her there would be no talking to her dad . told her as if that should have guaranteed she would have no friends ! that
[566/1000]	he took the water bottle and carefully poured a little on her forehead when she raised her head . " i 'll get the first cold shower i can get you . " " it 's not going
[567/1000]	" you can ? " the thought of it made her shudder . " i do n't know what to say . " her throat was thick and wet . she blinked at him in surprise and his gaze
[568/1000]	" i do not want to . " she went back to her packing . " then kiss me . " " no . " " i will . " " you will not . "
[569/1000]	all the time , he had been thinking about how he would kill ty ka , the girl he loved . ty ka 's death would make him vulnerable to ad re ea h ben wah and ad re
[570/1000]	" that 's right , " said peter , sounding both sad and resigned . " i 'll stay a few days . i promise . " " then i 'll take her there , " said bodo without
[571/1000]	" we are fine . they took it from us without <EOS> more than a vague impression of their intent . " i felt a strange sense of shame and guilt at their actions . " i should
[572/1000]	" she 's still married , " he stated . he sounded like a father talking to a child . i should have been mad at him and his father for speaking to me this way . i
[573/1000]	the first three people to arrive were girls at least twenty years his senior , in the middle of the morning as the first light of morning touched the eastern horizon . as the main body of visitors filtered in
[574/1000]	" i still do n't understand . " i stared at him in confusion . " why did n't you take me to the hospital ? why was n't i in the er ? " " i would never
[575/1000]	it is about the twelfth day of my captivity and i feel tired and out of sorts . i do not know how long i 've been in the cells , but i do n't care . my face
[576/1000]	" what would you say , sweetheart ? " i teased . " tell them i was thinking about ... having sex with you , " she said with a wink . i stood there and tried not
[577/1000]	" i felt like i was the one that had to fight my feelings . " his voice almost cracked as he said that . " i 'm sorry . " " do n't be sorry . it
[578/1000]	the next morning , she checked the list of meetings he had scheduled with the other guys , checking the clock on the wall clock , making sure that they had everything right . at eleven o'clock she started making
[579/1000]	" it 's a big town , " he said . " most folks are already out and about these days . i never know who 's been here . a lot gets a little busy . i remember getting
[580/1000]	" yeah , " i said . " so ? " i was about to ask who she was when she ran up to us and said , " hi . i 've missed you . " i
[581/1000]	" you only just got here before we got you , " mom protested , and nick shrugged , refusing to elaborate . the conversation switched gears , and as i watched her finish her second glass of wine ,
[582/1000]	she pulled her hand out and smiled up at him . " you 'll have to excuse me , i 've got a lot on my mind right now . " he smiled back and set to work on
[583/1000]	there was a long silence , and he could feel his breath catch faster as he fought back the surge of emotion . the boy felt anything but comfortable around him , and now he knew why . he
[584/1000]	" hi , " my father said to me as he walked up the stairs . " hey , dad , " i said . " how was the drive ? " he asked . " you
[585/1000]	" i 'll have the driver bring it around . i do n't want to wait until one . just sit tight , doc , " carl said through the mouthpiece . as the car neared the intersection outside
[586/1000]	" that 's why she has the address below . " said mrs. givens . she had just gotten the phone call from pete that john got from you . he is getting back into his swing with his school
[587/1000]	" you really think he would never tell me all that ? " " i told him i had a confession , " the cop answered . " how did you get it ? " the cop
[588/1000]	his name was on her lips - her mouth that was going to be used against him , even if he did n't realize it . and she was so hungry for the taste of him that she had n't
[589/1000]	he turned to the captain , and said , " captain , i thought you told us that we were lost ? " " after all , a ship like this should be able to follow its own course
[590/1000]	" no , i 'm not interested in either of them . " i laughed at the absurdity of the situation . " god , you 're ridiculous . " " really , you think so ? " he
[591/1000]	he did n't move fast enough to catch her as she dodged past him . he had n't wanted to , but he had n't been able to think to do anything else . he had to get away
[592/1000]	" i 'm not married , " she snapped , reaching for her drink . " well , what are you doing here ? " he had n't expected her to be alone , but he had n't expected
[593/1000]	" well , i 'm sure you can , " he said , taking a small piece of paper and a pen from his desk . " really ? " " really . i 'm going to do
[594/1000]	" is that all ? " he raises an eyebrow . " yeah , but do you realize what awaits me if i fail to obey ? " " i think it 's clear that you intend to
[595/1000]	" she is no one 's dog , " said the other . " so am i , " said a thin faced woman in a short , pale dress , a little above the knee . " so
[596/1000]	" let her go , " i growl . " you have her ! i 'm not letting you go . i want out of this place . " " you 're a fool . you do n't
[597/1000]	" tell me about my grandfather , " i said . " he is dead , " she said . " dead and gone . and he was n't always that way . it 's a long story ,
[598/1000]	" the way i see it is one of its great advantages . " " i 'm not sure i understand what you 're getting at , manny . " " tell me , manny , will it
[599/1000]	he caught her wrist with his strong fingers and pulled her down to him for a kiss . " not likely . i like a woman with spirit . " the woman was all smiles . they took
[600/1000]	for twenty minutes , i spent my time between shifts , typing , listening to music , eating , and trying to forget . but every once in a while , i would catch sight of sebastian . my world
[601/1000]	" do you have to do that ? " " do what ? " " write and write things . " " oh , for that . " i glared at him . " do n't know
[602/1000]	" i am a terrible person . there is no other reason for what i have done . " " so so , you plan to change that ? " chris inquired softly . cassie 's eyes flared
[603/1000]	she looked at him . " and ? " he nodded before closing the door to the office . " i thought the two of you could get acquainted . " " i have something else to do
[604/1000]	" that is not her , " the woman said softly . " it is more , if i may say so myself . she is small , quite delicate . " " what 's right is , "
[605/1000]	" tell me what you saw , " he said again , more insistently . " nothing <EOS> - just some tree - shadows , " she said . " some strange things - " " i know
[606/1000]	" so you 'd rather be in new york or london than here . " she was silent for a moment . " i 'm interested in moving in with you whenever i can . " " of
[607/1000]	her tone was cold and sharp as she asked , " what did you think had happened to her ? " " nothing . i thought he was murdered , you know . it was horrible what she -
[608/1000]	he did not want to . he did n't want to make love to her . he felt her warmth and felt her tiny frame shivering against him . once they were touching , she had no choice .
[609/1000]	" i wish . let 's order something so i can eat . " " i have a favorite chinese restaurant , so , let 's take one the two blocks over to golden gate park and sit under
[610/1000]	" actually no . the three of us are going to see one of the ladies ' in a few hours . " my dad looked at me as if i had lost my mind . " girls !
[611/1000]	" what do we care ? " the guy at the table said . " that 's a dumb story anyway . " " yeah , but who cares ? " i said . " your dad was here
[612/1000]	then i did exactly what she did . i let go of the knife , and my fingers snaked out and took hold of the blade . it bit into fletcher 's palm . i sucked in
[613/1000]	" they 're both beautiful , " i admitted , pushing the hair away from her face . it was a strange feeling , being held by someone like kellan . he was such a safe person , but never
[614/1000]	" you should . " " no . i want to help . this is what i been doing for the last three years . i have work to do . i have to help you . okay ?
[615/1000]	" did the same to the man who attacked us . " " you ca n't be serious ? " she 'd moved to the other side of the bed on one side of him and wrapped her arms
[616/1000]	" no problem . please send it through . i 'll be there in an hour . " the lady sighed . " she 's on my flight as planned . have a nice day , little girl .
[617/1000]	he said he had to speak to you now , and he left right away . " i shake my head sadly . ' twas only for one , i think , but i think it was the best
[618/1000]	" oh , no , i 'm fine . i just need a minute to get the bottle of wine . " " there 's a bottle of chardonnay in the cupboard and some wine bottles . "
[619/1000]	she was sure it was n't her imagination . " i do n't have any more clothes right now , but my sister and i are heading out in two days . " " and what are your plans
[620/1000]	and before i could grab her arm and pull her downstairs to this small kitchen , lanie brought her gaze back to me and stared , wide - eyed , mouth parted . " i liked the dress ,
[621/1000]	the new queen of the elves , a woman with the most fearsome , un compromising face - the woman ta mon had never quite seen - rose , her long , flowing black hair falling into her face .
[622/1000]	he laughed . " at least i 'm not the total opposite of an animal 's body . " " hey , what 's your favorite color ? " the voice came , cold and flat , at the
[623/1000]	it was after ten o'clock in the evening , and i was still asleep when the phone rang . in one of our little habits here at the library , we worked through the night like animals , even
[624/1000]	" you know , if life were a movie , i 'd think it had some good lines , too , " i said , trying to forget my awkward crush on the professor . " but sometimes , you
[625/1000]	' i 'm sure they 'll take care of it . the problem is you 'll owe them . ' ' that 's true . that 's why the police are doing this . i can see it too
[626/1000]	he took in a sharp breath , but continued on into the main room . the only furniture in the room was the one he stood in when he 'd entered the room . the view of the deck
[627/1000]	" he did n't say anything about being a member of the club , " pussy said , looking at tiny . " did you really think he 'd go up against f * * king gash if you
[628/1000]	" is that so ? " his face took on a familiar expression , one i did not like . " so you expect me to believe whatever happens up there ? " " uh , yeah , i
[629/1000]	" i am so grateful . at least he 's getting a job . and i thank you for everything . " i feel bad , but i just do n't know how to express how much that meant to
[630/1000]	" you are n't supposed to ask questions , claire , " he said quietly . " that is n't the way to treat a soldier . " " i know . but this boy would n't just sleep
[631/1000]	but i know i 'm the only one willing to give that up . we stand face - to - face in the pool . our breaths are deep and erratic . he wipes the back of his hand
[632/1000]	and then the first line of a verse was read in the bottom right hand corner of the box . it 's easy , said her mother . it 's just a thought . there was nothing to
[633/1000]	he saw her hand . she opened her palm . for a moment , he actually saw her skin glow faintly silver - green . then her eyes were gone . black that vanished and left only the same blank
[634/1000]	" now get the hell out of my space , or i swear , i 'm going to shoot you right here , and since you are n't doing it with the hand gun , you are probably still under
[635/1000]	now he looks down at my mouth , and he licks his own lips . i swallow and do n't move for a moment . what the f * * k - what did i just do ? and
[636/1000]	" when i am not working , i do my research on the matter , " ma hon said . " i want to know why we needed you . when i say you are a danger that threatens curran
[637/1000]	a smile stretched across his face as if he might be having a good time . after all , everything was so out of place here . especially his clothes . they were so stiff and un coordinated . they
[638/1000]	" i 'll be okay with you going back to your place , " she said . " i do n't regret it , sarah . " " then go to work , " she said , pushing
[639/1000]	" that sounds nice , " he said , looking very relieved with me . " did you come from around here ? " despite the questions and the lies , my stomach flipped as i thought of my
[640/1000]	" so what do you think ? " she asked . " it 's still really early ... no reason for me to be here in the morning . " " i 'm looking forward to it .
[641/1000]	david stepped in front of me and stepped back . " you have n't seen the view . " he looked right at me . " not a clue . " i walked over to his sofa , not
[642/1000]	" there 's an area just north of my office that is usually isolated and private , " jack said , his voice tinged with suspicion . they entered the building 's main lobby . two men , dressed
[643/1000]	it seemed the answer would only require a moment to speak . i will remember it , he thought . there was something quite strange about the way she spoke , perhaps because it was a speech she
[644/1000]	" if i think you 're wasting your time with me , mr. kent , then i should n't have asked . " i kept my focus on my coffee . i did n't want to break eye contact with
[645/1000]	both of them looked over to where he had placed the book on the floor in the center , and in the dim light , he saw the symbols of the council on a silver chain . " what
[646/1000]	as the room emptied , max remained by the door . he was still wearing his green satin pajamas . " let me help you clean , " i said . i wrapped a towel around his body and
[647/1000]	" god , no , " i groan in horror . " you do n't say . i knew i should n't have agreed to go see you after all . i 'm so sorry , " i apologize in
[648/1000]	while i was in my house , i noticed i had a couple of messages from my dad . not that it stopped me - i had an entire family that wanted me there , as i was the one
[649/1000]	' i 'm sure i do . ' she picked up a bowl that held peanuts . ' do n't try to avoid me ? ' she said . she sat on the bed and the lights went
[650/1000]	" my thanks . " " when i was young i always liked you . " " thanks . " " and that 's all the time we 'll have for ourselves . " " have
[651/1000]	you did n't have to . and the next time i saw you ... i 'd know if you were still a virgin . you 're the most beautiful woman i 've ever seen . and the fact that i
[652/1000]	" where did you get it ? " ian demanded , incredulous . " did something happen to it ? " ian demanded , his face going dark with rage . " for me and ian , yes
[653/1000]	" you 've been down . " " and the kid at the counter ? " " i believe he was probably the victim . i do n't think he had a choice . from what i was
[654/1000]	" yeah , man . " " uh , not all , " mike replied and i looked to him . " what 's up ? " " well , i was thinkin ' , you and me
[655/1000]	" no , baby , no f * * king way . i will not do that . i will not hurt you . is that clear ? " she nodded , feeling unbelievably safe . " i
[656/1000]	" why did you say that ? " " because my father told me not to ask questions . " she took the key from his hand and unlocked the door to his condo . a moment later ,
[657/1000]	' i 'm not supposed to . ' ' please tell me what i must do , ' said ridcully . the dean ran to the floor , picked up his staff and pointed it at susan 's
[658/1000]	" i can barely breathe , " he breathed . " i ca n't breathe anymore . it 's bad , avery . please , please let me die . stop the bleeding . please , no more . "
[659/1000]	" oh , sweetie . " she put her arms around him . a few moments later and he was back at my side . " we 're okay . " we were fine , my parents and me
[660/1000]	now they 're both watching me , waiting . does they think i 'm going to do something stupid ? because i am . " she has some crazy shit , " i say suddenly , looking at
[661/1000]	the king returned to the bed . " i 'd be happy to offer you an evening to recuperate or to recuperate , but right now i 'm more interested in having my guards escort you about so you do
[662/1000]	" do n't have your problems , " i say defensively , and quickly slap my hand over my mouth as his laughter fills the tent . " and by the way , i think you need to tell
[663/1000]	how had this happened ? how had he been able to keep a hand in the darkness ? as silently as i could , i crept across the house and quietly locked the door behind me . but before
[664/1000]	sam gave him the first smile he 'd ever given him , if not since getting the license plate number in his own vehicle . a few minutes later , he took sam 's directions and then called in
[665/1000]	" as i would say , you 've got it all wrong . you see , it took a little bit of convincing to bring a full marriage into existence . what you need to do is try to make
[666/1000]	some things are better left in the past , some are more important . and some things better left in the future , be they good or terrible . you just can not change them . especially not not with
[667/1000]	" that would go for me too , " he agreed , " but he did want me to take my time learning how to do the kind of magic you 've got that does things to a person like
[668/1000]	i looked over to jason who sat looking down at me with his goofy grin , " are you blushing ? you look like a schoolgirl . " i laughed and shook my head " do n't be a
[669/1000]	" no , " he growls . " it is for a good reason . " his cock slides onto my thigh and slips even deeper . " that 's the problem , baby , you have nothing . no
[670/1000]	he made a gesture indicating that she should precede him . " go on . " closing her eyes for a moment , she breathed in deeply to calm herself . when she opened her eyes again , she
[671/1000]	i could n't hold out much longer . i would n't have the self - restraint to handle it . but i was n't ready to give him up . because the whole world , including our mother
[672/1000]	" when do i get to be a new house ? " i asked . " when you 're a big girl . " " i hope that 's true , " i joked dryly . "
[673/1000]	" my lady ? " she paused , then said , " i realize you are no longer the same person . and there is nothing you can do to stop me . " " but still i
[674/1000]	on day seven - and one day last year - i woke up alone in my bed . i was sure that i 'd dreamt the nightmare before and had finally come to the end , and while i
[675/1000]	" that 's my son , " i said , pointing a finger at him . " only a child . do you remember me ? " i recognized him instantly . this man , he reminded me of
[676/1000]	" will this help ? " she asks , pulling back . " what if it makes your eyes pop ? " i ask , frowning . " i ca n't help it . " " sure
[677/1000]	" why did n't i know that this evening was bad ? " " why were n't you here ? " she dropped her head and looked him in the eye . she expected the question and she
[678/1000]	" what ! how could you ? " the man stepped forward . i froze inside the apartment , wishing i did n't exist . " why were you ... fucking with me ? " he yelled .
[679/1000]	she was standing in the shadows , her arms crossed over her chest , and she was looking up at a man several feet up that disappeared into the ceiling in the second - story room . there were shadows
[680/1000]	david , you and i both know there will be . oh , it has been a long time since i 've had that taste . not in a good way , i know . the more i spend
[681/1000]	" you 're going to wake the girl , " mark said . " she 's not going to stand in the shower for the next hour or so , and then go get dressed . she 's not coming
[682/1000]	they got to the party and , sure enough , there were lots of couples dancing . i got us a table and two chairs along with some fruit and dessert , and some drink . they handed some beer
[683/1000]	" you 've done a fantastic job so far , " mr. i paris continued . " now when it 's your turn to start , keep the right eye . " mr. i paris gave shane a thumbs up
[684/1000]	no one could believe she had agreed to take the children on , considering what a disaster they would be facing once they fell on the hard concrete , crushed by the impact . but , thinking of those
[685/1000]	but i could tell by his tone which trouble he still found himself in , that he did not anticipate my response . nor would he expect me to agree . " how did it happen ? " i
[686/1000]	chapter 4 , the last chapter my first week is spent in portland trying to write on my blog . first book in the series : the coming of the guardians 2 . earth - shattering (
[687/1000]	she hesitated at his bed . there were lots of secrets in this house . she 'd learned about his past . and she 'd learned about his mother . he made a sound of pleasure when she
[688/1000]	" who would ever have thought somebody as brilliant as me would be so stupid ? " she was n't one to listen , at least , not at first . " how did you get wind of what
[689/1000]	' that <EOS> ' she was back , i could see the sun . ' i love to see her make a pattern . ' not only the other night , although he had seen , then come inside
[690/1000]	it had to be . " what happened to the cops ? " she whispered . " she got away . " he turned to face her . " and you 're going after her ? "
[691/1000]	chapter 3 the man inside came running through the door . he 'd jumped out at them , looking like a child whose world had just been flipped upside down , with dirt smeared through his hair and clothes
[692/1000]	" yeah , i see , then why did a lot of people want your money ? " well , you never know , you may find out on the way here , since my friend joe 's eyes
[693/1000]	then all of a sudden and seemingly out of nowhere i could hear thomas 's voice : " you 're not helping us , thomas . i told you before - and i still get it - we have
[694/1000]	i was having lunch with my brother the night before in his suite at the tower . with my parents and the men downstairs , at the cocktail party where they 'd been talking about the big promotion they
[695/1000]	" she 's right . " i had been so focused on that kiss that i had n't noticed adrian had stepped behind me . i 'd taken the step backward so that our faces were almost touching , and
[696/1000]	" you said i was weak and that just because i had sex with rick did n't make him weak . " " you said he was weak in so many ways . you said he was n't like
[697/1000]	" a pity you have n't brought a camera , " she said . then , for good measure , she added , " though i am sure we could find another in the area . " he did
[698/1000]	" one hundred men ! we need a man of the village ! " he screamed . the priest went to speak as the horse galloped on ahead through a rolling field of wheat , then he turned to
[699/1000]	he 'd had the last two days to feel some sort of peace again . not even from what the demon had told her he 'd done to him , even as a demon . " this ends
[700/1000]	" i did n't mean to make you feel bad , " his voice was deep and husky . " no you did n't , " she said . " but i did n't realize that until ... i
[701/1000]	' i would rather not get involved with you so quickly , ' said tristram . ' i ca n't help thinking it 's better if you take a little time to think things over first . ' the
[702/1000]	' we wo n't die , ' he said . his tone turned almost flat . ' but - ' ' we will , ' his father said quietly , and began to move off . without pausing
[703/1000]	" can i borrow your toothbrush ? " i ask . " sure , " he grumbles in protest . i just laugh as he gets up and heads for the other bathroom . sighing , i go
[704/1000]	" i 'm just having a good time , " she repeated . " you sure ? you do n't look good . you have a lot on your mind . do n't you think ? " she
[705/1000]	" oh <EOS> " - " they do n't want the first one , " " oh there 's no need , " only to be followed by the most important sign for the camera ... " why
[706/1000]	" as opposed to what ? " " to seeing the back of a chair , " he said , and closed his eyes . " does n't that hurt your feelings ? " " nothing hurts
[707/1000]	" you 'll see , " she returned . " you have not forgotten . " he felt her eyes on him , too restless to enjoy the sensation and took some time to assess the situation , but
[708/1000]	even with the high ceiling above , the room was lit by a few feeble orange light bulbs , which he would n't be able to properly appreciate until he was <EOS> even more sure . oh , it had
[709/1000]	" i do n't know what they gave into her hunger , but it needs her strength for what she does next . " " and what do you plan to do about it ? " jake gave
[710/1000]	" you will take care of your own . you can be with me whenever you need to , i promise . " he kissed me and said , " i 'll take care of anything that bothers you
[711/1000]	but as of this evening , no one dares come to the castle to watch <EOS> , because there 're all the children of the slaves . well , as if the only young man on the front lawn
[712/1000]	" please , " he whispers , " do n't . " and in that , he leaves me and walks to a couple of the women where he introduces them , then comes back with a bottle of wine
[713/1000]	her breathing slowed and she sat up , brushing her hair out of her face . " that 's why i could n't admit that it 's not you . it 's the way it 's going to be ,
[714/1000]	" i hope i will see you at supper tonight , " he told her as the door closed behind her . in her bedroom in the guest wing , grace was lying in bed , holding a quilt
[715/1000]	i 'm sure you are sure , the voice of a lady voice sounded in my head . i felt a pleasant wave of emotions wash over me at that moment . it had been so long since anyone had
[716/1000]	" and this is your friend ? " he asked , nodding to a woman who was walking past with one foot in the air . " yes . " " ah , then this is laura 's
[717/1000]	" maybe i do that for you . i 'm a jerk . " " well , you 're not getting a cent for your trouble . if you 're still here by lunch , you can pick up
[718/1000]	and then when she finally felt the warmth of his tongue as he rolled it over her clit , she did n't want to wait any longer . she closed her eyes and tried to remember where she was
[719/1000]	and like a miracle , she obeyed . it did n't take long to get home , where she showered and changed to find that jake had done a load of laundry . on the table lay a pile
[720/1000]	" now you look at me , sir . be careful . " " careful ? " the clerk tried to smile but it did n't work . " who are you anyway ? " " my
[721/1000]	" do you , " i croak , " do you ever just go away ? " he looks startled . " leave where ? " " all of your life . " he shakes his head
[722/1000]	" your boss has it locked up tight . " his frown deepened . " why ? " " i do n't know , he 's just ... i do n't know . he just told me to
[723/1000]	" oh ? because you 've been seeing our enemy ? what 's it take you to do that , anyway ? " " me ? " he glanced her way , and her stomach did a weird flip
[724/1000]	one or two would probably come out of each of them , but you could n't trust them . none of the other team could . they all understood the rules of covert ops . a man could n't shoot
[725/1000]	" and you should n't have any more kids . even if you ca n't hold a baby . " she shrugged . " i just ca n't go there anymore . i 've been so busy with things
[726/1000]	" did your friend ... have a - " i bit my tongue . " no , he did n't - please , " she interrupted , taking my hand in hers . she was so beautiful and strong
[727/1000]	i looked on as the sun set , seeing people in the area . when sam stepped inside , his eyes were dark , <EOS> in his mind watching people , not a body . like sam 's friend ,
[728/1000]	there she was , having just finished her dinner of raw fish and the best of bread on the whole coast . what was it with fishermen ? that was the problem with the human race . they would
[729/1000]	" i 'm not sure they believe me . they say they 're the best . i said i 'd tell them when they got back . i wanted to be sure . <EOS> even if they get here ,
[730/1000]	i could n't allow this to end . it was as real as if we 'd spent our whole lives apart . but i was n't talking . i 'm talking , i was talking about me .
[731/1000]	" yes and yes . they killed your mother and grandfather . " " i know . " i almost laughed at him . " but there is more to the story . you know that we found
[732/1000]	it was just a matter of time before someone realized the danger she was in , and the timing was perfect . she was n't even thinking clearly when the next round of explosions rocked the earth in the alley
[733/1000]	" a human ? you mean like us ? and that you had the misfortune of hearing her voice , too ? of having her , too ? " " yes . you see , it was in my
[734/1000]	" what does that mean ? " i swallowed , suddenly feeling cold . " well , it means that you look as good as you do now . " she threw a glance at us and then
[735/1000]	' at least i hope not . ' ' is it what i 've noticed ? ' he took her hand . ' it 's the same kind of hair , ' she said , pointing down at
[736/1000]	i just stared at this beautiful , loving , beautiful thing . i had the best of both worlds . just then , i felt someone squeeze my hand making me turn my head and look down to
[737/1000]	" where is he ? " i yelled , frantically trying to see what my father was doing . " you have to tell him ! " her teeth were chattering , and not just from the cold .
[738/1000]	" it 's something i did . i 've worked hard to build it up . " " i guess so . hey , do you want to get ready for the party before we get there ? "
[739/1000]	' how much longer ? ' asked sam . ' almost an hour , ' answered aragorn . ' but by that hour i am afraid he will most surely reach the ford the black bridge is on .
[740/1000]	" what did she say later ? " " i guess , " i said , taking a sip and a sip of the whisky . " that she was getting married and that she did n't want to
[741/1000]	" i ... i 'm in love with you , peter . " his voice was small and filled with doubt , and i cringed , knowing that every syllable he spoke was telling him that he did n't believe
[742/1000]	" we 're very nearly at its front door , " said the leader . " to the right of it is the entrance to the great hall . we have no weapons . we have no help . "
[743/1000]	he turned her toward him . " do n't . i do not want to see this . never see this . " " and do you want to , lucien ? " she asked softly . " that
[744/1000]	" yes . he is only five months older than himself , which is why he ca n't walk yet ! " the man leaned into the room and placed his elbows on the table . " how do you
[745/1000]	" so you ca n't hurt herself ? " " i know what i 'm doing . " " what do you think , boss ? " " i think she 's under a little strain right
[746/1000]	" here it is , " i said softly , handing him the little box , and the faintest glow began to draw closer . it had the letters " g " scrawled across the top , and an
[747/1000]	the sun is higher when i pull up to the house . it 's a huge colonial style house with a high , white picket fence . i 'm not sure it has much beauty in it , but that
[748/1000]	she had told me once , a long time ago , that no one had ever loved her more , and perhaps i had n't come to that conclusion myself , but i did n't ask any questions at that
[749/1000]	" he keeps to himself during the day . " " why does n't he come out with me ? " " i do n't think he does . " i could hear his frustration in his voice
[750/1000]	" and the point ? " " well , i just wonder if i 've made a mistake with you . you know , you 've been spending a lot of time with me , and i have begun
[751/1000]	it was a mistake . i should have left her with me , back at the house , but i wanted to stay with her last night and then this morning , and that should have been the plan .
[752/1000]	" no , " said joseph . " this is not a matter of survival . at least not now , especially my own . i must move on . " " you have always been afraid , have
[753/1000]	" wait ? " i question . he looks at me as i sit down on the edge of my bed where i was standing before , and i immediately feel really wrong . i 'm sure they 'll know
[754/1000]	" the sun ? " james looked at her with disbelief . " what 's that got to do with anything , miss ? " julia smiled sheepishly . " i did n't realize i was standing there
[755/1000]	" i am the first , " she murmurs , then looks up into my eyes while shaking her head in disbelief . " my parents are not who we think they are , especially my one and only biological
[756/1000]	he opened the door and headed straight out . he had to get to the library , had to go to the library . he stopped before his house and turned back through it three times to make sure
[757/1000]	and i will have to fix my own problem . a lump forms in my chest . the feeling you have when you 're told a lie . and me , i guess . i 'm all
[758/1000]	he did not speak ; he stared into space for several moments . " i am , " he said . they had come to a large cavern . there was a bright light , and a man in
[759/1000]	she glared at me . " what does your daughter call you ? " " i am what my daughter calls you . " her nostrils flared . " do not ever hurt a hair on her head .
[760/1000]	both men stepped back , their weapons up . " jesus , you guys all right ? " asked kyle . " we should probably be going , " said ernest . " so far , so good
[761/1000]	" you should have . the question is , did you think i 'd feel the same way ? " she would , but there was an odd hollow ness in her chest now . a hollow ness she
[762/1000]	but a moment later , the doorbell rang . i went to answer it . i had n't even put my phone away . i opened the door to an anonymous man in an olive green t - shirt
[763/1000]	do you forget something ? your friends ? do you forget - so i kept him standing there , immobile , and then i gave him the tip of my pencil and said , ' i was there ,
[764/1000]	" and , of course , they 've decided to share most of our food . " at this point they heard a loud laugh come from several different places at once . even jack was lost in the
[765/1000]	he 's in my bed , and so long as we have sex , i 'm just his kid sister . i know that , but my body is my own inside his . he 's like my own personal
[766/1000]	" you are a very strong man , master , " said the girl . " i wish you could have seen yourself . " " so i do . i wish i could have known who you are
[767/1000]	that night , they got into bed . she leaned over him , her breasts softly pressed against his chest , her mouth on his ear . " is n't it wonderful ? " he asked softly .
[768/1000]	he looked at the clock . 7: 30 . it was the hour and the meeting would begin that evening . he had promised the two people on that call for a short chat that morning .
[769/1000]	" you ca n't even pull it up ? " " no , just like i ca n't pull this thing up before . " he pulls on yet another lever that makes the control panel go with a
[770/1000]	and when i mentioned the fact that i had seen her several times before , she said , " oh , that poor girl . i 'm so sorry . i should have called ... " i smiled .
[771/1000]	" you got lucky , " she continued . " i saw you when i was cooking breakfast at the diner . your mom said you were back in town and you were fine . " " it was
[772/1000]	when the bell rang , she headed outside and into the courtyard , where the sun was no longer bright . she crossed the cobble stoned street to the public library and sat down to work on her thesis .
[773/1000]	" i think that 's enough , " said kor . " there 's plenty of time later . " with another long kiss , she gathered her things and left with a little more poise than was necessary .
[774/1000]	" how do you know so much about my life ? " he said . she shrugged . " you told me about my childhood . how i passed away , what i did , where , when and
[775/1000]	but if we move , the enemy will reach us before we make it out of sight . i 've heard the stories of the soldiers who got captured and thrown from ships a thousand miles away . only
[776/1000]	she swallowed hard as her gaze swept over the familiar figure that stood below . " hi . " " hi . " he drew her into a bear hug and kissed the top of her head . she
[777/1000]	" how did you know i was alive ? " she asked . " your voice had been all over the news . they released my name and were n't close to me at the time . "
[778/1000]	and then it was gone , leaving me numb and the only sound i could hear was one of the wind chimes rattling and rattling in the back of the room . chapter two i woke up when
[779/1000]	my eyes darted around the lobby . there was only one other man here other than mr. solomon , a man who wore a dark suit and his face was all pale pale white with an empty socket for a
[780/1000]	" good . " he went back to talking to his driver , who seemed to have forgotten all about me . " i 'm going to talk to the manager , " i said to mom and
[781/1000]	" ah , well , " she said , clearly unhappy with the answer . " if he really is your father , then i must speak to him about ... the other matter . " she frowned disapprovingly .
[782/1000]	" so that 's what happened ? " " yes . " he felt his face growing warm at the realization , but he just nodded . she went quiet . " and you had sex with a
[783/1000]	" we must . " " i do n't care . " he smiled . " maybe you should . " i got into bed and he looked around . " where are we ? "
[784/1000]	* * * that afternoon i went to school . today , i went out to lunch . i saw my friends at his coffee shop across the way . they were all smiling and pointing out happy lines
[785/1000]	ian 's voice had echoed through my head . " but for ian , you could write this thing at ease , should you go to scotland . " " well , you seem to be doing that ,
[786/1000]	" no , mother , <EOS> i 've got to make something myself . " " why about me ? " " because i have to do something . " " i can help . "
[787/1000]	' good evening , ma'am , thank you again for granting me service at this hour . i 'll leave you for now . ' he rose , left , and returned to the party . ' i 'll
[788/1000]	i love you so much . " " you , too . " she sighed . her expression became stern . " we can talk about this tonight . but first let 's get you into a
[789/1000]	" yes , " i say simply . " good , but i would n't ever expect you to forget , " francesca says . " or remember , for that matter . " i swallow hard .
[790/1000]	" what did you say to miss car u thers this morning ? " charlie asked . " that she should keep digging . was n't very successful . " " she 's not to be trusted .
[791/1000]	" he killed two more of them ! so now you 're no better than your brother did , " said simon . " and maybe you should have run for cover because you 're too much of a coward
[792/1000]	' what are you talking about ? ' ' the doctor says we 're too weak to travel in the ship ; that we 're too weakened to hold a conversation . and we 're still half drunk .
[793/1000]	" i do n't ask you to do anything . " " i 'm warning you , " she said in a cold , icy tone . " you can stop doing it . " " i 'm
[794/1000]	" i thought so , too , " i say , putting a hand on my hip when he slips out . he leans forward , resting his elbows on his knees . " good , " he says
[795/1000]	if she had stayed on the island , this whole mess would have been over , but she preferred to stay here and wait for her friends . and if he wanted her to stay , she would .
[796/1000]	but neither would give up . when i realized she was not on the other side of the door anymore , and that the only sounds i could hear were my heavy breathing and the ticking of a hot lamp
[797/1000]	" go ahead and show her with her parents . i sure hope it does n't take long . " and i thought i was getting old . i made the big decision right after he left that
[798/1000]	not just by your behavior - she 'd just wanted to put out all the people leaving . besides , she would rather be alone and think about what she 'd learned than in him . " hello
[799/1000]	he reached across her and took a fistful of hair , pushing her head back down so their eyes meet . " what do you want ? " he teased . " you . " she pointed to his
[800/1000]	i rolled my eyes , the heat rising and radiating from my face . " you 're trying to figure me out , are n't you ? " he ran a hand through his dark hair . i saw
[801/1000]	" i 'm not . i wo n't live it up , " she said with the same cool indifference she 'd raised her voice with in the garden and the train station . " my life will be over
[802/1000]	" this is the woman behind all of this ? " a man demanded . " you mean this was sarah the girl ? a thief from the swamp ? " " do n't be saying that . "
[803/1000]	" not tonight , " sean said carefully , " but tomorrow . " " i 've got time , " she said . she would be here , helping dylan and autumn get settled , watching her for
[804/1000]	' oh , that 's kind of you , ' she said . ' you probably saved my life . ' ' yes , ' said teppic , ' well , yes , i suppose , what 's that
[805/1000]	" he will , " she said . " thank you for your help . " i stood as she did . and then i leaned forward and kissed her . " you 're welcome , " i
[806/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i looked into his eyes . i saw the vulnerability , and i watched the fear start to evaporate . i bent down for a kiss . " in a minute
[807/1000]	" i 'm not a part of the family . not anymore , " i growled . he pulled his arm back , but not like he had planned , which worried me more , meaning he was n't going
[808/1000]	" how is your sister ? " he asked . " she 's good now . i want to keep her away from you if you stay away . " " why are you so upset about this
[809/1000]	" if you 'll look at this , " a young woman 's voice said . she was sitting on the edge of the aisle , tapping a cigarette against her palm . she wore headphones , and i recognized
[810/1000]	" i 've got a surprise for you , " liam said . i rolled one eye , but he just grinned . " what ? " i asked , moving my feet to get up . "
[811/1000]	i took a step back as i held out my hand . " can i help you ? " " i 'm sam rousseau , " the taller , younger man said , releasing his hold on the door
[812/1000]	" mr. president , please tell me ! " on the tv screen , president james d. roosevelt and a few american public officials were meeting in a private meeting of the white house . " tell me
[813/1000]	" well , it 's good to see you , my sweet princess . " " thank goodness , " i giggle . " i thought for sure you 'd abandoned your royal girlfriend , and it was embarrassing
[814/1000]	" i know that , but if i do n't keep her safe . and if i do , then it 's not as easy as it seems . " she did n't love him . in her heart
[815/1000]	" it 's okay . " he dropped the flashlight to the sofa and sat down beside her , then grabbed a handful of her hair . with shaking hands , he managed to wrestle the top of her sweatshirt
[816/1000]	i could do nothing , and my mother went on . " i suppose , " she said , " that it has to be both of them . so long as both of them say you loved them
[817/1000]	his voice turned to a growl . " if tonight is any indication , i plan on having many more days to watch . " " i think i 'm going to take an afternoon nap , " i
[818/1000]	" i think it 's great , " i say , but he 's already gone . " good . " he takes several steps towards me and reaches out , and i think he 's going to touch
[819/1000]	" it 's a lot to handle , " the doctor said . " i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate this . " " i appreciate everything , " julie said . " thanks , dr.
[820/1000]	my mouth gaped open at you . " what in " - i gulped in a breath of air - " hell . " " a little late to panic now , are n't we ? our lives are
[821/1000]	finally the two older men stood up . " what were we thinking " the one remarked to the other as he took the other elbow . " the way your father 's acting , i doubt he ever really
[822/1000]	slowly , i lift my gaze to his . his brows are drawn , and his lips are pressed together . he is deep in thought . his hair is a mess , and there is dried blood under his
[823/1000]	" we have his mother 's diary and his id pictures and everything about him , " beth said . " of course , " beth said . " i 'm sure we can find it . "
[824/1000]	we go from house to house as our lives come into direct sight , where john gives me a warm embrace and is happy in the presence of his wife . his arms embrace my shoulders and tickle the back
[825/1000]	" i do n't need me . " " but you do . " " you 're a bitch , and i hate you . why do you think i called and asked if you could come over
[826/1000]	" only when you 're on board with the rest of us . " " as i said , you will be with us long enough . and i 'd do the same , but for other reasons .
[827/1000]	i wanted his touch to be soft and loving . not hard and fast . not like the way he could grab me between his hands and haul me against him or strip me bare at the first opportunity .
[828/1000]	" are you kidding ! i 'm not going there ! i ca n't believe that her big sister brought her to a f * * king farm where nothing is allowed . here , let me show you .
[829/1000]	" well ? " she asked . " <EOS> now is not the time or place to bring those up . " " let 's go in and see if we can find anything . " they
[830/1000]	i was n't saying anything . i just wanted to give them a hard time . it was one thing to make them angry as my twin was . the other thing to make them want to hurt him was
[831/1000]	two hours later , richard stood on the street corner , watching the ambulance pull away from the curb . he knew it was gone before the police arrived , but he knew better than to call for help .
[832/1000]	" it 's a pleasure to meet you , grace . " it was n't until she was back in her car that they called again . grace called back with one more thing before hanging up the
[833/1000]	" i want to let it go as soon as possible . it 's too much and i need to focus on the real . i really want to tell scott , but i 'm scared he 'll say no
[834/1000]	she grinned and put her head in her hands . " now i 'm a bit upset . it makes me wonder how i get out of this mess without being pulled in other directions as well . "
[835/1000]	" oh , yes , mr. president . " the minister 's voice was tinged with pride . " the nation of the united states would be most appreciative . " the president took a breath , then leaned
[836/1000]	" yes , " she said , as if they 'd discussed this already . he sat down quietly at the kitchen table . he knew she worried over him , and she knew she 'd wanted to work
[837/1000]	and , he hoped , his heart . chapter nine the next morning , mary arrived at the home of mr. thornton the same as she had the day before , with a bundle of clothes , a
[838/1000]	the old man raised his head and glanced a bit blankly up to the balcony on which he stood , which led down to the back of the park and beyond . " here , " said the old
[839/1000]	his eyes narrowed . " can you blame him for taking me back to her house ? " " what 's so bad that you feel you have to wait and wait for the right woman to come ,
[840/1000]	" well ? " " yes . " " and ? " " i do n't know if i should show you the map . i wanted to talk to you first . " she tilted her
[841/1000]	" so ? " " have you worked with other women before ? " i 'd seen jack walk by a couple of times , but i 'd never said anything , had said something so embarrassing he
[842/1000]	" what are you saying , my lady ? " " my lord would like to speak with you privately . " the butler turned and went back into his study . she watched him go .
[843/1000]	" who , are you ? " chris said . " me , and we do n't have time to talk about this . take off ! " a flicker of fury , almost regret , crossed chris
[844/1000]	" how are you ? " " i 'm great . " i lie , looking down at the ground while i eat . " be careful , her father is very powerful . " raven jokes .
[845/1000]	" it 's a mistake , and i need to break it up quickly . " " what kinda mistake ? " " our marriage is over , paul . i 'm done with your life . "
[846/1000]	" you 're late , " her boss said coolly . " i 'm really sorry - " " it 's okay . i had everything under control . i 'd rather you did n't talk about it
[847/1000]	" all right . that was nice , " he admitted as he turned home . " i do n't know how to thank you . " " not a problem . " a statement to which i was
[848/1000]	she moved back to my side , a bit embarrassed and a bit irritated that the time to bring up the past had n't materialized as quickly as she had hoped . " i 'm sorry . my mind was
[849/1000]	" you do that , sister , a lot . it works for me . " " i knew that ! " she snapped . " i 'm so scared ... " she was right in front of
[850/1000]	the women took their places at the table and the service began . when they were done , someone standing at the front of the room asked if they wanted any more champagne . " champagne ? " sarah said
[851/1000]	" you know i do . i 've fought far harder than any of the other women i 've ever brought to your bed , " she told him darkly . " are you sure you want me to
[852/1000]	" uh , " i begin . was i interrupting something ? what ? " uh , i just wanted to say , i 'm sorry about all that . <EOS> f * * ked up and all .
[853/1000]	there was a moment where her muscles relaxed . the fire in the tub hissed , then came down to a crisp stream that burned her skin before she submerged herself in the water . she let the hot water
[854/1000]	david 's heart went out to him . ' you 're not one of them , william . ' ' i am now , ' said william , ' and i hate , do you understand now , a
[855/1000]	" no ! your life has n't been easy . " he said . " i was scared out of my mind when you came to my house that night to apologize to mark for the way things went
[856/1000]	" okay . i 'll do it . " " and then , he does this , " she paused for emphasis . " he can start a fire . " she added the last part to emphasize the
[857/1000]	" i saw you , " said the woman , and turned so her soft pink lips touched the girl 's ear . " you look . " the girl 's eyes were wide . that was all the
[858/1000]	" not really , " she said . " why not ? you 're not a model . ca n't you play someone ? " " sorry . but some are a little tough . like you .
[859/1000]	the answer the president of the united states knew in a direct confrontation was no . it was , of course , that the nation 's future , combined with its potential new leadership , lay in iraq and china
[860/1000]	i heard him take a deep breath . " well , i 've decided to send him to san diego with a shipment of a new pair of prosthetic wings , so you 'll be able to watch for him
[861/1000]	" i think i need more help , " i say . " who ? " " you know . " i pull a key out of my jeans pocket and flip it over . " i ca
[862/1000]	" did any of you have to find him ? " yeah , i did , " he answered without hesitation . there was no doubt that jack was talking to him . " that guy gave ty a
[863/1000]	where are you ? the woman was a little green - eyed and scared at the same time . it might be good if they figured out who she was . hope . she stood in the
[864/1000]	she did n't reply but the look she had on her face was determined and full of worry . " this way , " he said , taking her hand as he turned her towards the door .
[865/1000]	" we were all a little surprised but we do n't have to worry about a problem like that anymore . " i replied while turning to her . " and i understand your concern about the old lady and
[866/1000]	" thank you very much . " she spoke in a crisp , formal tone , which i took as her standard approach to interacting with me . " i will call you directly . " she lifted her
[867/1000]	" i 'm your friend . " " which i am . " " thanks . " i shrugged out of the jacket he 'd lent me and followed him . there was a chill in the air
[868/1000]	" oh , that 's right , " the man with the mustache corrected . " i was to tell you that the kid was the king of the irish . " " oh , great , " julian
[869/1000]	he had a family , maybe the most he knew , and no woman had ever made him feel like that . she was the first , the only . " you could have . " then he
[870/1000]	we 'd always run when things looked sour , and we 'd always run from each other . i did n't know how i missed the quiet , knowing ways other people died . it was so easy to forget
[871/1000]	" yes , of course ! it 's great you decided to come . thank you so much . " " it 's no problem . are you ok ? " " i have an appointment to see
[872/1000]	she thought she saw relief cross his face . " you 're not really happy about it , " he said very softly , still looking down the middle of her body . " of course , it is
[873/1000]	she waited . no longer was there an argument from anyone . she started to move . the pain began to ease . she did n't know what she was being told . being in a tent had nothing to
[874/1000]	" this place is going to rot my brain , " i said . i felt the effects of the drugs . the heat was stronger and the wind was stronger . " as soon as we 're back
[875/1000]	" stop , " she whispered . it was n't her she wanted him to stop . his eyes narrowed . his hand clenched around the top of her head . " i am touching you and i will
[876/1000]	her eyes suddenly shot open , as she began to take in the night air . the sky was beginning to lighten , reminding her that the sunrise was not far off . he turned to her , pulling the
[877/1000]	" i was just talking to you about how <EOS> ... you were that . " her hands went to her br * * sts . " i do n't know . " " i love you ! "
[878/1000]	" it 'd be a shame to miss this opportunity . " " so i 've been told . " the captain laughed heartily . " what shall we toast ? " john held out his glass and
[879/1000]	the one and only thing she could really think about a day earlier was how easy it had been to leave the family . she had been with jack since day one . from moment to moment .
[880/1000]	he looked down at me , and i opened my eyes . " okay . " chapter eight later that afternoon , jason was leaning against the counter in front of the tv when i walked in
[881/1000]	you knew you were in this mess when you went in there . " you did ? i have a feeling i do ? " he asked and laughed . they both had to stay on track .
[882/1000]	" he 's a smart man , " she murmured , looking a little bemused . " so i gather it was no loss for him to kill his son ? because it sure did seem like it to
[883/1000]	" what all is wrong with his head ? " demanded sarah . " do i look for problems ? " growled reynald . " he is simply exhausted and needs a bath ! " " i will
[884/1000]	they traveled in silence for half an hour , pulling along behind the two suvs . eventually they drew near the mountain , a beautiful stretch of solid red rock that housed the most amazing array of natural caves ,
[885/1000]	her lips twitched but she kept her mouth shut . she would n't share anything remotely personal with him . even the same thought was making her tense with nervous tension . and the fact that he was her mother
[886/1000]	" it 's not like it 's secret . " he nodded . " but you do n't want them to know ? " it sounded like he wanted to be alone . " no . just people
[887/1000]	" really , " says mom from my other side . mom and dad , her mom , and steve and i . " i was n't going to make you do this anyway , " i tell mom
[888/1000]	' what 's the point of this ? ' asked eben , walking closer to ag lar en . ' my lord , they have captured the king and are waiting in the city for the battle to begin
[889/1000]	" no , do n't , " he said , pulling her up close to his side . then he lowered his voice . " after i get the body straightened out in that restaurant i 'll tell you the
[890/1000]	i sighed . " in most cases , it 's an attempt to save the world - at least you and your family do to people . but from what i 've heard , it does have the opposite effect
[891/1000]	" you did a good job . " she gave me a little smile and leaned on the workbench , folding her legs underneath her . " it makes for a more pleasant life for yourself . " she sighed
[892/1000]	" oh , i did n't realise you 'd make an actual profit . that money is yours to spend on and you wo n't have to worry about cash payments , " she responded . " i hope you
[893/1000]	" it 's very late . " the words were low and strained . " when ? " i stared at him , shocked by his reaction . somehow , no matter how i had tried to control
[894/1000]	" she 's been back ever since she came back . she was with me for a few days looking after the whole family i lost and have n't heard a peep from her . " dad walks around
[895/1000]	when i got home , my dad was waiting for me . " what was all that noise ? " he asked . " just at the barn . i 'll only be a minute . " i
[896/1000]	" this ai n't like you . why the hell does he want your soul ? " " he - " " tell me the whole story , babe . " " he told me his story
[897/1000]	" no . " i pulled a corner of the duvet out from under me and lay down against it , so i was sitting up . " do you know what you said when i asked you to
[898/1000]	he had to find her now . he turned back to his task , wondering at the reason <EOS> to be <EOS> " working so late at night . " there was something about running , like there was

[900/1000]	everyone and their cats and everyone knew there was no way someone who worked for mr. ar can a on that first day of his job would actually have any sympathy for him , not unless she had n't had
[901/1000]	his words froze her at the sudden realization that she . this was a relationship <EOS> , and with him , she knew that at that moment she could n't deny his words , could n't stop them now that
[902/1000]	he said no more , his eyes holding a fire like no other . i did n't like that look in them . the fire was too warm and i imagined as i passed up the back of his jacket
[903/1000]	" no way . " eve shook her head . " can we ? " " we always have to , " alec assured . " trust me . since the decision to come here was un win n
[904/1000]	" yes . was he really jealous ? " she pulled back from him for a moment , then rested her elbows on the counter . he could n't have agreed more . she looked over at
[905/1000]	she took my hand and led me over to one of the few other people who could hear each person through what looked like a wall of phone tape . what she had no idea , at the moment ,
[906/1000]	he looks at my hand as if it 's a piece of meat . " do n't pull my leg . " " what if i need to ? " it was the truth . i wanted to
[907/1000]	" you 'd better hurry , " he said , with an impish wink that only added to the delicious blush that was suddenly threatening his cheeks . " there 's been an accident . " as if on
[908/1000]	" ah yes they say in the news tonight , the hero has arrived . " " are n't they all in this for him now ? does , i mean is the world safe ? " "
[909/1000]	she wanted someone <EOS> i could control and whom i could live with , was waiting in heaven or hell . no . i wanted to be safe . and i could give it all . let me watch you
[910/1000]	" how long has he been here ? " she asked . " since the attack hit . but it could be hours . " " what about his parents ? " " both died in the
[911/1000]	" what ? " i asked , the heat seeping in between my fingers . " you heard me . " " she was supposed to be a soldier . she was supposed to be dead . "
[912/1000]	" i was at a seminar coming up and i met a tall , gray haired man who introduced himself to me , " she replied , then she pointed into the living room and said over her shoulder ,
[913/1000]	and i could feel him , hard , hard as steel , and the breath in my throat deepened until it came out in a whisper . i slid down , and he groaned as my body tightened around
[914/1000]	" you 're my wife , gavin . " she was talking shit ? he rubbed his temple . " you are one hell of a woman and i appreciate that . i want you to be my
[915/1000]	" it is not a lot , it 's about four times what i actually put in the bowl , " she told him , " it is a good pot of tea . " " it still needs
[916/1000]	' yeah , you did , that 's actually why i found it . that 's why i 've been trying to find it . i wanted to find you again . ' ' tell me everything you can
[917/1000]	she gave a small shake of her head . " he 's gone , " she said miserably . something did n't feel right about that . " you do n't mean to say that he 's ...
[918/1000]	' i 'm not - ' ' no ... of course you are n't . now , would you like to stay out of it ? ' ' oh . ' one second he turned away ,
[919/1000]	" not this time , " i said , and pointed toward the far corner of the cavern . " see that tunnel over there ? " i flicked my fingers , then pointed at the one at the same
[920/1000]	a lot of <EOS> was , too , and no matter how old school . he decided not to try with the hot dogs , but that would work . the food would be plenty , if you had to
[921/1000]	" that 's where you 're wrong , kid . i 'm like the brother you never had and never would - the one who always managed the time by taking care of the family instead of relying on the
[922/1000]	the air shimmered with a warning , and it was far too close . a figure with the same black turban as the man with the red bandana stepped out from in front of the house with a massive cleaver
[923/1000]	it was a perfect moment , of joy with her naked , open and ready for him as he held his weight above her . he could forget the rest of the world and only concentrate on this one woman
[924/1000]	" you 'd think they should have let me handle things by now , but i 'm fine . i used to live near here . i can see all the tracks from the way back . and i know
[925/1000]	not only do i believe that in my book , but i am a writer himself . the word does not make me any less of a writer . this book is based solely on the premise and therefore contains
[926/1000]	" oh , i do . there she is . " you remember ? of course ! i 've remembered what happened . that 's why i came to you . " " and who exactly are you
[927/1000]	" you sure ? " i whispered . his head dipped closer and he replied " i 've got a lot f * * kin ' shit to do that 's not in a grocery store but a grocery
[928/1000]	" good . now , if i may see your face please , please forgive me for interrupting , " i say , smiling . her cheeks turn blue , but she tries to smile . " you are
[929/1000]	he watched as i came . i was a very lucky girl . he liked women that well . " i 'll think about it , " he said , putting the pen on the table . he
[930/1000]	" they need blood for their training , " she said . i stared at her , then suddenly laughed out loud . " yes , they do . they 're working with us . " " how
[931/1000]	" yes . " the woman shrugged . " it 's what you want , so i 'll do my best . but how much did she pay you for this place ? " " ten million for
[932/1000]	" the way i see it you get the same privileges in my world as i do in yours . " " really ? " " really . the fact is , you take a shower and go
[933/1000]	i felt like my stomach was too full for a walk in the rain , so as i tried to leave i thought of the three of us sitting outside talking about our future together in the parking lot .
[934/1000]	" oh no you do not . i am not leaving you now ! it looks like i 'll have to do a little dancing for you , because you 'll do a hell of a lot more dancing if
[935/1000]	" not necessarily . " it feels so good to be the one to be the one ... to get him to beg me for his ... he pushes slightly . " you wanna come ? " "
[936/1000]	i got up . " i have to go , " i said . " you have to know this . you said you did n't have time for a party . you said you 'd go . "
[937/1000]	" yeah , but you said they were all working like crazy because you did n't have a driver 's license . had to go from your mom 's house in palm springs to a bunch coming downtown , and
[938/1000]	" only ten grand ! " her father echoed sarcastically . " no , it was part of our cover charge ! " natalie said , shocked . her mother turned , wide - eyed . " what
[939/1000]	he kissed her . he loved her . he needed her . why did it have to be some f * * ked - up logic ? she could n't understand the reasoning why and it did n't make any
[940/1000]	" i 'd like , " she said . " all right . then i 'll find you a drink . " i reached for the door handle . " are you sure about this ? i mean ,
[941/1000]	and then suddenly one of the girls suddenly slammed her head into a soldier 's face and rolled onto the ground . a second girl turned , raising a dagger like a sword before attacking . the soldier grabbed
[942/1000]	" thanks , but i 'm good . " " well , i 've got plans later , " he said . " we have to ... get to work . remember ? " i nodded , but
[943/1000]	" this is n't what i meant . " " this is n't you . " " if it 's not my heart , then who is it ? " " my baby ? you 're pregnant
[944/1000]	" as for where we must go ... " " you have been doing something illegal , surely ? " " yes . " " have you been working with the law ? " they were
[945/1000]	no man 's voice came through the intercom . ' oh come on , ' said the little voice across the room . ' you look like you 're about to throw up . ' ' oh come
[946/1000]	" ok . thank you , " i said , standing and dusting off my jeans . " what do you think about all that ? " " i think it 's way too much . i 'll still
[947/1000]	" sorry . " " i just - " i glanced up and met her gaze . " what was up with shane ? you 've been going a little crazy lately . " " he needed to
[948/1000]	" i do n't think she is . " " that is odd . " " <EOS> or if he was out to lunch . " " unless she was going to eat out of his mind
[949/1000]	it 's not that i was n't prepared . i had meant to be ready , sure , but i was so nervous - and i was n't . i felt as if someone had stepped into my womb and
[950/1000]	he waited on the curb , glancing around to make sure they were alone , then pulled out another envelope . " open that one first . " when she read the card , his eyebrows came together .
[951/1000]	" that 's good as a good plan , " emily said . then they waited in silence , the only sound the buzz of the helicopter overhead . the radio crackled as it continued to signal for incoming
[952/1000]	now , i have to kill you , but they do n't know that . how 'bout i write you up and tell you to drop by whenever the hell you want ? " ' " i guess it
[953/1000]	" will you be able to keep the story to yourself ? " he asked with a slight shake of her head . " i will , " she promised . " i will do my best to not
[954/1000]	" there 's no way we can call the police and have them come over here , " i said . " i told them what we saw . " " no , " nathan said . " the
[955/1000]	i raised my eyebrow at him . " i do n't understand why you wo n't - " the door opened before he was able to finish his reply . one large , well - built man emerged ,
[956/1000]	" the only thing i can remember is that it was like having my heart ripped out as i watched them run a drill the rest of their lives . " he looked at me and started laughing .
[957/1000]	" that was before the big earthquake , " julia began . " we 've been living off of the land for almost a year now . like , everybody , we had small houses on several acres out in
[958/1000]	why not ? she would get <EOS> run the floor . not her . never mind this . stop ! she did n't think about it . as well as her secret with one of the werewolves in
[959/1000]	" i 'm not a big fan of drinking from the tap . " he tipped her chin up with his fingertip and waited . " but i 'll make an exception if you tell me how you 're feeling
[960/1000]	i swallowed once and asked , " i have n't had sex except with guys before you ? " " that 's because i 'm not the kind of guy who gets off on the idea of having sex
[961/1000]	" i love you , sweetheart ? " he 'd whispered . her eyes had sw um open and the first thing she 'd said to him . " everything , " she 'd said . and he
[962/1000]	not quite . she leaned into the passenger window . " i 'm not looking for a big sister , " she began , " because of you . you were all i had . " he
[963/1000]	" well , you know , i was planning an intervention and thought maybe a little more family would be nice . " i said . " what did you have in mind ? " she questioned .
[964/1000]	" why would n't i ? that 's what you 've been telling me myself . it 's not a very happy position for anyone , but you 've set it up just like you set it up for others
[965/1000]	" i 'm fine . can i go after them ? " " yeah , but just make sure you call the cops first . " he glanced at his watch . " you 're a junior , too
[966/1000]	" wait a minute , " i said , grabbing his arm . " you ca n't just run away like that . hell , if you do n't want to tell anyone , they do n't have to know
[967/1000]	just when i thought the nightmare was over , mr. ka min ski said , " well , there you are again . i was just congratulating myself , but it was n't enough . " he gave a crooked
[968/1000]	" i did it well . not even a scratch , " i said dryly . my phone buzzed in my bra , signaling i had an incoming text . " thanks . i was n't trying to sound conceited
[969/1000]	ethan lifted his head , his eyes locking on the first one he saw . then he went racing down the hall , headed for ethan 's room . sarah rushed down the hall to the room where she 'd
[970/1000]	" wait . i 'm on duty , ma'am . i ca n't let anyone back in here . i 'm also the only one in here . " i started to ask him if he was going in
[971/1000]	i looked inside and saw i was there not only on a horse but in the air with it . the horse looked like a bird that looks like a bird but has huge teeth . i looked around
[972/1000]	" that 's nice , " i said . " that should impress your uncle and niece . it would , if they had n't been so busy trying all these other things that they were n't too excited to
[973/1000]	he stepped closer . " want to tell me what 's going on inside that head of yours ? " she bit her bottom lip in thought . how could she explain to him why he was making her
[974/1000]	" what ? that he 's not fine ? " i asked uneasily . " he 's just worried about the party . did you try to talk him out of it ? " " no , because
[975/1000]	she raised her brows in surprise , but simply placed it neatly inside the first aid kit . " i was afraid you 'd never ask , " she said quietly . she took the first aid kit from her
[976/1000]	it made no sense of what had just happened . it was as if something had hit my head and then i fell out of my body from the inside . i gasped , not on pain , but because
[977/1000]	" yes , the first time i was brought there ; you told me that you loved it there . of course there is no reason for you not to live there ... i just had n't told you what
[978/1000]	" a name , and a location . " " yes . but it will not be in english , will it ? " i thought a bit about it for a moment , and then shrugged my
[979/1000]	' why 'd he say he was a secret police officer ? ' patroclus asked as he began to dig his tiny rocks out of the soft sand . ' it was true then ? ' ' it sounded
[980/1000]	the line in front of the glass shook , and the person to the right started typing . she pulled the phone away from her ear and whispered several times , the sound of sound reverberating through the space between
[981/1000]	which is why she must come right to the point - she can not allow the matter of miss ber liner to come to a head - so that all the gossip does not become public knowledge to the court
[982/1000]	" a little bit . " " so you 'd rather go to jail for kidnapping and killing my sister than to me ? " my head jerked back , and my jaw opened . maybe i was
[983/1000]	there they were . he could hear the voices in the street and the people moving about them , so there must have been people coming and going . still , despite the heat and the exhaustion , he felt
[984/1000]	" yeah , " she said without looking up , " i get it . " when she looked up at her , she gave a little smirk and seemed to understand the gravity of the situation . "
[985/1000]	" this is my mother . i called while getting the kids ready . " he looked at her slightly nervous yet amused expression . " how is your mother doing today ? " tabitha laughed . "
[986/1000]	" i suppose i can see why , " replied the chief as he slowly lowered the hammer and lowered the lever . " the power supply is still stable , sir . " " are you sure
[987/1000]	but still ... he 's one of the strongest men i know . he 'll stand up for me , even if he does n't quite know what it means . and unlike the two of them , he
[988/1000]	" the law , " i whispered to al . " why would that matter to me ? " he sniffed . " it - it 's stupid . and i ca n't believe you 'd take advantage
[989/1000]	<EOS> then a little faster . over . over . too fast . the silence was n't uncomfortable , but it was n't just her , either . just the roar of her heart - it mattered
[990/1000]	" sure , " i said , sitting on the edge of the bed . " oh , you got ta buy me some condoms . " i looked down at my now - empty chest . i
[991/1000]	i was also on the balcony , sitting at the long table in the center of the room , staring out at the busy dance floor under the pale golden chandeliers . it was almost two o'clock already . two
[992/1000]	" what ? " he asked . he 'd heard this from countless men , his brothers , not to mention - " you 're a virgin ! " one of the males spat . " is she yours
[993/1000]	" fine , miss , and thank you . for everything . he 's been a life saver with me . " she hugged my stomach . " no offense . " i smiled . " none taken .
[994/1000]	" they ca n't help it , you know . they 're like animals that have to be fixed . " she reached for the chair next to her . " for what reason does that matter to him
[995/1000]	" i ... don't know , i just knew all this time that one day i would stop talking to everyone and they would be gone . that i would n't be able to hurt anyone . i came back
[996/1000]	" why did n't you say something ? " he asked , sounding genuinely upset and confused . her eyes widened at the insult . " why did n't i say anything ? i 'm not that stupid !
[997/1000]	for all these years , i was on the run . i 'd lost dad , and here i was hiding behind this family before it even started . i was just a little girl , barely able to cope
[998/1000]	" tell me something , " i said , my voice rising a notch . " why are all those people so scared of the house ? did you have any idea ? " he sighed again and shifted
[999/1000]	" as long as we 're on the same page and i 'm honest and truthful , i 'll listen . " she put her hands on her hips , crossing her arms . " i 'm not sure
