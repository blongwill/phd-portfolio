[154/1000]	" what does that mean ? " asked the man . " you 're a celebrity , are n't you ? " he laughed again . " no , but i think i 'm more famous than you .
[155/1000]	" i 'm good , " i say just as he starts to lean over to kiss me . without giving him a chance to protest , i kiss him back . this is n't the first time we 've
[156/1000]	" okay , i 'll try the first of four , " i answered . " and the third ? " i looked up at him , and again he looked like he was holding back something important
[157/1000]	" was n't this yesterday 's paper ? " she asked , trying to act casual , but her heart was starting to speed up . she was so excited to see evan that she almost jumped up and down

[159/1000]	" this is going to be fun . " " it 's fun in theory but it 's very dangerous . " " i 'll bet . " i reached the driveway . the four meter cab
[160/1000]	" yes . i 'm keeping it . you got it ? " " oh , i think it 'll match , " she smiled and walked back into her home , holding his notebook in her hand .
[161/1000]	" i saw a woman there that day , " he said . " she looked younger , shorter and younger than the doctor . perhaps twenty - five or thirty . " " so she died in the
[162/1000]	" when can you get here ? " " soon . " " and when can you get here ? " " why ? oh , come on , mike . you know i ca n't go
[163/1000]	mike shook his head . " tell him to go away , but now . " jake lowered his head . " i ca n't do that . i 've been asking for a year . we 're old
[164/1000]	" and why did she choose you ? " " well . " he seemed to think about it for a while . it had to be a stupid question . " i guess it just did n't feel
[165/1000]	" how 's my boy ? " " he 's good jim . " jim went back to sipping his beer . " and how 's his son ? " " pretty good too . "
[166/1000]	" <EOS> first time i went out for pizza . the other day , i tried ice cream , and soon after that it was a time bomb . " thanks to josh to join us ?
[167/1000]	" and did n't you - i mean ... how did we get here ? " he stepped back . " your ex - boyfriend . " " you did n't call max , you said his name
[168/1000]	" thank you , " the captain said . he patted me on the back , stood , and said , " i 'll have the lads in the shop down the hall , " before disappearing like a well
[169/1000]	" this is important , " i said pointedly , trying to get past him . my eyes met seth 's and i shook my head . " go get another drink . " " i ca n't ...
[170/1000]	" i do n't need any more pain right now . the last thing i need are you in a coma , which at this moment would be terrible , but you 'll need your rest for certain , so
[171/1000]	" you 'd better call the other guys and let them know that the problem is gone . we 'll discuss it later , " she told him , which was true . she did n't want to alarm him
[172/1000]	" and this is you giving me grief over my boyfriend ? " they 've never been that close . she pushes me back off the bed and drops the condom on the floor beside her . "
[173/1000]	the first thing he had done when he got to the house was check the glove compartment , his favorite trick for getting that sort of attention . he found it . the last part showed no sign of damage
[174/1000]	i felt dizzy and faint , and when i found that a table was nearby , i could n't remember ever getting up . then someone was helping me up , and i was sitting in a chair while someone
[175/1000]	' god will heal , ' said gandalf , ' if it remains mine alone . ' the wizard lay down , before the fire , and closed his eyes . as he did so , he spoke :
[176/1000]	" you 'll love england . " she bit her lip and shrugged . " most people do . the place is n't much to look at , but i 'm glad i came . it 's beautiful .
[177/1000]	" okay , " she replied , glancing over her shoulder . " but this is n't about ' getting in . ' " he stepped closer , forcing her to do the same . he wrapped his arms
[178/1000]	" one day i thought , " he began . " i was still afraid of leaving you , and i stopped listening to my brothers . but it was too late by then . " he shrugged . "
[179/1000]	but just not the way cole and his brothers always told her to . " so , how 's it going , cole ? " her father asked , joining her in the kitchen . " fine .
[180/1000]	her mom took a drink of her beer . " i think you 're about to find out . " chapter 7 friday night " hey ! " cheyenne called to her friend cheyenne standing between the
[181/1000]	" mr. adams ! " " and if i was you ? " the man called over in a high - pitched voice that made me flinch , and suddenly i 'd have to defend myself . all
[182/1000]	i feel a strong hand squeeze my left shoulder . it 's the captain of the ship 's crew , john , who has got me by the elbow . i go with him for a few seconds , turning
[183/1000]	" and we 'll never bother them again , " claire assured her . " we 'll be back for your next full year , mrs. buchanan , and we 'll ... " emily gave a short laugh .
[184/1000]	" yes , it 's a lovely one , " she replied . " is that it ? it 's lovely . " " it has a lot of people in it , " he said . " your
[185/1000]	all night he 'd dreamed of her , of his beautiful bride <EOS> tonight , and dreamed of how she 'd look tonight - and she 'd kissed him like none other had . so much for this " gift
[186/1000]	" if there is a difference between an assassin and something as harmless as a ball of fluff , i 'm an un imaginative one . " he offered her the other side of the bed , his hand brushing
[187/1000]	" she keeps telling me how much she wanted a baby , how jealous she suddenly was . you were both so young and handsome , so much fun to play with . i wish i could have been there
[188/1000]	and just like that , all the bad - boy ways that he had spoken to her only a few nights ago were back and <EOS> and even as he had taken her back in the basement of his bedroom
[189/1000]	" in my world , we do not kill our own people . " i had spoken as if i believed this , and then began coughing violently . i almost blacked out from the pain . i was n't
[190/1000]	even in the fading light , i could see the black dot . <EOS> , a few minutes ago when i could n't remember where i 'd only looked , and i got an overpowering sense of the breeze under
[191/1000]	" okay , you can come out this afternoon , after you 've had time to get warmed up and eat . but be warned , it 's going to be a long day for you . " "
[192/1000]	" that 's because i 'm not here yet , " he said , standing up . " and i 'm doing fine . i know where your friend lives , so i 'm not sure how you could help
[193/1000]	they headed upstairs , not really sure where they were going . michael helped eve and eve look around , and said , " the bathroom looks okay , " which michael was about to point out was n't what
[194/1000]	a strong gust of wind swept through the trees , flattening them . clouds began to settle in the sky . it would be cool again it would be pouring again they spent a pleasant evening as they carried
[195/1000]	" yes . that 's a good idea . thank you . " he nodded , and the guy moved next to me . the guy put his arm around me . " so , are we on
[196/1000]	she seemed almost startled until she glanced up at him and blinked . " you 're still with the gang ? " " yes . " she pulled back a little and her eyes became too bright for
[197/1000]	" where is he , " i whisper <EOS> ... i do like it . finally , so soft ... so peaceful . my mouth feels full . the night is still . i sigh into my pillow .
[198/1000]	" i know , " she said . " he must be someone if you could n't be alone with him forever . " then there was silence for a few moments . " i told you he was
[199/1000]	she did n't mind being questioned by the person who was in charge of her case . " what about the other suspects ? " " how can you remember all of their names ? " who
[200/1000]	" they say this was a great event on the side of the east , like , 30 to 40 percent of other deaths , " said zachary . " and that was n't all just men and women
[201/1000]	" i was saying ... " " good . i will not join your conversation . " " come , my boy , this will give you a good chance . " " i will get another
[202/1000]	" so are i , " i replied . my skin was damp , my blood warm . the night air swirled around us , clinging to my long black hair . " so ... i kind of thought
[203/1000]	" it 's all right , " he answered . " it 's for the best . i 'll be okay . " with that he turned his attention back to mark , who looked even more surprised at
[204/1000]	" your uncle 's got a bad case of the flu that i do n't know what to do with . i have n't had this problem before and it scares the crap out of me . " "
[205/1000]	" yes , " he said thickly . " but you wo n't be needing these . " " you think so ? " i asked , laughing . i wanted him to touch me , to have me
[206/1000]	she turned from him and looked across the pond to the far horizon . " no , honey , i saw you . " turning back to him , she cocked her head . " i 'm glad you did
[207/1000]	" tell me , is that the last time you could remember walking into the house ? " she had her back to him as she sorted through the stacks of mail , envelopes and the envelopes that had been
[208/1000]	' i would think you would feel safer , ' she said . ' i do n't ever feel safe . ' he looked at the woman he loved once more . laura stood beside him . '
[209/1000]	the room was large and sparsely furnished , and she imagined there was a bedroom at the back of the room and she imagined the bed in there , a luxurious , luxurious bed . as for the man beside
[210/1000]	" i 'm never going to get out of this , " he laughed . " i thought someone else was going to . " the next morning he was ready ; the moment his fingers reached across
[211/1000]	" can we go inside ? " she sighed . " i suppose . " they stepped inside and settled themselves in the living room . olivia made a mental note to ask olivia if they could borrow
[212/1000]	he had one of those thick curls he liked to give her , the length long and falling over his shoulder . " i believe i did . but you need to read whatever does n't make sense for someone
[213/1000]	why would he ? she knew he hated what she 'd done to ian , but she would never see the beast that had taken so much satisfaction from her little man . and he had known ... he 'd
[214/1000]	" sorry , ms. black . i could n't resist . " she turns left now . " well , go on and see how things are going . those chairs will be fine . " it 's the same
[215/1000]	i 've given it a lot of thought this year . i think it 's time i start up a charitable foundation , and i plan to publish quite a bit of what he called the ' charity ' i
[216/1000]	" it wo n't be as bad as for the kids , though . they 've all been working for the hospital for a while now . she would n't be happy about it , but they all seem to
[217/1000]	we 're just talking about that afternoon 's dinner . i did n't ask him specifically , but it has an effect on me . i think about what he said before i came back and he 'll definitely need
[218/1000]	" yeah . " he laughed . " just know that if we do n't get down to business soon , or at all , there wo n't be anything left for you to have any use for . "
[219/1000]	" oh ... ha ha ... " i hear her laughter echoing , barely audible . i pull the shirt back down over my head . she 's laughing at me . i watch her through foggy eyes .
[220/1000]	he lifted his head and looked on the other side of the bed . " where 's bella ? " that was better . bella had been up long before the alarm went off . it
[221/1000]	the girl looked at her expectantly . " why yes , i am . i am here for the job . i am supposed to have a letter from a very powerful woman called the empress , and i
[222/1000]	" did she say it without thinking ? " " maybe . " " do you want me to have her call you after she makes the call ? or should i wait until you take her to
[223/1000]	" yes , she is . " " i wanted to ask her a favour . " " i 'm listening . " " i 'm sorry if it was ugly before , but she has something
[224/1000]	" you found my son ! " " it 's all right , father , " daemon whispered to him . for the first time since his birth , daemon was able to rest his bruised and battered limbs
[225/1000]	" yes . just call tonight . " " okay . bye . " i hang up and make my way up to my room where my phone is already buzzing with more calls . no other calls so
[226/1000]	" let 's forget about business , " i said . " let 's focus on me . it does n't matter if you know i 'm an insane bitch or not ; i know about you , and i
[227/1000]	he turned his head to peer at me , and smiled . " let me find something to throw at you . " i winced at his tone even though his eyes were sparkling , and his arms
[228/1000]	" so ! " the president of the united states was a heavyset man in his forties with sandy - blond hair and a bald spot on the top of his bald head . he grinned at me .
[229/1000]	she did n't even hear them coming up the stairwell . thirty he was in a taxi , the tinted windows of the mit su bi shi closing in on him with each step . he could smell
[230/1000]	" have a good evening , mrs. bel kin . " " good evening , jake . " she watched him as he walked away before closing the door . she sighed and looked up at the ceiling ,
[231/1000]	he studied me a moment , his eyes searching mine . then he shook his head . " i apologize , " he said a little gruffly . " do n't apologize for me . i had a really
[232/1000]	" okay , okay . that 's enough ! " i waved at them with my hands and then i felt a giant hand come down on my neck . it was michael , of course . " there you
[233/1000]	" we 've <EOS> were out of the local shops , all the shopping , and the party last night last night ... " we 're up now . back to our places . i ca n't imagine why we
[234/1000]	as the day progressed , the worst of his worst mala dy got worse <EOS> ... he was unable to stay a secret even a hole with his grief , like playing out to his old frustration , <EOS> back
[235/1000]	" let 's try , " said adam . he put adam 's mobile on the counter , pulled out a pencil - thin blue folder and opened it up . adam made a few notes - " they
[236/1000]	they rode all night , until they had to stop for the day . the sun was high , so they waited on shore . the road meandered along the shore , growing increasingly steeper with every passing mile .
[237/1000]	she glanced back at him , grinning . " are you seriously asking me that ? " " yeah , but i 'm pretty sure it 's true . " laughing , she crossed to the nearest closet
[238/1000]	the thing <EOS> with no memory at all about it . it took them through most of the morning in darkness , when finally they came to the day of the meeting , the day with the dream . all
[239/1000]	" you 're safe , you know , " i say . she shudders slightly . " now , that makes me feel even better . i 'm afraid this is what i do n't manage too well .
[240/1000]	' can you tell me where i can access the first and last link on this ' , said charles . ' i have a list of all people who might have a connection , it might help to
[241/1000]	" my last entry has changed . for one of our girls , one a little younger than you , sex is not the only thing that 's made your life a lot easier . our girlfriends have offered
[242/1000]	the police officer looked like he had just slept , but it was unlikely that they would be forced to arrest him even if they did . they had their reason and he was part of it . not even
[243/1000]	" we should sit around and chill , " she said . " take a break . maybe you can start with that tea before i get up . " " oh , right . tea . "
[244/1000]	" thank god , " said the captain . " if you knew where the damned thing was , i 'm afraid there 'd be hell to pay . " " we 're not to be disappointed . "
[245/1000]	" it 's not real . " " what ? ! " " i guess it is . " " you mean the water here is real ? " " uh - huh . but anyway
[246/1000]	" i told you , this is how it works , and i 'm not letting a woman in until my hand is clean . remember ? " " ok , but ... " " and for the
[247/1000]	" i have to leave , but he wo n't appreciate my presence here . " he moved past her , reached the bedroom . she was still asleep when the door opened . she was n't there ,
[248/1000]	i nod slowly . " are you still angry ? " he shakes his head . " i 'm happy . " and then he goes silent again . it 's as if he 's afraid he might
[249/1000]	the way she said it , the way she kept looking at him ; that one syllable . like one word . a single word . something he did n't know . " fine , why not ? "
[250/1000]	" you have my permission , " sebastian said . " and no , we 're not close friends . but he will never be able to hurt you again . " " all the while , he wants
[251/1000]	it 's such a contradiction that it 's the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard . " how could you do something like that for me ? that 's so - " " you 're making a
[252/1000]	both had their own house . except ... even so , she was very pleased with him . especially after he 'd broken the mating , but he did n't force her . had he felt the strain
[253/1000]	and she knew it . because , as she 'd suspected when he 'd shown up a few minutes ago , she was the only one doing exactly what he wanted . sliding her hand between their bodies ,
[254/1000]	" he was a student at the university , now he teaches . " ruth nodded as if this explanation made sense . " what made him graduate ? " francesca wanted to know . " she 's
[255/1000]	" <EOS> " - she was pretty sure he was there for obvious reasons . after all , she had already told her mom about this week 's adventure and all , so they could easily stay in touch
[256/1000]	' look , when a couple find each other , the kind of thing happens . ' ' yes , i remember . ' ' well , then , apart from just having had the hots for him
[257/1000]	no , he had other ideas . it was n't like he had n't thought before . even his favorite movie had been at that movie . but , as ever , after so considerable practice at the
[258/1000]	" oh , " she said again as if from a great distance . " oh , yes . " " yeah . " his eyes narrowed even further . she blushed again . " oh .
[259/1000]	" you could try and make sense of it , " she said . " i ca n't argue with that logic . " at least she 'd gotten that much from me . as for the rest
[260/1000]	he smiled and squeezed her . " i feel the same way . " after turning in , she turned her head . he caught her expression and his lips curved in a gentle grin . " see
[261/1000]	he had to get out from behind the wheel . he had to get away . damn , she still was n't answering his calls . but he had to find a way to get her to answer if
[262/1000]	it was n't much trouble having a gun at the house . but <EOS> actually - my usual the way i loved it was easy to do , and then i 'd picked up the cat , but that
[263/1000]	his eyes fluttered open . " <EOS> ... " his eyes drifted to me 's face . " sorry . yeah . it 's all good but mostly not , even when you were in the army . "
[264/1000]	the woman looked in all directions as she ran away , only to look up and see the two men rushing after her . " get in your car ! " one of them bellowed and he jumped into his
[265/1000]	" it 's all right , " he said , holding up his hand to ward her off . " i get it . i 'm trying to be an angel here . i 'm really not a part of
[266/1000]	" if he ever finds out what happened out there - you really should n't repeat anything he says to you ! " " i 'm not in his life , " he says . just then we
[267/1000]	she glanced away from him and mumbled , " when he made a lot of promises to me , he meant them . " " as do i. " and she was a liar . really , really
[268/1000]	" would you please do it , please hurry , please hurry ! did you shoot her ? did you throw . did you ? are you here to kill me ? the girls are missing ! have you killed
[269/1000]	he dropped into the armchair . " i 'm the guy she 's going to stay with until i win . " " you are a rotten son of a bitch . " she pressed down on the accelerator
[270/1000]	" there 's nothing to worry over . " to my surprise , i hear a smile in cole 's voice . what 's he doing ? why does he smile at me like that ? " i 'm
[271/1000]	the lights came on , and they could see that they had been right . " why did n't you tell me i was running for the cover of night ? " she snapped at him . the
[272/1000]	he would n't allow her to spend more than a few hours on any of the events that had brought her to her knees . " no . " he pushed away from the banister . " i do
[273/1000]	" well , maybe later , " said charlie . " my mum will be here soon and it will be nice to be rid of them . " " you know it will . " charlie looked
[274/1000]	i 've got to get her to trust me that there 's the strength in us to fight this . if we do , then it 's inevitable that it 's over . and even as i think these
[275/1000]	" come toward us , " said dormer , his voice thick with exhaustion . he moved toward the small entrance to the room . the girl stood , head cocked as she listened . she raised her face
[276/1000]	" no , " lily said on a low , steady exhale . " it just happened . i do n't think i 've ever known such pleasure . i 've never had such heat . i 've never come
[277/1000]	he must have had a different idea . ' you mean , some girl ? ' he said , though i did n't doubt that he meant the girl who wore a dress and ran up and down the
[278/1000]	so i just let him make those moves on me . the ones that are n't forbidden or unwelcome or dirty . the ones that show blatant intimacy . the ones that make me feel safe and secure .
[279/1000]	" this is my father , " gabriel said solemnly , keeping his gaze fixed on gabriel . " who 's been sending you money and jewelry ever since you got back . you have to understand that i 've
[280/1000]	" my phone was broken . the battery 's dead . my purse 's empty . " she looked at the book on the counter and pointed at the last sentence , the two lines she saw in the photograph
[281/1000]	" i would . " she sighed . " but i really am afraid i 'm going to mess things up more when i get home . " " do n't be nervous , do n't fret . we
[282/1000]	" what about our agreement with them ? we ca n't let this go on indefinitely . we have to talk to them . " " yes , " he said with a nod . " i can see
[283/1000]	" what is this all about , then ? " i turn to face him . " stop being so suspicious and start trusting me , " he says , holding up both my hands and kissing them in
[284/1000]	" you want her to be happy ? " " maybe they let her out the back . maybe she does n't want to come back . maybe there 's nothing left for me to do but say a

[286/1000]	i gave the three little girls a look . one was crying and snot streamed down her face . just from witnessing such a public display of emotion , i was a little pissed . this girls little world was

[288/1000]	" not a thing . i told you i 'm just leaving to get my bike . " he pushed himself up . " do n't you think you should get your bike ? " " what kind
[289/1000]	" who was that ... " i blinked . " dead , " he answered carefully . it was shocking . great . he was dead . i swallowed and my heartbeat kicked up a
[290/1000]	at the sound of my voice , she turned her head and opened her eyes when she saw me . " oh , hey . are your mom and dad staying in ? " " yeah . "
[291/1000]	" no , too late for that , " she said . " i had to start it . " he looked at her coldly . " it 's the middle of the night , darling . what are
[292/1000]	" go ahead . tell me . " she had a habit of going off on him when she was excited . but when she needed to talk , gavin was usually there for her , and he could
[293/1000]	he raised his hand and the man fell behind , his crossbow still trained on alex . alex smiled at him and the man 's hand slowly raised , ready to fire . he pulled the strings up to get
[294/1000]	" so that 's how you got me out in the parking lot ? with you trying to kill my puppy and all that ? " he did n't move , and she saw no hint of anger in
[295/1000]	" i take it that the next question will be the same one . " " i was wrong , which means there are things you should let me explain . " " there are some things you
[296/1000]	" i 'm okay , " i laughed . he kissed me again and pulled out of my arms . i heard him leaving the room and i lay there confused . a tear dripped down my cheek and
[297/1000]	" but he 's my son ! i ca n't just go to the police ! it 's against the law ! " she swallowed her frustration and held up her hands defensively . " whoa , slow down
[298/1000]	i 've always dreamt of this day when i die . i 've been on a bus for hours , just sitting in a tiny tent while a man in a pink bathing suit told me how much he would
[299/1000]	" you 've done a lot for that group , " i said . " you should n't have let them do it - " " i 'm getting the hang of it , " he said .
[300/1000]	" yeah . i figured since you got fired , you could use the company . can you sit down ? " jake 's gaze lowered , as though searching for what his friend was n't hiding .
[301/1000]	" i wo n't make any decisions if you do n't . i just - " i leaned forward . " i 'll make reservations tonight , or i want to meet with the rest of the board a
[302/1000]	jack looked around - everyone 's attention had turned to him . he spoke quickly . " a great friend of mine ; he 's a great friend of mine , " he said , almost whispering . "
[303/1000]	his mouth fell open , and i had to take a moment to swallow back the tears . his mother had n't spoken a word since then either . " you do n't know my mother very well ,
[304/1000]	" just a little bit . i ca n't stop thinking about things . " " about what ? " she sighed . " the things that got me into that mess in the first place . i
[305/1000]	the man looked at him , still breathing shallowly and grimacing in pain . " you need some attention , do n't you ? " he got up to start for the door , but suddenly stopped when he saw
[306/1000]	mr. stone smiled and shrugged . " my personal feelings are none of your business . it is not my business of course , but it is my business to tell you , which is why i have sent you
[307/1000]	" how do i look ? " his mouth quirked <EOS> completely with worry . there was nothing to look at him . that was it . " very nicely ... " " wow . " "
[308/1000]	" let me help you , " one of their men said quietly . she turned her head to look at him and then her eyes widened . oh ; it was him . " i need your
[309/1000]	" now , now . remember the last time you came to ask him how to handle a problem with a girl ? " " i 'm sorry . " i 'm about to tell him to forget it
[310/1000]	" you do n't have to sit there and tell me anything about myself when you 're standing here in front of me . we 've got this , skyla . i - i - " " ellis !
[311/1000]	the only thing she could think of was going in search of a toilet , or perhaps a glass of water . when had her last watering ? she hoped her father would get her car cleaned up this morning
[312/1000]	when he would have gone on to the kitchen there was a faint sound to announce the arrival of the staff from the gardens . " is everybody ready ? " nicholas asked with concern . " no one
[313/1000]	that surprised me too . then i asked . " you like him . " she stared at me again . then her gaze flicked to the front door and she took a sip of her coffee .
[314/1000]	james had been good , and he kept his head straight across the gap between them . " you look so happy , " said the black woman . " ah , it 's the way she is
[315/1000]	" that 's right , " my grandmother whispered . she moved her lips away from my cheek to whisper , " what am i going to give you ? " " oh , mom , " i said
[316/1000]	" it 's all right , " the man said . " i get it , really i do , and i go , but if i wanted out of my job , i would never have followed you .
[317/1000]	i stood up . " if you 're sure if you feel like you need to . i just wanted to see you from the back . " " it 's not necessary . " he reached out his
[318/1000]	no matter how i look at it , i 'm not interested in sex . i 'm interested in drugs and sex and pain and heartbreak . i ca n't forgive myself for having those feelings with my sister .
[319/1000]	jason was already in his office , poring over the phone call . " what 's up ? " he asked softly . " they 've arrested the two women that raped me in front of everyone in the
[320/1000]	" and we need to find what the hell is in it ! " " i 'll wait until you get into the lab . " " the hell you will ! i 'll go now , "
[321/1000]	" i did n't want you to see what i had to do to destroy it . you do n't know how hard it was . what you 're dealing with would only make all this worse . i did
[322/1000]	" i am ! it is a good thing you had breakfast . i am starving ! " said gwendolen , her appetite diminished . " is n't there food for anyone else in england ? " said mr.
[323/1000]	" no , that 's not what i 'm saying and you know it . " she huffed a frustrated breath , her hands tightening on her elbows . " then what do you want me to say ?
[324/1000]	the guy looked past my shoulder . his expression made me feel like i ought to know with a degree of certainty whether he was a suspect and his face was chiseled like a chiseled statue . and then he
[325/1000]	i smiled <EOS> ... felt my body and thought i was in love . i could n't hold back a sigh ... looking for the baby dolls , i just realized i did n't even know if i knew
[326/1000]	" i 'd probably better start by asking her if someone else can attend the ceremony . i already told her that tyler is here . i already did a google search last night and discovered things all over town
[327/1000]	there were no eyes , eyes , eyes . the only thing he heard was the voice of the man , but not of the voice of the man . in fact , it was far more than that .
[328/1000]	his lips twisted . " trust me . " " what is it that she said ? " he flashed a wicked grin . " that i do n't care how much you love the taste of my
[329/1000]	" i do n't know . at least not when it comes to my friends ... they are always trying to take advantage of me . they think i like being here for that , because i 'm a bartender
[330/1000]	" i think that 's all for today , so you can go and rest , " he said . " i 'll send someone to get you in next week . " " thanks , doc . i
[331/1000]	" i thought we could visit him tomorrow , " said torus . " let him know we 're home . " nevi smiled and patted him on the arm . " oh , he 's going to
[332/1000]	" he had one foot in that hospital . i need to be with him . " " i 'll try to keep him up , " james says . i lean back against the door . "
[333/1000]	" i 'd say i can get us a few more seats . " the crowd began to move , making room for them , while they passed a row of twenty - something guys and girls in various
[334/1000]	' it 's a start , ' said tiffany as they looked at the chalk and the trees round it . ' the rest are here somewhere . where 'd you see them run ? ' ' the
[335/1000]	she nodded quietly , remembering what she already knew from her conversation with ryan that night . she understood that this was going to be a few days before the next job , and there was no way she was
[336/1000]	" my - my god , there 's another one . and next to it there 's ... " " and there is ? what do you think it is ? " " oh , my god .
[337/1000]	a shadow passed over his face , and he whispered almost absently , " they were angry , they were angry too . the master wanted them to let you think they were angry because they were angry . and
[338/1000]	" well , you already know the answer to all our questions , have n't you ? " the man took out a roll of white paper and unfolded it to reveal an eight by ten sheet of newspaper .
[339/1000]	it made me slightly sad . well , and to be honest , it also made me feel ashamed . because what if i still ran the show ? what if i was the one that left with all these
[340/1000]	i sighed . " well , you could just think of me as my sister , " she said , pushing a few wayward strands from her face . " i do n't care if she 's single and still
[341/1000]	" well , i better go back immediately . it 's pretty late . " " no need . you have been trying to get a date for quite a while , just to be polite , " he
[342/1000]	" this car 's your fault , " he said . " and stop acting like an idiot next time - it 's like i 'm not here . but that 's not the point . " " this
[343/1000]	was she a vampire ? or a demon or a human simply because they had heard her screaming ? either way , she could n't have been an ordinary human . there were n't enough coincidences in the world .
[344/1000]	david - " hello , i 'm david - " " ... " " no , it 's not like that , david . it 's just that there are some terrible things happening out there and i
[345/1000]	the last time i got back on the computer was because mr. brown and the lab technicians had run an experiment on me , so i was stuck . even if they 'd succeeded , how in the world was
[346/1000]	" i 'm sorry , i thought i saw you , " i said , embarrassed , but she simply walked away , disappearing . i started to run after her . " celine ! " she stopped in
[347/1000]	' i 'll be good , ' i promise . ' i 'll live . ' i would n't even have to answer to the goddess , i would just die . and with any luck , and very little
[348/1000]	she smiled down at him . " you have n't answered my question . " " no , you 're right . of course i 'm not married . " his grin was wicked with teasing hints behind it
[349/1000]	" okay , it 's not enough . " her hand crept to her stomach and she looked desperately at the other end . " i 'm going to be such a mother . " she groaned and leaned
[350/1000]	" you 're not supposed to , " charlie answered . " that 's what 's meant to be . " " in some cases there are definite boundaries . " charlie was silent for a moment .
[351/1000]	jack held out his hand . " it 's really nice to meet you . we 're all excited to hear about your engagement . " andrew took his hand and shook it . " that 's very nice
[352/1000]	" you have to admit it bothers you when the situation is wrong ? " " i do not like the way they are going about things . " " did you notice they are talking to each
[353/1000]	" so our boy takes his vitamins and wakes up the next morning ? " the nurse called . " he 's going to wake up and he 's going to ... " the nurse raised her hand in
[354/1000]	" actually , yes , " i said . " i 'll come to be part of this , too . " " i hope you have a good time , mr. parker . " " thank you
[355/1000]	" why not , " i said , laughing . " is that what you 're getting at ? he laughed , too , and added , " maybe it 's your eyes - i 'm not familiar with
[356/1000]	" this has happened before . " " for only your species can you know your future . it is written in your dna . " " that means i have the gene ? " " yes
[357/1000]	" and you had a serious relationship with dr. randall ? " " that was an attempt to get a first call , " he replied dryly . " i did n't find out about it until a few
[358/1000]	" right , " said grace , with a big smile of her own . " can i use the phone , please . " i grabbed my cell out of its perch on the pillow beside me before
[359/1000]	he knew how to play the piano . he could pick up a tune . he had a skill . or , so it seemed to him . he might have to find them a second
[360/1000]	a wave of nausea rippled through me , and i clutched the armrests of my chair , feeling the weight of the world . " you ca n't mean that , " i whispered . " i 'm pretty
[361/1000]	" hey , i 've got a favor to ask you . " " a favor ? " " i need your help . " " oh . okay , anything . anything . " "
[362/1000]	he said nothing . his smile said , " and now that we 've finished our conversation , i was expecting you in here . " " i 'm not getting my way . " " no ,
[363/1000]	he 'd never been in this old house before , his favorite friend brian 's wife . it was only as they left the house behind and headed out on the street that brian realized the house ahead was
[364/1000]	so , i knew dad 's wife . so he did it from time to time because there was some hope . that hope died the day that mom and fin 's family was killed . and that
[365/1000]	<EOS> " yes , i 'm going to have a huge conversation about my new assignment . i 'm going to make the first official stop . i told him to do not to work in the basement . and
[366/1000]	" well ... yeah , i 'll get the kids to bed okay ? we 're all about the kids . anyway , we 've been looking for a way to feed us . " billy nodded , making
[367/1000]	" oh , i did n't mean to upset you . i apologize that i did n't mean to . " " ah . you are accustomed to situations , i see , and always let your feet take
[368/1000]	" i know . " i took a step back . " thank you . " he raised one brow . " if i go back , is there a chance that if i stay here , that
[369/1000]	there was a voice on her mind . she had heard enough of it to know that it was her mother 's . she had a strange feeling in her chest that called to her , not at first ,
[370/1000]	that question i do not wish to answer . i am sure what i want to know is why would something like that happen to a twenty year old girl with everything going on in her life ? "
[371/1000]	a laugh made itself heard over the music . and then , that was it - laughter right there in the middle of it all . i made myself look over and see the others watching her in
[372/1000]	" your job is to show me the inside of a small town . you 're only going ... to deliver my son 's stuff . " the expression on her face told me she did n't like and
[373/1000]	" why do n't you just ... leave me alone . yeah or no ? " " you got me . to stop me from doing what i 'm doing instead , " she replied . i was
[374/1000]	" you are , " she said breathlessly . " and this is my favorite part . " " what is ? " her eyes glinted with an un defined fierceness . " this first time . this
[375/1000]	please . let me do this one thing right . * * * my eyelids were tight , aching . i needed sleep , a few hours on the couch and then i could start the morning .
[376/1000]	both of them did . both looked around at the tree roots and in the corner area under the overhang for some dead leaves the blood had seeped out during a struggle . " what happened to you ?
[377/1000]	" i was playing catch for the football team , which was a good idea , " he said . " what i like best about the game is the team 's concentration on the ball , even though it
[378/1000]	" so ... i suppose all the old ones are gone , " he said with a shrug . i nodded numbly , barely hearing his reply as heat seared my forehead . what he was saying was right
[379/1000]	" as long as there are not any outsiders who can take his place . " " yes , ma'am ! " my father patted john good - bye and returned to his office to write his letter of
[380/1000]	i did n't know what else to do . " i 'm sorry , she 's on the phone with the senator , " he explained . " we 'll try to wait until she 's finished . she
[381/1000]	was it his imagination or was she getting defensive ? the last time they 'd been in a relationship , she 'd made a decision against the possibility of making the same choice . she 'd insisted on her future
[382/1000]	" are you okay ? " i ask quietly . " i 'll be fine , " she says , shaking her head . " look , i 'm sorry i did n't tell you before . i was
[383/1000]	the young woman wore a navy blue evening gown and tied her hair up in a tight chi gnon . her features were too delicate and elegant to be described by a man . she was also attractive and attractive
[384/1000]	" yeah . " " the answer is yes . " my heart was pounding in my chest and the air was starting to feel thick in my lungs . i was just going to have to f
[385/1000]	" that 's where i should be , " i tell him . " i should be at your side . " " but you 're still at school , " i pointed out . " if
[386/1000]	" and what , pray tell , is your problem ? " he says , tilting his head and waiting for an answer . our eyes meet over the backs of both of our chairs . for the first time
[387/1000]	" no , i do n't know what i want from you , and i do n't really want to know . " a moment of silence passed as they looked ahead and back at the car . "
[388/1000]	" what am i going to do with this ? " " just tell them you found nothing and will bring in the next team to fill you in . if you need them you can call them today
[389/1000]	" then do not fear my wrath . if i see you near him again or his family , i will kill you myself . do you understand ? " she nodded , her terror of having him in
[390/1000]	which of course was probably why he 'd bought this wedding gown , and he wanted her , too . the idea of a lifetime of having her in his bed all day long was his undoing . chapter
[391/1000]	" when was the last time you spoke to robert ? " " two weeks ago , " she says . " i went to see him today . " " what did he say ? "
[392/1000]	instead of calling him on it , i texted him instead . " not a good idea getting back together with that guy you 've been seeing . " " and i have n't seen you since you told
[393/1000]	" why ca n't i get closer ? " the big kid whined . " they all are . " alex stood above them , still calmly gazing down , and said , " he ca n't say any
[394/1000]	she turned away from him and walked to her locker , pushing the big book that she kept inside a locker with her hip . she had a thing for mr. stone , but he 's right . he did
[395/1000]	the moment his lips were in touch with hers he tasted her . fire licked at her flesh as the blood rushed straight to her hips and slid between her legs . he stilled . hesitated . she
[396/1000]	i did n't get to tell anyone what had happened and never got an opportunity to tell them why i was late . i also never got to tell anyone why the police hauled me to the station and
[397/1000]	" yes , " she said , " i 'm your employee . no need for explanations . " she nodded at the door . " that 's the only thing i can offer you . " " i
[398/1000]	" a secret door ? " " of course not if you wanted to get out of here . " he reached to help her out of the hummer and she resisted the instinct to turn her body into
[399/1000]	' i ... ' she glanced behind her and down the wall . she had stopped , not directly in front of the entrance . it was out of sight . ' what ? ' he demanded .
[400/1000]	emma was the last person to show any concern for her mother after the event ... and she obviously felt differently . " actually , i 'm not sure you remember . maybe i should go first . "
[401/1000]	he 'd hoped to cut me loose tonight . instead , i was supposed to hang around and take the heat - i 'd learned a few tricks of late . no one would even notice , but i really
[402/1000]	i raised my hand and put it over her lips . i pressed my thumb down on her lips . it did n't hurt . i heard her suck in a long , shaky breath . the feeling in my
[403/1000]	" i do n't have one . is there somewhere we can talk ? " he asked the agent . " is there any way i can collect my stuff first ? " " of course , " the
[404/1000]	" i called , did n't i ? " i was only half listening . " i thought you hated this . " " i do . " it felt as if i was going to snap if
[405/1000]	" thank you , ma'am , " i said . " do n't mention it , " she said with a tight smile before stepping out into the hall . i followed suit . the silence inside was
[406/1000]	when i open my eyes i see stars stretching up through the ceiling and stars filling the room . i 'm on my back and one of his hands is on my neck and the other is in my hair
[407/1000]	now , i was coming to the conclusion that i really could n't spend hours getting to know the people in the business or know them , so i could n't imagine the way they 'd feel , no matter
[408/1000]	i took a quick intake of breath . i knew what she was offering , and whether or not i was ready for it , i knew i did not want it . yet she was offering me something ,
[409/1000]	" okay . " another long pause to let his words sink in . once they 'd settled in , there would be no talking . " we were at the store for the third time , and i -
[410/1000]	" maybe , if he were mine , " i muttered . " this is hardly an act , " cole snapped . " he 's married , for crying out loud ! " i tried not to
[411/1000]	" i just want to thank him . as you know , i wo n't be able to buy you another chair because i 'm out of the running now you work with mr. marshall . " " hey
[412/1000]	the man 's smile faded . " go to hell . " before he could react , her hand was over the guy 's mouth . " no more talk . " the smile came back . "
[413/1000]	i felt my ears prickle , and all of a sudden i knew who she was . i did n't even bother with a false smile . " oh , i 'm sure the last person who called your
[414/1000]	" fuck , " he grunts and slams down on his c * * k again . " fuck , you feel good . fuck , i ca n't hold on . " his h * ps push into my
[415/1000]	' have n't had it , did you ? at least you have n't drank it . ' he did n't sound a bit sorry . ' i have n't had the ale , either , at all
[416/1000]	then some weird bastard hit the floor , the metal of the elevator biting into his neck and slicing open the skin , and the man stood on his chest , fangs ready on his throat . the demon had
[417/1000]	" it is not . we all must live with the consequences . but i would like to see him try . it will be a wonderful event , i always think . i would advise you all to be
[418/1000]	" yeah . i 'm done for today . go do your thing . " he did . i picked up our trays and sat down . i put my book back in my bag and started back
[419/1000]	" and are you okay in that dress ? " he asks . " i 'm okay , " i admit in just as slightly false a voice as i am feeling . " i mean , yeah ,
[420/1000]	" but because i missed the holidays . after her brother died ... my dad has n't gone into the business again . he still owns a good chunk of the neighborhood . he lets me have as much as
[421/1000]	" so why do n't you let me take two if i 'm not ready to let you up , okay ? " i asked , as i maneuvered out of his grasp . " okay . " he
[422/1000]	' just so . ' there was some more of the same conversation , with two or three of these men nodding and nodding their heads at different points in the conversation . there was even a little whispering
[423/1000]	" no luck tracking any tracking dogs we know of ? " kyle asked . i shook my head . " i am now at the very top of the mountain . " kyle perked up . "
[424/1000]	she was n't sure how it was possible , the shock was so great it was almost too much for her to process . " i ca n't believe it , " she said . " he actually said
[425/1000]	" why do n't you ask her yourself ? she will tell you all about it . oh , there 's one other thing . " he picked a new gun up and flicked it shut . " do n't
[426/1000]	" why did n't you tell me you have such a fondness for birds ? " she stopped with one hand on the wall , the other hand gripping the wall beside her . her eyes lit up and
[427/1000]	" i meant , if the weather impro ves . " " will do , " ty lied , setting the glass down and leaning back against the counter . he sighed . " come on , let 's
[428/1000]	he looked down at me , his hand sliding up my thigh so he could cup my bottom . both his blue eyes staring deep into mine as his thumb slid back and forth under my shirt , and for
[429/1000]	he ran a hand through his dark blond hair , his eyes glittering . " so you 're not going to go into the town anymore ? " she blinked , confused . " what - i mean .
[430/1000]	" but he wanted to marry . " " is that why he would n't ? " " maybe . " " why not ? " " because he could n't do a thing about it
[431/1000]	" i do not speak of it . " a long moment passed . she did n't seem to hear him and even then , he had to lean against the railing . " i 'm not certain i
[432/1000]	the next morning i sat up bright and early . because it was my day off , i would n't get to go , and i knew he would n't be happy with me leaving . plus dad and mom
[433/1000]	" that 's good . i need to know , " they said in unison . " i need the money . " " what do you want ? " asked one of the other men .
[434/1000]	" but it 's so crazy here ! " she burst out , before i could respond . " are you familiar with the forest by any chance or is it just myths that make it that dangerous ? "
[435/1000]	" it 's okay , " seth said , patting his sister on the arm . " we 'll do this together . " he watched as sam and michael broke ranks and went back to sit next to
[436/1000]	ryan looked like he was about to say something , but i put my finger up to my lips . " let me finish . you know i hate talking about anything but me getting married . " he
[437/1000]	" yes yes you are , " the girl grinned . " why do n't you come along and we 'll get our stuff together and you can show me around . " " how did you learn ?
[438/1000]	" i 've seen what it can do , " he said . " i know what it can do . if i 'm going to die , i 'll die strong . i will not let anything stop me
[439/1000]	it has to be her . he pulls his hat down low over his eyes . the car roars when he pulls the car to the curb . he gets out and leans against the side of
[440/1000]	" yes , it does . he 's dead . i 've called you earlier , not expecting you to answer . " " it bothers me - " " i 'm right here , " he interrupts
[441/1000]	" he was my friend , and i 've treated him like a friend , all for the sake of getting answers . he got out my soul , and i did n't know how to let him go back
[442/1000]	" come on , " he says , and moves toward the front of the house . chapter sixty - one i 'm not sure if this is a good idea , but i find myself following him
[443/1000]	" i 'll handle it , " nick said . he flipped himself over , taking her in his arms with both hands <EOS> " to help . " " just like old times , " she managed to
[444/1000]	" you want to know why i 'm here ? why i 'm in your den ? " i ask . he 's silent , watching me closely but not at me . " why you 're here ?
[445/1000]	" here , take this . " his voice was soft so as not to startle her . he put the bag and the package on the sofa , and he followed her into the kitchen . rachel opened
[446/1000]	" i think there 's a pretty good chance that you are in serious danger , " said the pilot . " danger ? i see a lot of danger . what is it ? are you both coming
[447/1000]	" just get back in your seat and keep out of the way . " john 's jaw tightened . " he has a point . you should n't have to do this alone . " " it
[448/1000]	" when is this ? " " a few days . " " what 's the price ? " peter grinned , " it 's pretty good , " he laughed . " what does that old
[449/1000]	he lifted his head . " what ? no . i do n't want that . " he ran his hands up and down her arms . the warmth of them was more than enough to pull her into his
[450/1000]	" you can let all the details out in the report , " the defense attorney told him with cool efficiency . " but , i have a big job for you today . there is a new prosecutor in
[451/1000]	" just wanted to make sure you got around ok . " " sorry . my aunt is here . she has been trying to get me to meet her . " i give her a wink .
[452/1000]	" get out of here ! " a deep , menacing male voice echoed from the direction of the living area . we stood with our mouths agape a moment and then all at once we sprung into action
[453/1000]	" and you 're fine with all this ? " sam asked . " it 's okay . the thing is , i came to see if cole , jace , lucas and lucas would be happy to be
[454/1000]	my father 's arm was around my shoulders . i do n't know how , but whatever tears were about to come came to my eyes . " did you know ? " he asked his son .
[455/1000]	my hand flies to my mouth . that 's a hell of a shock . i can see declan 's anger building behind his handsome face . " what did you do to her ? " shannon says angrily
[456/1000]	" why do n't you do something crazy like go and have some fun ? " he asked , watching as she scurried back into a shed . " what ? " she asked , instantly confused .
[457/1000]	" how could i not ? it 's that important . " she frowned . " how come , even if the three of us have gone through some type of ... problem at school , they still come
[458/1000]	" you 've found her . i 'll tell ya . " " yeah , yeah , i know . when 's she due ? " " october 17th . " " january first ? "
[459/1000]	" i called you a jerk a few times in the past , but those were all because of sam , right ? " " yeah , but you were actually right . did i mention he can be
[460/1000]	a woman in her forties got out , wearing scrubs . " i 'm officer sarah hunter , mr. , " she said . " it 's nice to meet you . " " i 'm officer jim
[461/1000]	we watched , and he took my hand so i could tell the score , but he did n't kiss me . so i made the mistake of kissing him back , and then all of a sudden it
[462/1000]	the way he looked at me made me forget the rest of the world as i fell so irrevocably into his stare . i might have fallen even more in love with him . but i 'd not
[463/1000]	a couple more moments of silence . " shit . " " what ? " " i do n't think i 've ever seen him eat so quickly . " " like most people , he
[464/1000]	he went to the kitchen and found the wine , poured himself some , and followed it up with a slice of a delicious brie . two pieces , the entire six feet . the whole brie was toasted with
[465/1000]	" you saw her first ? " " sort of . her dad never even married her , and she was n't even out of a case until she . . . ah , changed . " they
[466/1000]	she stared at him . " really . how ? " " the kind of thing that would drive me crazy . " so why did it feel so damned good ? " i 'm just a little hungry
[467/1000]	" what 's that you said about our son coming from the wrong place and making a terrible mistake ... " said the president with a hint of anger in his voice . " if he 's in a bad
[468/1000]	" yeah . you 'll have to show me ? i 've got two extra pairs . " " sorry . " her cheeks turned pink , and she looked down at the deck . she seemed embarrassed by
[469/1000]	" a word of advice , " zane said , glancing at the coffee pot . " do n't let him know about that . " " what ? " " put the two bottles aside . make
[470/1000]	he moved to shut the door and stop . " i want to help . " she faced him . " is that what i want ? or wo n't you leave me with the boys ? " she
[471/1000]	and it was , she was sure . he raised a shoulder . " it was n't until we were about five years old and i finally found out who my best friend was . a girl i 'd
[472/1000]	" yeah . i need to rest . " " you get enough sleep . and i have a suggestion . will you come over with me in my car and let me drive ? " i put on
[473/1000]	he looks back at me . is he angry ? yeah . angry enough to attack my best friend ? what 's the big deal ? " one question at a time , " he says . " would
[474/1000]	" where 'd you come from ? " i asked , suddenly feeling like an ass . " my father decided to call this an exclusive club . we 're opening by the name of club x so we
[475/1000]	no , <EOS> she had <EOS> to see . her heart told her she 'd not be able to see him for years . it did not . she could have been dead when she
[476/1000]	" oh , shut up ! you 're going to jinx us , " she said . " it 'll probably be your end . " " tell me something i do n't know , " he said .
[477/1000]	not until you are certain you do n't have an affair . i 'm an honest man . i 'm probably a lot better than you and i 've handled everything as if i 'd been married to you all
[478/1000]	" i understand , " i say . " okay , well what i really want to know about is . . . do you think you 'd feel comfortable if something happened to me in your position ?
[479/1000]	" what about a picture ? " asked colton . was he crazy ? these people were from the future ! bernam looked at him in surprise . " yes ? " " you 're not insane
[480/1000]	" i trust you , " i said , then stopped and considered . i had a theory on what might have happened if rachel had n't called him to tell on me , but i 'd given him my
[481/1000]	they were at the main main airport , a strip of white sand bordered by a circle of water . the white building beckoned them , and jack led the way inside . when he stepped off the jet
[482/1000]	" and after that ? you 're going to kick me out ? " " no , not at all . i 'm merely saying i am worried about you . i 'm telling you that i am in
[483/1000]	she walked home . it was n't as bad as it had been . there was a lot of people outside . even the occasional officer was out as you approached the building . she only paused to walk
[484/1000]	" it is alright , son . we are all happy on our home front , and he , is also happy when he gets a phone call and he finds out his wife - to - be has died
[485/1000]	" god , when ya wanna call me a man ? " logan winked , then stepped toward the elevator . he pressed the button and looked over at her . " good thing i know cpr . you 're
[486/1000]	i had to admit , however many men had played the game for a living , both by circumstance and skill , sometimes successfully just through the simple expedi ency of living without a woman . i had never
[487/1000]	" where are the rest of you , anyway ? " clary demanded . jia looked at her as if there had been something on her face clary had n't noticed before . " we 're in idris ,
[488/1000]	not liking the tone of his voice , she stood . " i also gave you some instructions . i want to know what 's going on here , is something wrong , and you 're going to tell
[489/1000]	" i think that 's just a rumor . if we had to guess , he would have said the same . " " where has he been ? " " his bedroom . " " let
[490/1000]	" thanks for coming , chris . it really must be nice to finally spend some quality time with someone . " " for sure . i 'm sorry i was n't here earlier . i really enjoyed seeing
[491/1000]	" i 'm just saying - this ai n't a club any more , as far as i can tell ! " " she walked in here , on her own , " he said . " that
[492/1000]	the old man was dead , too - murdered . his daughter was standing in front of him , her face pale and terrified . he reached out to her . " no , " she screamed
[493/1000]	" will you listen to me . you ca n't tell me - you ca n't tell me no . it 's the only way , you ca n't say no to me . " she wanted to be
[494/1000]	" that is n't what you said . " " so you think i 'm the kind to lose my temper ? well , that 's exactly what i was going to suggest . " he walked far enough
[495/1000]	a new face popped up and sat down in an empty chair right next to hers . maybe more than one , as she looked at the books on the shelves surrounding her . " you 're a natural
[496/1000]	" i have no idea , <EOS> i just saw no one in the crowd . " they continued on their way to the building that housed the office . a short time later , the door opened and
[497/1000]	" is that what they were doing when they died ? do you think so ? " asked the driver . " i mean ... " " i 'm sure they were , " answered the man . "
[498/1000]	" but you ca n't tell anyone , " i said . " your family will be angry at you . " i just had to be careful . i had to be careful what i said next . "
[499/1000]	which is when someone knocked on the door . " who is it ? " i asked , pushing the door open . " it 's about john and lily . can i come in ? " "
[500/1000]	and there they were . his dad was perched on the corner of the sofa , holding a beer and smiling , and the twins , taylor , and matt were dancing together . <EOS> his dad was holding
[501/1000]	the next room was another long , featureless hallway , this time lined with doors : men at arms , women at arms , and a few girls , all dressed in white gowns and in the same black ribbons
[502/1000]	there had to be some kind of mistake , and no one else could have done it , so her fear was understandable . i could only hope that she had n't been put in the middle of a fight
[503/1000]	" no need for that , " she said . gabriel pulled her down on his waiting lips . gabriel made love to her for hours that night . he learned more about her , told her more about
[504/1000]	" we never had any trouble with that kind of thing . " " well then i 'm glad you think they can be relied on . if they ca n't , i 'm afraid we 're going to
[505/1000]	" or not . " she nodded and went to stand as far away from him as possible . " you did n't mean for things to turn out this way . " " i 'm not
[506/1000]	" i 'm okay , " she said eventually , but the lie sounded weak and weak under her tongue . " i think i 'll hang out here . " " but what about your mother ? "
[507/1000]	" i guess i did . " she lifted her shoulders . " and i wish i did n't , by the same token . " " me too . i 'd be up past my ankles , otherwise
[508/1000]	she sat up and started to go to the corner of the room , to get a tissue if necessary , but did n't move . " i 'm sorry , honey . i should have called you . "
[509/1000]	his arms crept up me until they were lying between my br * * sts and i felt his taut n * * ples brushing my chest . " can we come in ? " he asked , pulling
[510/1000]	the man chuckled . " i love the way it is . but i 'm not one for romance . " tara wanted to believe the man but the idea of tara 's feelings for robert annoyed her .
[511/1000]	" what ? ? ? " replied gregor . " because you have no idea ? did n't anyone tell you ? " gregor thought it best to bring it up when it was clear . " we all
[512/1000]	" does the company like me well enough to supply me with a gift for the upcoming year ? " i asked . " i 'll probably be sending me a letter saying that you 're coming . "
[513/1000]	i looked at that , shocked and confused , my mind spinning . and then , it dawned on me that she might be standing next to jesse , sharing his bed . i backed myself into a corner
[514/1000]	" yes , we ca n't do it myself . that was easier just to lie to them , especially after they told me we needed to go through with it that day . once we made contact , we
[515/1000]	but it 's no use . i 'm crying again , at least , because i know she 's right . dad was n't the only one i cried for - not anymore . even when mom died ,
[516/1000]	" but he 's been missing for weeks . " " i know , i 'm just frustrated . it seems like the guy is n't going to speak to us . " " you 're right ,
[517/1000]	that was nice of him . maybe he finally sensed that this was n't a place for me . it , like most people , was n't what i wanted . i pulled the robe closed and headed back to
[518/1000]	" i do n't know , really . " " what is your real name ? " my mind raced through all the possible answers . " oh , um , i have to confess it to you
[519/1000]	" do it , " i said suddenly . " do it . " " oh , dear god , " she whispered , and the water got even colder . all the way down to the bottom of
[520/1000]	" i do n't have to kill so i can get some food because you 're a girl , " i said . " so i 'm going to keep an eye on your friend here until the sun rises
[521/1000]	" good luck , " he said to me as he crossed the street . " do n't you mean the money saved for college ? " " not as long as what money you 're making goes
[522/1000]	" so ... you want me to make love to you ? " she asked , her br * * sts heaving against his chest . " yes . i want to get you naked , taste you ,
[523/1000]	" but the book ? " " you told me that you do n't have a library , which means that it was n't an accident . let me pull it out and show you . " he brought
[524/1000]	" he was going to have a girl . " she put her finger to her mouth . " shh , " she said . " it 's all right . " john watched as john leaned over
[525/1000]	" so i did . " she smiled sweetly . " ah , so you 're here too . " he looked at her for a moment and looked back at the girls . " this wo n't take
[526/1000]	that 's <EOS> " " huh ? " " what 's wrong with your favorite movie and not what i thought it would be . " " you do n't know . i have to look for
[527/1000]	" you were too quick to react to the gunshot . " " i did n't leave on my skateboard , i was in the wrong place at the wrong time . one minute you 'd be running across
[528/1000]	" that 's a good idea ! you can help everybody if you 'd like , " he said . " how many people know ? " " it might be some , " joe said . "
[529/1000]	" hey , baby , " i said into her ear as i climbed out of bed and set her down . she was still snuggled up to me , so i took her hand and led her outside .
[530/1000]	the last two months the world is full of people who are a part of life and often from a place of fear and danger . they are young people . they see this . they do not understand .
[531/1000]	alex turned toward the door . " when ? " one of the policemen shouted over the roar of the motorcycle . " right now ! it 's urgent ! " alex yelled back through the opening .
[532/1000]	he touched the base of my neck , and his eyes were just inches away . " i 've never met a girl like you before . what would i do without you ? " i smiled , and
[533/1000]	i felt his body relax under me and my arms curved around him . he shifted so that his c * * k was in my face . " we 're good together , " i told him .
[534/1000]	" so , where can we get some coffee ? " " here , in memphis ? " eddie asked . " do you even know why we 're here ? " " of course not !
[535/1000]	" the other option is that she could end up in a hospital . " she grimaced . " that 's a hell of a place to live . " he nodded . " give me your
[536/1000]	" you can have anything you want . look around from every angle . it 's all you need ! " " well i 'm not taking your money . " " please , your daughter would love
[537/1000]	" you do n't have to stay here , sarah , " sarah said gently . " i 'll stay with you . i may be old , " she added . " but i 'm not stupid . i
[538/1000]	" hey . " a moment later , he had her in his arms and they were kissing in the kitchen . " something wrong ? " she asked . " nope . when the hell did
[539/1000]	a moment later he pulled the covers up around them . * jake heard the deep thuds of footsteps entering the room . from over his shoulder he heard a loud shriek and the thud of something hitting
[540/1000]	his heart and his resolve hardened at the mention of her name in his thoughts . " no . i 'm afraid you 'll ruin everything . " sarah had lived in the bayou all her life , but
[541/1000]	" why would you do such a thing ? " " because i 'm in this ! i 'm the one who killed her ! " she felt the rage building inside of gavin . " no ,
[542/1000]	i was n't even sure how i got back to the club . i must have been walking . finally i found myself in front of the door i had entered earlier . it was open , and the door
[543/1000]	" i wo n't deny , and yes , i 'd like to meet you , too . you probably have some questions that i do n't want to answer yet , but i think that to get answers from
[544/1000]	she reached for the door handle . as she leaned out , her knees wobbled and she glanced back to make sure he did n't notice . had he pulled her in for sex ? while it was nothing
[545/1000]	i grinned . " yeah , i saw you . you 're here now . " he threw his head back and laughed . " you 're the one who called it in to help . " "
[546/1000]	" i 'm not going anywhere , " he said . " i do n't want to stay here , and i do n't want to stay . " he looked around . " how do you make things different
[547/1000]	" i like that , " she muttered . " how much will your father see ? " " i do n't know . " he shrugged and sat back . " he does n't seem to care .
[548/1000]	<EOS> " damn , " i muttered . " i 've always been good at picking up on women 's nuances - but , dammit , i do n't . " an obvious answer , as would have been
[549/1000]	" you got it , " he says . " but what 's next ? maybe there 's nothing more " " maybe there is . when the time comes i 'll make you a deal , " i
[550/1000]	" would n't have done any good . i was n't his official wife to start with . " " no ? " " no , " she said . neagley was her receptionist at the lennox
[551/1000]	" this is n't a very large bed frame , you know . " " there 's no reason for me to have this bed built , " he said as he dropped to the hard floor . for
[552/1000]	" hello , " he said , smiling now . " alex ! i brought food ! " said the little boy with hair and eyes that darted around at the table like a caged thing . "
[553/1000]	" they are supposed to be here , " mary said . " i know what they are . " " then why are you in such a hurry ? " cranston replied impatiently . and he was
[554/1000]	you already know how much i love this club , but i want you to be there with me . in a club , in my own club . be there with me and take on the details . i
[555/1000]	she made some comment about the size of the universe and how awesome it was . then she laughed a little . " there was one joke i had n't told anyone . a movie i had n't even been
[556/1000]	" god ! " i screamed . " what have i done ? " i reached a hand out to him and he shook it . i felt a sudden connection with him . i felt his confidence ,
[557/1000]	" i do n't believe you . " i pointed to his hands . " i do n't think you can take the bullet . just tell me what to do . " he shook his head and gripped
[558/1000]	" i need to talk to him . " " he 's having your blood . " " i know . " " go talk to him . " " i ca n't . i have
[559/1000]	' well so much so that we all got our throats cut when they did , ' minos said . ' come on girls , we 're going back . ' i heard music so i followed him into
[560/1000]	" if you think people like to play games , you 're crazier than i thought , " said the old man in his gravelly voice with mock authority as he adjusted his black bowler hat . " what
[561/1000]	if i had a chance of winning it over ? nope , the chance had died long ago . i was n't so sure of that anymore . i was n't so sure of anything anymore ,
[562/1000]	" no , sir , " jack said , " i 'm sorry . " jack walked back , carrying a steaming tray . everyone looked at it in curiosity , but he kept up his act . so
[563/1000]	i leaned up against his wall , resting my head on one hand as i listened . i could hear several hands moving around in the kitchen . the men outside had returned with something . when i listened carefully
[564/1000]	" i asked for it ! i want it ! " beth shouted from the crowd . " be careful with her ! " mark stood over her , but she had n't begun to struggle . "
[565/1000]	and from up the street , i heard the rumble of voices chanting to each other . i was n't quite sure what it meant , but it seemed to put two and two together - and i knew who
[566/1000]	" do you see it ? " daniel asked . " yes . " " is that it ? " " yes . " " it 's gorgeous . " i stared back at him
[567/1000]	she took the empty mug from his hand and pulled him by the shoulder , bringing his face up to hers . " i like you . if i ca n't seem to put down my anger within myself ,
[568/1000]	his father gave a sigh . " and here you have us confused with those in the city . have n't you ever heard it was better that there be a king instead of a king and our son had
[569/1000]	" <EOS> " his response to me , " which i believe is more personal than a greeting and his answers to my series of question marks . all of the guys were hard on her . " "
[570/1000]	i could n't fathom how these people would survive it - and i could n't imagine how that would always end . of course , they were n't exactly my crowd - and most of the stories i 'd heard
[571/1000]	" thank you , jake , " she said and sat at the kitchen table . he placed plates in front of her and walked to the coffeemaker , where he filled two cups . they watched the tv .
[572/1000]	the question hung open - unspoken - and she fought her way through it . now . her voice was heavy with fatigue as she pointed at the bed . " would you believe me if i told you
[573/1000]	" oh , i had no idea it was going to be so sensitive . " " he said it was a classic . i 'm sorry i did this . " " do n't be sorry .
[574/1000]	" you 'll just have to pay before you get the job done , " he warns , walking away from us . " the real work is that beautiful . " as he walks onto the dance floor
[575/1000]	my eyes bugged . if a lot of vamps were gay , my father would be one big ass hypocrite . " hello ? " i murmured . why were there four vampires ? damn , i 'd thought
[576/1000]	' you 're wearing a suit and tie , ' said harry . ' should n't you be indoors in bed ? ' ' i have n't had much sleep . ' ' well , perhaps you should
[577/1000]	a sharp chill went down her spine . " no , i mean this case , " he explained , tugging her back in the chair where she 'd last seen her uncle . " it 's about money
[578/1000]	he tried to smile in response . " i 'm afraid not . i wo n't be here long . " she gave a firm shake of her head , her voice filled with resolve and the edge of
[579/1000]	i felt my eyebrows pull together , but i was intrigued to see her reaction - not to mention i knew she was curious as to the subject matter . suddenly , a brilliant idea popped into my head
[580/1000]	" it is my goal to go to moscow on one day and kill the bastard who killed my daughter . " " you do not want this . and yet ... i do want it . " the
[581/1000]	' god save us ! ' then someone , finally ! someone on the other side of that cell , someone who had never been out of an early set of eyes . the man who stood above
[582/1000]	" let 's sit down . " she motioned for me to sit across from her with her glass of juice . i did n't know where else to go . my head was killing me by the time
[583/1000]	" and the man who took my sister ? where is he now ? " and , like a child , she 'd had the luxury of time to wonder , to wonder how she 'd found him here
[584/1000]	it was n't a question , really . still , she did n't answer at first . her thoughts were so jumbled , she could n't come up with anything to say . so she sat there , watching him
[585/1000]	she waited for the punch line . " is there a dead girl ? " he asked . " not yet . " a woman in her forties . a tall woman with long curly red hair .
[586/1000]	" the truth , " he pleaded . " and i need the gun to prove that i 'm wrong . you tell me what i need to prove . in exchange , i 'll take two things from
[587/1000]	he kissed my forehead , then the corner of my mouth , then closed his eyes . " we had such a good time , " he murmured , his lips moving against my temple . " yes ,
[588/1000]	" no , " i responded . " and it 's not as if they 're here to discuss why i like to talk about you , not really . " i glanced over toward the restaurant ,
[589/1000]	" just wanted to make sure you 're okay . " " i 'm fine . i 'm just tired . did you happen to get to meet our new cook ? " " she 's not as
[590/1000]	that 's more like it . i love her and i love our daughter , and that 's all that matters . but i ca n't say that the end is near . i need to be more careful
[591/1000]	" yes , sir , " the lawyer replied . " just pull it off , " the judge said . " this may be a new thing to both you and your client . sometimes things will get
[592/1000]	" not exactly . " colin 's voice was wary . " what does ' yes ' mean when you say you 'll never be out of here for long ? or when the time comes when you can finally
[593/1000]	he reached into his pocket , pulled out a folded piece of paper and carefully put it in my hand . " i want you to go to dr. scott 's office . you 're the primary resident physician
[594/1000]	" i 'm sorry too , " he said quietly . " have you ever been here before ? " " of course not . " she felt slightly defensive . " it was just the first time i
[595/1000]	" that 's not right . " my stomach drops like it came out of the ground . " no - " i 'm sorry , but i have to go back . i'l explain later . "
[596/1000]	she paused in the doorway . she 'd been prepared to move on , but he reached over for her hand and squeezed it tightly . " it 's okay to hold on to me . " she let
[597/1000]	he could n't feel anything but his hand , his fingers clenching on the counter . the blood rushing through his veins kept beating him flat . his father . " why ? " shane continued . one
[598/1000]	" what happened ? " i demanded at last . " he ... he ... he ... it was just what my parents wanted for us . just like they wanted what everyone else wanted - to have our

[609/1000]	" what 's wrong , baby boy ? " asked a female voice from his right hand . " did you feel the jolt of desire to eat ? " asked the woman with a friendly smile . "
[610/1000]	" so , have you found any new clues to the location of the man with the snake ? " his questions came out on a ragged rush . " he 's been missing for several weeks , "
[611/1000]	" his mother did n't do it , " he said quietly to the window in the kitchen as his phone rang . one moment he would have believed she 'd gone straight to bed . with her arms

[618/1000]	" why do you hate them so ? they 're decent people and you think of them only as enemies . " " i do n't hate them , but they were n't right for my job . "

[628/1000]	" i know ! it 'll be easy ! " with that , jared walked out the door , leaving me with a pair of men standing at the door . as i turned to go , one said
[629/1000]	he made his way carefully through the narrow path that wound between the four buildings in the middle of town , keeping to the shadows . his only hope was that the street was deserted , no one would see
[630/1000]	my breathing caught and my muscles tensed with anticipation . i had to feel his stubble on my skin , feel his weight on me . braydon reached over and took my coffee cup , tipping the cup so

[634/1000]	" mr. be de man ? " he pushed the image and his office back into the image of his partner 's office . " yes ? " " can you believe you want to tell me
[635/1000]	" is he dead ? " i ask . " not yet . i caught a couple of bits of shrapnel along his spine when he fell . " " i had a sudden flashback in the bathroom
[636/1000]	" i am just telling you what you need to know about your job , " he replied . he pulled out a set of silver coins and began to slide them across the table toward one of the serving

[646/1000]	" i saw him today at work , but i did n't ask him anything , at all , " kim said with an air of superiority . kim 's words stung lyssa so much she was shocked that
[647/1000]	i laugh . " no , i mean , he put my money in there . " my mother blinks . her eyes widen , and fear ripples through her . her eyes sweep around again until she finds
[648/1000]	" how are you doing ? " " better , " he said , smiling shyly . " we 're having so much fun . " " i 'm okay . " " i do n't
[649/1000]	" and i swear ' i 'll make this right ' against her . " i whispered the words , wanting to believe him as much as i could , but knowing this was n't the time or the place
[650/1000]	he caught sight of a new woman . a tall woman in striking robes , or something . his senses told him she was one of the people who 'd arrived . he saw her hands shaking as she tried
[651/1000]	just as he was about to tell ty " s eyes who he " d really like to know now anyway , a sudden movement behind ty stopped his entire world . zane whirled to see one of the agents
[652/1000]	" sorry , no luck . are you going to tell me when and where ? " " right now , i have to put my pants back on , " he smiled . " do you have
[653/1000]	the guy stared at him dumbly one more - as blood burst from his lip . trace 's breath heaved out . " that 's an old wound i 've been giving you . but if you get
[654/1000]	you look quite fine yourself with your white hair about your shoulders . ' ' thanks , ma'am , ' he said politely . ' some of it 's blood too . ' he drew back as one
[655/1000]	his grip relaxed , suddenly . " i ... i did n't know you were there , " i said , trying to recover slowly . a single tear ran down my cheek , as i straightened up and
[656/1000]	" the men are here , " she murmured , " they come and go on foot . " as the sound of boots falling against the boards did nothing to comfort the girl , all thoughts of the
[657/1000]	i had to say i was a little impressed , but my reaction should have been something else . i 'd seen him with other women , knew exactly how talented he was , and yet i 'd never thought
[658/1000]	my lungs felt like they were taking too long . " thank you , " i said , trying to sound almost as sincere as i could . had i made them look more believable than it was in
[659/1000]	" then i find myself in the place of , ' my lord ' is the correct term - " the door swung open . at that exact moment the king 's carriage entered . the man inside
[660/1000]	" that 's where you come down , honey . on the floor , next to mama . " " are you sure ? " then i realized how insensitive i had been . " yes . i
[661/1000]	" i 'm not sleeping with anyone , and unless the old fart here wants a picture of me . " he paused . " anyway . i have to go . " olivia , who usually tried to

[664/1000]	the man stopped a few paces from where his partner leaned against the wall , laughing . " right now , if it were n't for this two - by - four , we only would have a few moments
[665/1000]	" mr. miller ! " a voice cut through the noise . " what are you doing on our track team ? " " i 'm just taking a break ! " miller held up his arm in the
[666/1000]	" just be careful , okay ? " " okay , " she said and went to stand by the back of the bench . " i 'm going , " she said . i went to the
[667/1000]	her mother was n't like that . she was n't worried . but now she had to convince her mother that her mother had n't done anything wrong . " i 'm sorry , mom . " lexie leaned
[668/1000]	" if you 're going to try and use your powers to be good at it , you have to learn to use them better , " said silas . " let me get this straight . you want
[669/1000]	" that 's why you brought me here . i think that if there 's one thing i hate more than anyone else here , it 's a failure of a way to become a world leader . "
[670/1000]	" i 'm sure she 's very distraught . " " what did she happen to ? " " i 'm sure she does n't know . perhaps you should approach her alone . " " her
[671/1000]	" i meant a few days out . " she was silent . he was silent . <EOS> ... and the woman was standing , looking over the whole time , and thinking . if it
[672/1000]	he does , and with purpose . the look that appears on his face when he opens the door is enough to let me know he is ready . i nod to the guards at the door as i say
[673/1000]	" i 'm going to try and figure something out . " " okay , " he said , finally finding his voice , " when we get there , make sure you turn off the lights . "
[674/1000]	" that was not a threat to me , " she gasped , horrified . " oh , i know . the only threat you 're getting is me . you should be thankful i 'm not physically controlling
[675/1000]	" what ? " " you said the first time i saw you , you 'd never seen a sidhe . " " no , " olaf said . i had the feeling he was trying to
[676/1000]	her eyes closed and she started screaming out words that made his heart stop and start to pound . he wrapped his hands into her hair , holding her to him and bringing her down on top of him .
[677/1000]	the first explosion was n't directed at them . nor was it directed at anyone . instead , it was aimed at one of the fire fighters . but that explosion had come from the opposite way , from
[678/1000]	they watched the horizon as the sun rose higher in the sky . " i think you put the pressure on . " " the pressure ? " " i think you 've been in this long
[679/1000]	the old man opened a large black bag and took out a thin envelope . he opened it carefully and spilled the contents onto his small . the old man slowly placed the paper into <EOS> un winds like a
[680/1000]	" what 've you been fighting about ? " i could tell that as soon as he was ready to talk about it , he knew something was wrong , and so did i . so i decided to
[681/1000]	" fine . i 'll go alone . " " will i see you this week ? " she asked . " yes . and i can show up alone , " he replied . " okay
[682/1000]	" you got it , bro . i doubt she has time to deal with us . " he sighs heavily . " where the fuck is she ? did you hear what she said ? do n't worry ,
[683/1000]	we were on the second - floor landing , and he was in front of me . we should have stayed at his place . it was the fastest way to get back to my room . but somehow
[684/1000]	" i know who they are , but - " he closed his eyes against the pain . " if they were <EOS> - " " they were n't . " the words could n't be said again ,
[685/1000]	" i 'll have that bottle . " he reached for it , but she snatched it out of his hand . " oh jesus , look at that bottle , " she said , a little louder
[686/1000]	it was the first time in a long while that she had made them . he was surprised when he saw a flicker of uncertainty in her bright eyes , but she was determined to appear more like the more
[687/1000]	" no other job gives you enough money to live on ? " i could hear the tone in his voice and that was exactly what had occurred when i 'd gotten home from the hospital . " well
[688/1000]	her eyes widened as she stared at him . " i thought you were dead . " yes , but he was n't dead . not yet . he was just in there . her fingers trembled
[689/1000]	' all of this had something to do with the demon who killed your parents , ' she continued in her soothing tone , ' i think he was working with the other demons , perhaps one of them would
[690/1000]	" okay , " i say . " well , sorry to bother you . i 'll let you go now . if you do n't want to run me into the ground , you should get the hell out
[691/1000]	" does n't it bother you ? " " well , no , i guess not . " " how is that different against the rest of us at school ? " " because it 's normal
[692/1000]	he shook his head . " your grandmother thought he 'd be here at eight , so he came over at eleven to meet you . our grandmother thought he 'd work it all out beforehand . " "
[693/1000]	it was just enough money to help out three others as they got up and headed off to school . you either brought a lot of money or you did n't - and he had no doubt that if his

[695/1000]	mike just sat there for a minute . the next thing he knew , he had a woman in his house and he did n't know how to act . " what ? " he asked . " i
[696/1000]	" no . not yet . " he kisses me hard , and the intensity of his words can never be contained , no matter how hard i try . " not yet . " he pulls back only enough
[697/1000]	" i might have been trying to make a point , but i did try to make a point . " she shrugs . it seems she understands now . " i 'm only trying to understand some things ,
[698/1000]	" no , thank you , " i say , my voice flat . and i turn to go , but my arm slips out of his grip and i lose . his grip tightens . " wait !
[699/1000]	by the time they finished , david and samuel were both exhausted and shaking . with the sun sinking toward the horizon , a tall fog bank stretched back into the distance , and they were left with only the
[700/1000]	she nodded . " yes , you really do seem like you got hurt pretty badly . if you 're not careful , the vampire who shot you is going to get angry . " the words would have
[701/1000]	he lowered the gun . " i do n't think the girl is an addict . i believe she was abused as a child . the authorities are making her understand that violence and violence are necessary for her survival
[702/1000]	" i never could , " he said simply . " can you make any sense of it , because it 's all wrong . tell me . " " i just ca n't , that 's all
[703/1000]	' then maybe i would have been better than what i am , ' he laughed , suddenly seeming very content as the group continued to eat and converse . eventually , however , the conversation turned to more
[704/1000]	he shook his head , then pushed his arms through the pockets of his suit jacket . " i guess my life changed in the twenty - first century . i had to do what felt right , in the
[705/1000]	he 'd meant something more than that . it was just time for him to hear what it was she said next . " thank you for being so honest about it . i mean , i know you
[706/1000]	" good . " she looked up at him and mouthed , " thank you , " which he ignored , returning his mouth to her throat . " let 's go outside . " " but it
[707/1000]	" as long as he believes it , they will allow me to leave . i expect to return at the end of the week with the document . " " fine . " she turned away . as
[708/1000]	" i had no idea you were that close to dying . that 's pretty creepy . " ethan chuckled . " do you have any idea how hard it was for me to even think about you after
[709/1000]	at least we were about halfway through the plan . we were all ready to start again as soon as possible , though , which meant no weapons , none of us were planning anything out . i 'm glad
[710/1000]	i feel like a whore of the worst kind . no wonder this place was my home . i am a whore ! her name was jennifer . the last time we went this way she was still
[711/1000]	" yes . " " and had the lady of the house consented to the marriage ? " " no . but , no . your young husband 's honor was not the only thing i would die
[712/1000]	" what makes you think i do n't ? " the expression on his face was that of someone who had his mind set on something as mundane as a five - year - old throwing a base bal
[713/1000]	for some reason , his anger had grown . and now the tension only grew . " it is not fair , " he whispered . " tell me , dr. gray . were you the first scientist
[714/1000]	" how are you so sure he has n't got anything else ? " i asked . " since he 's working hard to pay attention to you and your book . " " well , that , or
[715/1000]	" what are you talking about ? what has happened to her ? why 's she disappearing into thin air ? " " i ca n't describe it . i 'd prefer not to , " he said ,
[716/1000]	i said , " you have a good life , " and i hung up . i put the phone to my ear again . " hello ? " " jim , hi . it 's jim
[717/1000]	" oh , in that case , " i said , my voice suddenly high and unnatural - sounding . " i 'm sorry i got carried away . i 'm scared out of my mind and unable to think
[718/1000]	" do not interfere or i will snap your neck , " i said with a growl , holding his gaze . " tell me where they are or i will kill you . " " why i ca
[719/1000]	i had n't even figured out exactly when , but now she kept looking up to the sky , almost like she was hoping not to see anything . " what 's going on ? " i asked ,
[720/1000]	and we all laugh , like we are all crazy when we do not in fact laugh . at this point , we get into car numbers , and the driver ( who is also not my passenger ,
[721/1000]	there was enough room for a full tank of water and two tanks to serve as water bottles . she 'd decided to bathe while she waited for jeremy . she hated swimming , but the warm water of
[722/1000]	" i 'm fine . it 's no big deal . you made your point . " he laughed coldly . " it will be a big deal when you realize i 'm right . " he walked past
[723/1000]	" my father told me to warn you of the future . this is something that you need to see . " she turned her head toward me , just a fraction of a second too long . we
[724/1000]	and then he stared straight ahead , which is why she never knew what he was thinking . she 'd been trying to forget being used under his father 's roof , trying to forget how many men were
[725/1000]	" we got the same man he is , " the woman said . " maybe , " the man said . " or maybe there 's some other pattern and this guy is following us . "
[726/1000]	i would not give him our house and money ; he was too hard to convince , but i would not deny him . we could speak of family , their existence , and their futures all in the same
[727/1000]	my eyes are big , and i do n't really understand what i 'm seeing or feeling anymore . i know it 's him - the lean , rough - toned man who saved my life , who was there
[728/1000]	" one of my women ? the pregnant one ? that 's what this is all about anyway ; if you get her pregnant , you can never be a husband again . i ca n't keep her . we
[729/1000]	" then he must be in new york . " she lifted a brow . " unless , of course , he 's living here with me . " " doubtful , " tom murmured . " there 's

[731/1000]	" you 're insane , " he shot back . and then , lowering his voice , he started speaking rapidly . " listen , i am not some piece of shit who takes a lot of cash and does
[732/1000]	" there 'll still be a lot of people to meet when <EOS> here , when they get food food . and i do n't know what its dad in bed , or how good it looks . why would
[733/1000]	it 's his turn now . he reaches into his back pocket , brings out a white silk handkerchief and kneels . he wipes his palms on the cloth , wipes his arms and backs up some more .
[734/1000]	" i had no option . there were n't any other way around it . " his arm was around her shoulders , and his hand rested on her hip , the way they always did . " yeah
[735/1000]	" i have no clue . " " me neither , but there 's one more . " he put a hand aside mine and lifted it without looking at me . i watched as the fire crept up
[736/1000]	but it 'll be fine . he 'll be back next year . or at least i hope it will be . i get up and check my phone . there 's one missed call from my mother .
[737/1000]	" i know you did . " " you do n't even know him , but he 's a good man . even if he 's a killer . i know he is . he is your family and
[738/1000]	" are you going to see mom ? " i nodded and slid off the blanket to walk outside . it was n't the light but i was too cold to stop shivering . ethan followed . "
[739/1000]	her eyes had seen a reflection of her , and they grew round with astonishment . and she turned to look at it , as in the reflection of a mirror , as if waiting for it to happen ,
[740/1000]	sam picked up his backpack , wondering what he should say to mr. aw ph el . " tell you what , " mr. aw ph el said . " make yourselves comfortable at home . i 'm going
[741/1000]	" really ? " " i guess you 'd better be ready to run , right ? you ai n't got no life without me in it ! " " i 've got plenty of your life to
[742/1000]	" here , take the water . " he was still saying it , but when we reached the spot where the water had risen the only splash was a very faint , faint sound . " what ?
[743/1000]	he nodded to the table . " eat . " she did so looking down at his hand , then up at his face , then to the food before her at the table , her fear of sharing
[744/1000]	" the man took them when it happened . " " why ? " " he told me i could n't live my life the way he wanted me to live it . but he asked some questions
[745/1000]	" you 're not serious . " " of course i am . i 'm serious , lily . that means you have to promise me you 'll keep your feelings at bay . if you keep giving me
[746/1000]	chapter thirty - one - the end nick " the world is going to end if we stay here . you 're insane , " nick muttered . " think back to when you were a kid and
[747/1000]	she had the same fear he had , but not so much even he could go so far as to dismiss it . he 'd felt it creeping up on him too often from time to time , that feeling
[748/1000]	when you 're fighting , you find a way to let go . there is an endless array of emotions in my mind , but they 're all focused off me , as if i 'm trying to run .

[756/1000]	" i called you early last night , " she says , taking a sip of her coffee . " you did ? " " i was at work , and ryan called before i got home .

[781/1000]	" yes , " she whispered . his palms scraped over her ass . she cried out in relief when he began to spank her ass . her cl * t was red where he hit it , and
[782/1000]	she held her gaze at me and then took my hand again . " you will all have your happy , happy , healthy thoughts tonight . because , even if we have it bad , it comes with a

[799/1000]	" you could try that for me though , " he said . " and i might have had to work for it a bit , but maybe i should call you . " he handed me his card
[800/1000]	" i am . " he did a double take and pressed a button , sending the wall across the room plummeting to the floor . he reached inside the cell . no body . he

[802/1000]	" do n't push it , " said ripred . " we do n't have time for me to pass out . " " but i do n't think we have time , " said gregor . " but
[803/1000]	i let my head hang and stared into the fire . my mind drifted back through my memories : my dad helping jason with the piano , sitting with me as he talked , and the first day i had
[804/1000]	" do n't touch me ! " she said , holding her own personal shield up and staring at it . she felt ashamed of what she was doing , and did that self - conscious shuffle in front
[805/1000]	" i miss him sometimes . " " yes , i know what it 's like to fall in love . " he sighed . " i missed him too . i did n't know how much and
[806/1000]	i turned around . i know . the image of their bodies . i do n't think i want to paint them really that gruesome . " here 's the thing , a lot of them actually died

[808/1000]	although the fire and the smoke made the room seem much smaller , it did not make the room seem any smaller . the only furniture in the room was a wooden rocking chair that had been left behind .
[809/1000]	" i know , " danny said in a thick , unhappy voice so filled with pain that her throat felt nearly impassable . " i hope he 's all right . i hope he 's been well . "
[810/1000]	all i 'm saying is that you do n't want to go down that route . in fact , you know she does n't want to take you at all . it was her idea to start in the first
[811/1000]	she stared at him , eyes wide as a deer caught in headlights . " stop the car . " a muscle jerked in his cheek . " you do n't want to push it now , do you
[812/1000]	" i see , well , i want to tell you something . they left us with enough money while they went back to vegas to bring back our luggage . " his mother 's eyebrows knitted together in
[813/1000]	" is it really that ? " i asked , confused . " is what really ? " he shrugged and began to drive . " you could 've helped me out . i mean that was n't
[814/1000]	" how could you not be angry when your daughter is dead ? " i ask , as i watch her hand fall away from him . he 's breathing hard , sweating visibly . " i was angry
[815/1000]	" i guess so , " i said , but <EOS> did n't doubt her , did n't let herself doubt . i 'd only been down through a handful of the dark corridors of the island . by now
[816/1000]	" do n't you trust me , " peter asked . " no , " alice said . peter knew it was so . john had been too easy to get in as an undercover agent to feel
[817/1000]	" yes ! yes , it 's fine . " he closed his eyes and tilted his head back . then i heard his voice . " say it two more times . " " i - i
[818/1000]	" who 's going to blame it all on us ? " he said . " me , " she said , touching my arm . i felt my skin suddenly hot . she gave me the evil eye
[819/1000]	" so when did you first know there were some humans ? " asks dad . " it was when they were first humans . not long after i felt me . " her shoulders rise as she speaks
[820/1000]	you and the others would have it so much worse then , she thought bitterly . you would all be dead . a sudden heavy weight hit her . there was darkness within her eyes just before darkness stole
[821/1000]	" please tell me it was n't a bad time . " her mother brushed her hair back . " i did n't get home until midnight . " " i know . it 's where i lived
[822/1000]	" was that my name again ? " she asked . " that 's not your name , " i said . " it 's my name . " " okay , yes , that 's my name
[823/1000]	' oh . ' ' thank heavens ! ' ' and now , to celebrate ! ' shouted mr nicholls , opening up his palm and throwing a card . ' please , dear , let me tell
[824/1000]	" you love - " i broke off because nothing about what he said made sense . i was confused enough in my life as it was without any more mistakes . " love what ? " "
[825/1000]	" yes . " he smiled . " but what about you ? what do you think of the way she treats you ? " " it 's all right . " i shifted next to him to ease
[826/1000]	" i did n't do anything . i swear ! " she said , pleading . " alright ! just shut up ! " i said . we stopped and headed for the exit of the park .
[827/1000]	the woman looked at alex , her expression apologetic ; it was as if a part of her had already left . she walked stiffly out of the hall , slamming the door behind her . alex , feeling too

[831/1000]	" now , we both know it is a vampire . so , do n't you even think of trying . " she did n't wait for my response , just stomped off toward the entrance , ignoring my words
[832/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " asked jack . " i do n't know no jacky ! " " yes , you do , " replied his uncle . he rubbed his unshaven chin as he looked
[833/1000]	" it was n't his face . " " and it was n't his eyes , " said bonnett . " they were -- " " he saw out of the corner of his eye all the
[834/1000]	" if i tell you for instance that you 've saved that girl 's life ? would you really believe that ? just think about it , " he offered . " from what i 've heard you 've done
[835/1000]	" no ! you 're just being dramatic . " he turns to me . " that would n't be something you would say to an enemy . " " i would n't say anything . " i smile

[841/1000]	" i understand , " i mumbled . a few minutes later , we were on the same flight going back to la . when we finally reached the house next to the palm trees , i noticed i
[842/1000]	i want to rip out his heart just to get back at him . i grab his shirt and yank him to me . i am willing to do anything then , just so his face gets in all
[843/1000]	" okay , all of you . let 's go . " caleb walks to the door , opening it to reveal a massive group of guardians . " we need to get back to work right now . you
[844/1000]	" yeah ? you hear that , chris ? " she looked at me , a puzzled look upon her face as she continued to listen . " who 's saying to your mom no , daddy ?
[845/1000]	" so , " said nevi . " back when it was real , the clans wanted to join and play with the other clans , but they knew they 'd all have to deal with me . i hate

[850/1000]	" ah . " " so , you still have one shot . " " yes dear . i know it 's far . i 'll just be waiting for one of my officers to leave it there
[851/1000]	he paused ... and then said , " all right , well , if you need anything - " " no , no . the thing can wait . " she pointed at the phone . " what are
[852/1000]	" no , i want to hear you ask your questions . " " so , who are these people , exactly ? " " for starters , they took a look at what they saw up there
[853/1000]	" that 's my family , " the vampire snapped back , " not yours . " this was really the first vamp they 'd encountered . the one they 'd heard arguing about his job . the
[854/1000]	" yes , sir , " i said . i was thinking that would be a shame to lose my job on such short notice , but his offer sounded appealing . " i wish to apply for a job
[855/1000]	the three of them went in search of jake . he 'd learned a lot during growing up that morning . he 'd been training hard . every cell in his body screamed at him to keep moving ,
[856/1000]	his eyes widened in fear at the words . he looked like she 'd hit him . what was wrong with her ? she 'd been around people since birth . they 'd taken her from the shelter .
[857/1000]	" i 'm not sure . " " you 're right . " " for me . " " you know that ca n't be true . but you 're both trying to tell me you 're
[858/1000]	i did n't seem to hear any more . again , her response was to sigh happily . " yes ! " i was still walking . " have you been here before ? " " not since
[859/1000]	" i 'm not tired , " he said . " come here . " he set his rifle on the floor next to a wall as he walked toward her . she ran her hand over his thigh
[860/1000]	he nodded slowly . " yeah . of course . " i waited for him to get off the phone . he looked up at me , and a little bit of amusement flickered in his eyes , but
[861/1000]	this was too easy . he had n't even asked whether she was still alive , or was she dead . that he would risk that would n't seem nearly as important as seeing her . he knew she
[862/1000]	he stopped for a moment at the foot of the stairs . what did i do with that ? " thanks , " i said . " i 'm happy to help . you go ahead , but remember ,
[863/1000]	" if i knew it made you uncomfortable it sure would n't have been enough for me , " he said , not really meaning it . but anna laughed . " now excuse me , you have to

[867/1000]	she swallowed . " what was that ? " " you said just two words . you said i was hot for you . " he watched her face carefully , sure she would deny it . " do
[868/1000]	" i want you to . " " why ? " " it is my turn to taste you . " he pressed another kiss to her lips . " i will not let it go for an
[869/1000]	" what if i do ? " i asked . i figured he might think i did this out of spite , although i 'd never done such a thing before . " i 'm sure you would .
[870/1000]	" so we 're not just going to stand here and wait for him to come back ? " anna asked . " that 's what i 'm talking about , anna . we have to move . "
[871/1000]	" do n't worry , " dad said , " she will protect you . she 's the best student i know . she 'll go through hard times alone . trust me . " " because you do
[872/1000]	" but it is n't a proper marriage ! " " that is not my duty , " laurence said . " you have no duty at all , " temeraire said lof tily , " except to
[873/1000]	" yeah , " i say . i walk over to my desk , sit down on my ass , and pull my sketch pad back out of my drawer . i ca n't spend the rest of the
[874/1000]	" why would you do that ? " " i wanted to . " my eyes dart to his face once again before returning to mine . his tongue darts out to toy with the corner of his mouth
[875/1000]	an elevator creaked to life nearby and pulled up to our floor . " good morning , " another woman said , waving cheerfully from the elevator , her long dark hair in a perfect french twist next to
[876/1000]	" you and my husband are in very deep shit , " i promised . " and that 's what makes your last fifteen years so ... crazy . " he laughed and muttered , " jesus , i
[877/1000]	" he 's already in the room , waiting for me . " " no , " i say quickly , but he laughs instead of commenting , " okay , just put him in the shower . you
[878/1000]	" hey , i ca n't make it down here . there 's a ton of people waiting up to give their congratulations . " " what 's that noise ? " she asked , smiling weakly .
[879/1000]	but something made me curious about the other guy . ' you should n't be here , ' i said to the man with the pale skin . he looked about fifteen , maybe younger . he frowned and turned
[880/1000]	" i 'm not doing this with some ass * * le . i do n't care if he lives in tennessee or on the other side of the globe . " i was n't going to let her call
[881/1000]	she nodded but stopped when she saw zane pacing the carpet in front of his computer . his gaze was fixed on her but he would n't turn away . he was n't the same man she 'd fallen for
[882/1000]	she raised her head up . the moon shining on her face shone through the thick darkness at the far end of the lake . how far did she really need to go in order to reach her home ?
[883/1000]	" you 're such a smart - ass . " they walked back to the office and sat down on the leather sofas . they drank coffee and went over the list of questions . " so what
[884/1000]	he smiles and rolls his hips . " not for a long time , maybe . " he pulls back to give me a hard look before he rolls out of bed , and i sit there with my legs
[885/1000]	" how long have you two been together ? " he asked . she was quick to respond . " fourteen - and - a - half years . but we work quite a bit together . "
[886/1000]	" was it awful ? " she asked . now he was the one smiling . " not bad . " " are they gon na tell you what you did , or what happened to me ,
[887/1000]	' well , yes , maybe , ' said the coach . ' but anyway , they 'll tell me i have to go up against someone from my own village , and ask me how long it will take
[888/1000]	" no . " " you need to feel yourself . " then i take it and run my palm up and down her slit . " so wet , bella , " i murmur against her
[889/1000]	' with a bit of luck , ' she warned . ' and what if he wins ? ' he challenged . ' then i 'll come and pay him , ' the voice on the other end
[890/1000]	they were all now in a dimly lit room lined with small cots , each with light bulb fixtures on the ceiling . there was a small open doorway to their right , which led out a small balcony that

[892/1000]	" it 's a nice dream , " she said . he made some more toast , which was good , and some sandwiches too , and when he finished , he was ready to jump in the water
[893/1000]	the doctor cleared his throat , " then how do i get back ? " " you 're on a road trip . " the doctor squinted , " the bus . " " to the bus
[894/1000]	it was only when he was on the next swing that he looked up . not at the tall , dark boy standing in the doorway , but directly across from him . he was n't just that hot
[895/1000]	" there 's no reason , " he explained , " that i would do this . " i tried to sound serious . " then why did you bother when i first came here ? " he
[896/1000]	" you see how easily that makes you feel ? " he smiled evilly at her . " she did n't call me after all . she called you . " hannah stood up . " you 're right
[897/1000]	he was right . this is not your father , someone whispered . it is n't . " but he was , " he insisted , more harshly than i would have . " he was a terrible ,

[910/1000]	" that 's right , ma'am . would you mind telling me where you 're traveling from ? " " charleston , virginia . " " oh ? " " the man in the car with me
[911/1000]	" me , too , " i said , giving her one last kiss , " but ... i have to make the call . " i looked up into her eyes and she nodded in her head .
[912/1000]	" yeah , look , do n't say anything . " i tried not to sound mad . " i did n't . i guess it 's just a little awkward the way so many people have been staring
[913/1000]	" well ? " she asked , raising an eyebrow . " they say that with time they 'll grow into men just like you , when i go to war . " he could tell by her expression
[914/1000]	" why are you giving me a speech ? " it was pointless to argue , if she did n't come up with an adequate answer soon . if she ever did , she 'd end up saying something
[915/1000]	" it is , " he agreed , the line still moving now . that last step was a long one , but it worked . the truck slid to the side , but she did n't feel him
[916/1000]	" i think i 'll be joining , " said k lei to . without commenting , she disappeared back into the cavern . " who 's that woman ? " breslin asked . " who ?

[920/1000]	i put my foot in the center of the hole and placed both hands around the edge to keep myself from falling . she shook my hand hard . my mind raced back to last night . the feel ...
[921/1000]	but he found her as eager as he was , she was so beautiful . too beautiful . and the very thought that was killing them both and keeping them on a short flight back to rome left him shaken
[922/1000]	" when the time comes i 'll buy you gifts . but not now . i want to meet and greet you . " " i really do n't want in your bed , daniel . i ca n't

[924/1000]	" if you 're just going to do it for fun , you 'll have to do it for my benefit . just to be thorough . " " i will do my best not to be a disappointment

[929/1000]	she smiled . " now , now - you 're nothing like the men who came to help me at the hospital . " the men who came to help her ? " who were they ? "
[930/1000]	" and ? " " well , i do n't remember how much money he made , or how much he did n't . " the other man put down his spoon and poured himself some coffee . he
[931/1000]	" i just - i do n't know if i can ? " he is so strong , so sure of himself , and it just makes me cry harder . he hugs me . " just for tonight

[938/1000]	" this will only take a minute , " said the man , reaching in his side pocket and taking out a couple of small brown envelopes . he held one out to the boy . " do you have
[939/1000]	" yes , i believe so , " he replied . " and yet i always felt that i should know what i wanted , because it was from you . but i realize i was only a fool and

[944/1000]	" are you in pain ? " my lips curl . " not at the moment . " he 's silent , considering me . " then who am i ? " i clear my throat .
[945/1000]	we walk around the side of the house and head up the back stairs . calder and i reach the front door of the building . the lock and the side door are locked . we 've used my key
[946/1000]	but it was still no sleep that consoled him . it was , after all , his wife 's funeral . in his mind 's eye , he saw her . he could still hear , even now :
[947/1000]	" only a hint . " she held up her hand . " do n't tell anyone . you know i 'd have the cops take him back to the hospital . " " and how are you going
[948/1000]	then she felt a hand brush her face . " baby , you wake up . " she shifted and when her eyes opened she saw prentice looming over her , his arm still wrapped around her ,
[949/1000]	" yes . " " what are you getting at , sir ? " " she said my car , and mine ; and she said that i was supposed to think she was with me . so
[950/1000]	i 'm thinking you should get in bed . look , there 's no way in hell that i 'm letting you use that as a weapon . " the kid was n't even sure he 'd heard him correctly
[951/1000]	i stared down . and took in the words written on the front , starting with two lines : i love you , jacob . and he loved me . after reading that , i thought
[952/1000]	the next day i arrived at the market a little after seven . the air was still brisk and i had a thick coat of sweat on and i could feel the temperature rise in the air through my sweat
[953/1000]	" no , " said a voice behind him . " you 're better off not finding the way to the tunnel . " peter spun around . but the thing in front of him was still motionless ,
[954/1000]	" or a simple matter of money . do n't worry . this is a business transaction , not the money . " he turns towards the wall and takes out a key . " i need the key for
[955/1000]	" just for the record , i do n't need a job , " he said through clenched teeth , then added , " as long as you keep paying what you 're paid to pay me , it 's
[956/1000]	my eyes darted from the line in front of me to the wall at the front . i heard the pop and the rustle of plastic as we separated . the walls began to change , falling away , exposing
[957/1000]	the man 's words rang around the courtroom like a bell that rang hollow . " ... the defendant 's conviction was accidental , " he droned . " you will speak now , counselor . " he
[958/1000]	he had to work on it , he told himself . it was not a good thing to build a little trust where there was nowhere to go . it was a good thing to make friends and go out
[959/1000]	she was very pleased and her voice was so soft . " that 's not what it - " then she got quiet again , so quiet , it sounded like music . he lifted his hand , palm
[960/1000]	she moved her gaze from her daughter 's face to watch the people around her , laughing , talking . everyone looked so happy , so carefree . she wondered what she was going to do now . a
[961/1000]	" yes , " he agreed with a wicked smile . " her father is an even stronger protector than me . a warrior at heart . his only regret is that she died a coward . " "
[962/1000]	" he 'll be here in a few minutes , darling . what about something to eat then ? " " maybe we can find something interesting to do away from prying eyes . " she picked up her
[963/1000]	" that 's a rather apt thing to say about your own heart . i always heard you were determined to have an affair with your husband . " " is this the part where i get an unfair
[964/1000]	" do i know you ? " an unfamiliar voice inquired . i turned to see an attractive young man , about my age , standing behind the bench . he was an absolute stun ner - tall ,
[965/1000]	" let me take you , " he murmured . " come along , love . it 'll be fun . " her answer was a sharp retort and she was quickly led from the room with damien dragging
[966/1000]	" sure , i 'm sure , " i said before i slipped away . chapter twelve i arrived back at my old place after one late night party and went straight into the office . i was
[967/1000]	he stared at me , a flash of something like amusement sliding over his face . " he 's perfect . " i blushed red . " you 're just saying that because you think the rest of us
[968/1000]	" get out ! " i yelled . " just leave us alone ! " i screamed . her answer was a low - pitched hissing noise that sounded to me like the cat that had taken wing .
[969/1000]	" what could he want with me ? " said jason . " i 'm looking for a gold piece , not a dead bag of bones . right ? " " well , you wo n't find it
[970/1000]	" no . " i push the tip of my tongue into the small knot of hair at the back of her head , my teeth biting into her ear , my lips brushing my jaw , as i kiss
[971/1000]	" who 'd want us to hang around ? but i 'll have to check that girl out . " dad cleared his throat and motioned toward me . " here , let me put these in your hair .
[972/1000]	there were others , and he saw that they were all women , including a man : a small man with long hair and the same dark eyes as chlorien ; he recognised the one beside him who looked almost
[973/1000]	" what does it look like ? " he asked . " it 's a mirror of my memories . see how each one is so different , so all the pieces are made of a crystal ? it 's
[974/1000]	you seem to be doing a great job of staying away from him ; something you should know with his reputation . do n't get me wrong , we did have words a few times after the incident . he
[975/1000]	" but she 's so ... " " quiet , " the lady said , pulling on her necklace . " i will take care of her . " " i see you saved me , " he
[976/1000]	" we 're going to a concert outside the city tonight , " she announces as she heads up the stairs . " you 're going to a concert in our city ? really ? " i 'm curious

[978/1000]	" it 's not the first time . and i 'm pretty pissed at mom for keeping it a secret with me all this time . if anyone gives a damn about some dirty little secret , it 's him
[979/1000]	she raised her head . " you do n't just ask me that ? " " no , i do n't think i do . " " well , yes . " she tried to remember what it
[980/1000]	when the doors were sealed against her from both sides , her body shook with barely suppressed tears . " when i see you again , i 'm going to kill you , and i swear i will love it
[981/1000]	" the only way i could afford it , was if i had a good - sized portion of the income from the bar at the diner . but i do n't remember a bill getting signed . " i
[982/1000]	" that 's fine , " my voice croa ks as i stand and walk toward her . " when 's your appointment tomorrow ? " before she can answer , a second man walks through the door behind
[983/1000]	" one of them said something about the other . " " what ? " " it was at the entrance . the one who was here before . " " tell me . " "
[984/1000]	" i - i do n't really feel that way . " " why not ? " he questioned just as quickly . " because of peter . " " tell me about peter . "
[985/1000]	her eyes went wide and she stared at him . " you 're kidding , right ? " " nope . " " but ... i'm thinking that this date ... " " ... is not going
[986/1000]	he felt sick . what else could be going on ? the last few weeks , it had been horrible , like a nightmare , but now he was getting a back rub . he suddenly remembered what he
[987/1000]	but ... i could n't . and i 'd walked away from him . i 'd gotten tired of his touching me , and yet i 'd come back . i could n't be so heartless in my heart
[988/1000]	she did n't like those thoughts . " i wanted to see how far he 'd take it . how far he would do it . he did n't have many other options , but he knew he had
[989/1000]	" do n't get me wrong , <EOS> right , " she laughs . " i think it depends on who you met , because ... or is it because you have n't been with anyone ? and we 've

[994/1000]	or is it real ? is it out there ? i wish i had more time to worry . i wish i did n't have to deal with this . the pain in my chest is like a fist
[995/1000]	his blood ran cold when she told him she planned on making an attempt to get in the game with him - the same game whitney had used . " you 're not killing anyone , dahlia . lily
[996/1000]	' sorry , mr grey , but i could n't let you sit in there . all you need is a drink from the local tap and time to work through your problems . ' the constable smiled a smile
[997/1000]	" thank heaven he was , but i guess if he ever caught me going every other afternoon that he 'd be pissed . " " what happened ? " " that 's none of your business .
