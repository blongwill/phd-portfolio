[21/1000]	he did n't question it . " yes , actually it was my mom with her " they drove the rest of the way in a much more sedate manner than the last time he was here .

[24/1000]	<EOS> i was a very quick , very graceful young girl . but i had n't had anything to drink since saturday morning , not an ounce of caffeine . my limbs were as stiff as i had been when

[26/1000]	" so what are you saying , mr. powers ? " " i am going to make him a blood - sucking , de gener ative ghoul . one that can keep you all on your toes . "
[27/1000]	she did n't feel like doing that to anyone else . especially a stranger . " we have news , " hector said as he eased down beside her . " have you spent much time with the perp

[39/1000]	then something strange happened . i felt a tiny presence . it was a memory , a distant memory , but a memory i soon understood . " david ? " " yep , " he replied ,
[40/1000]	" you 're very strong , " " it 's good , too , to keep moving inside you . you keep moving , and you 'll make me bigger . " " very well , i 'll

[48/1000]	she 'd thought such fantasies were fantasy , but she knew better . she 'd wanted him , physically and emotionally . it had taken her time to get past the fear and the pain and to believe that he

[50/1000]	" maybe i am a little on edge . " even with the glasses on i could n't see into his eyes . " no i 'm not . " he took my hand , lifting it and studying
[51/1000]	" go lie down , " he ordered , and i rose from the recliner . " why do n't you take a shower ? i 'll help you get some water off . " i was n't ready
[52/1000]	" i 'm guessing it 's the same day that you were in the middle of it , and you were in a park . " " the park 's the one with the trees surrounding mine . "
[53/1000]	" how do you feel ? " " i really would be up , but i think it would be easier if you did n't touch me . " " sorry . i did n't mean it that

[58/1000]	they would make a good team . they had to . there were no words to describe the closeness between them in the moments that it took for him to pull his own hand away . he was just shaking
[59/1000]	but what if the people were here to kill him anyway ? a shudder washed over him and he pulled his hands from his pockets to rub them together dry , trying to generate energy , hoping that his palms
[60/1000]	" why might that be , my lord ? " it took garion an instant to realize that these words of the rivan warder were not merely rhetorical conversation and that , quite deliberately , gre l dik was
[61/1000]	not quite so sure . what if it 's a ghost ? ' rincewind hurried off across the plain . he was aware of a man with a large moustache who was looking through some trees when he arrived
[62/1000]	" good luck , " she said , giving him a hug and letting go after she finished showering . as she stepped out , she saw the rest of the family waiting outside . her parents were both
[63/1000]	' can i keep it ? ' ' yes . ' she pulled it out , set it on a desk with its glass legs . she looked at mr sa vel oy , who must have been
[64/1000]	we ran together toward the small clearing where we 'd met up with them . we entered and sat opposite matt and his people . he smiled over at me as we sat . " thanks for the ride ,
[65/1000]	and then i knew . he was n't like jacob . this was never a bad thing . with jacob , it never was . with his family , it was the smartest , best thing to do
[66/1000]	" ah . " his eyes flared . he cleared his throat when he looked at me . " i have something i want to show to you . " " show you where ? " " the
[67/1000]	" sure , he was the reason you did n't finish college . but i think he would've been mad too - i 've grown tired of people telling me to slow down . at least i did n't have
[68/1000]	she was n't sure how to respond . what do you expect from a person who 's been raped and imprisoned . she was so horrified , she could n't speak and could hardly draw air to speak .
[69/1000]	" thank you for staying in this morning . it feels truly weird having this done to me . " " it was n't so bad . " " have a nice day . " the evening
[70/1000]	' so , what did you discover ? ' he turned his attention further upwards into the vast ceiling . ' about a year ago i found a small black book , as long as 1 , 000 pages
[71/1000]	" at least we know it was safe , " mike muttered as he pulled his cell phone out of his back pocket and dialed 9 - 1 - 1 . before he could speak , the police scanner
[72/1000]	" what ? " he responded . " what did you do for that woman , joe ? you do n't even know . " he laughed . " when will i know ? " " when
[73/1000]	" you 're just too crazy , " i muttered , and moved away quickly . the closer i got to him , the warmer he got , and when his hands touched my waist , i jumped . then
[74/1000]	" you 're the best , " i said . " i know that already . " my thumb moved over his lips . " that <EOS> just proves that ... you still kiss me . we 'd be fine
[75/1000]	he could only hope that with a couple of days on her hands , her sisters would be ready to break the news to her . of course , they might not know yet , but the last thing they
[76/1000]	" you do ? " " if you do n't want me to , you should n't . you should have said it to me first . " now she remembered two days ago . after that ,
[77/1000]	" i was making sure you were comfortable , " he says , sliding her hair behind her ears . " i 'll be there in a minute . " i make sure my face is hidden when he
[78/1000]	a low rumbling of thunder echoed down the valley . it was n't like the rumbling she 'd heard previously , now she could clearly hear a steady rumble . the same sort as she 'd heard a moment earlier
[79/1000]	" where is it ? " the policeman was about to ask his questions like a smart investigator , so reuben pointed to a black car coming away from the barn . before anyone could protest , the car
[80/1000]	" it just goes to show . you ca n't buy things as easy as you can make money , " peter told him . " he is just trying to say that with all that money i ca
[81/1000]	" do you think we would have made it if you had n't given us the go ahead ? " " do you trust me , samantha ? " he asked her . why do i even ask
[82/1000]	" what ? you want me to suck you while you sleep ? " she giggled . " would n't you love that ? " i knew it was stupid , but only because i did n't want
[83/1000]	" good point . what about the people who saved him ? " " ah , and how are we supposed to know who he is ? " " anyone got a name before him ? "
[84/1000]	" why does it seem odd that i do n't even know who you really are , " she said , looking at the older man . " yes , well i 'm not even really sure where you
[85/1000]	three and a half hours later , they 'd cleaned up the mess . they got in the truck and drove off to do another job - another job they should have done two hours ago . this time they
[86/1000]	" the first time i ever tasted you was two years ago , honey , " she said . " when ? " " one of the big nights of your life , before i became a little

[89/1000]	" what <EOS> " " they 're not working on anything , " i said . " maybe they ca n't keep this one from them , especially a single word for a man in the shadows . "

[92/1000]	" there was fear in the one whose name you gave the one who seemed willing to become so violent . he was a young child , innocent of the punishment of our master , the dark lord , whose
[93/1000]	" you love him , or he loves you ? " " i do n't know , " i answered bluntly . " what if you broke off the engagement ? what if you gave into the desire
[94/1000]	he threw back his head , feeling powerful , almost invincible . " and if i am true to my oath , if i am truly the chosen <EOS> ... you will return home , and with you the most
[95/1000]	' ok , back to the question . what else happened . ' ' well , i was n't told what to expect . we were n't shown any guards . i mean we had no weapons or anything
[96/1000]	she dropped to the floor and began to pull him away . " no , cole . it 's not that ! " reaching his hand under the hem of her dress , he gently caressed the satin <EOS>

[98/1000]	i could sense you watching me from somewhere and you were a good distance away , that much i could tell . you only did nothing . like so many times before , when i was under the influence of
[99/1000]	slowly he turned to look at my friend . " you mean she was n't just playing ? she was doing these crazy shots of tequila ? in front of me ? " a look of panic flashed across his
[100/1000]	" will you keep that in mind when you 're in town ? " he nodded as we crossed over toward the front of the house . " whenever i visit the family room and den . "
[101/1000]	" that 's all right . i 'm okay . " and he was . a few minutes ago he had closed his eyes over the idea that he might never see his wife again . but she was here
[102/1000]	i 'm thinking i 'll get along just fine with a bunch of men who just have a lot of money and think the world is a pretty big place . " his grip loosened slightly and he lowered
[103/1000]	you were the one who started the talk in the first place . ' i shook my head , but it felt like the world stopped spinning . ' i 'm sorry , ' he said .

[105/1000]	we were both silent for a while , watching the water go from pale white white to dark red . " i bet they really did a number on you on the inside , " jake said quietly .
[106/1000]	it 's like he 's been born here with me . maybe he is - his hands slide from my shoulders , skimming over my shoulders , up my arms . then he wraps me in his arms ,
[107/1000]	i smiled , " only for now . " at that , he kissed me again . " i love you , bella . " he spoke the words like a benedic tion and they penetrated into
[108/1000]	" wait , your uncle and i are already on our way , " nate said . " great , i 'm happy to have him back , " amy replied . " get on with bringing the rest
[109/1000]	one of them , the blue - eyed kid , the younger one , said , " now you 're sounding like my dad . " " well , the kid 's right , " said the kid who

[122/1000]	" and so why did you want to be with him ? look at him , you do n't think you could . you ca n't stand the attention , the sight of him , like a lot of guys
[123/1000]	" you did n't say so , honey , " cal replied and she felt that muscle start ticking in his jaw again . " i had to ask . " " you had to ask ? "
[124/1000]	she felt around the table for something to eat . then she thought better of it , picking up a piece of her croissant out of one of the bags that he 'd discarded earlier . she nibbled it and
[125/1000]	she was glad i took the liberty of finding a couple of pairs of jeans in my size so i would n't have to have them , because she would n't be able to afford them exactly , but the
[126/1000]	" thank you , " i said , getting up . " i 'm glad i could help . oh , and maybe later we 'll have a nice coffee and scones ? " i said , thinking that was

[130/1000]	" if you think that 's going to make me happy , you 're wrong , " she told him . this made him smile , and then he slid up her body and kissed her , devouring her
[131/1000]	his eyes darted right to her , and the blue iris gleamed . he 'd begun to pull away , but he did n't . he did n't believe she 'd actually hurt him . he was determined to force
[132/1000]	so what was the connection ? did he know i even existed ? there might be a moment 's doubt in his mind , maybe even fear , if i could hear his thoughts . did he think he 'd
[133/1000]	" i feel fine , " i reply , holding my hand out to him for his hand . he runs his fingers underneath my fingers , stroking me . " i just got something . " he runs

[142/1000]	what a silly boy . i turned my head so we would n't have to talk . logan leaned farther , until his face was level with mine . he reached out and ran his fingertips down my cheek

[153/1000]	she nods . " yeah . i suppose it is , then we 'd better get busy finding a house . " " i 'm just glad it 's all over . i wish we 'd never met .
[154/1000]	his feet moved swiftly and effortlessly , his reflexes much faster than any human could have managed . she could n't let him get his hands on her , the feeling of their power - it was nearly as heady
[155/1000]	" you got anything else ? " i asked him . he nodded again . i leaned over and kissed him on the forehead . then i stood up , got my rifle , and looked left and right
[156/1000]	it had been a long time since my family had lived together , and now that we were finally getting married , i could n't help but feel nervous . " do n't worry about it , sis .
[157/1000]	" you may run me out of the woods if you think this is what i 'm gon na do , but if you have any serious concerns 'bout whether i turn him over to the cops , do n't
[158/1000]	" what ? " i ask as he walks over . he starts to unbutton his shirt , but i stop him . " you need to be able to look or think or ... just talk ! "
[159/1000]	" why ? since you invited me to stay here in this house , i thought you might like to unpack at sam 's . i 'll just take a shower and be back before lunch , " jake said
[160/1000]	i heard a door slam . " yes ? " " you remember , the day he came to the office , to see mr. buchanan ? " the voice startled me . " yes , i 'd
[161/1000]	" we know who killed her , " i repeat her words , knowing that this monster has what must be considered an impeccable reputation for brutality . most often he is a quiet , un demanding member of society
[162/1000]	" when do , then ? " he asked . sam shifted uncomfortably . " in the spring . we 've been to visit you , you know , the old hospital , the hospital with its big swing
[163/1000]	he 's so sweet . he smells good , too . he does n't touch me without looking at me . he always does . i love it when he kisses me , when he puts his warm hands
[164/1000]	" now that was stupid , " i said , grinning . " you should have asked me to move in . " " no , " i said . " you would have been just as bad
[165/1000]	" what 's up ? " " something you should see . " she shifted her dress to better cover her face . he took one of her hands in both of his . " we 've
[166/1000]	the only thing that made me think jack was the person i was meant to go to was my mother . it would n't just be my mother and no - show . there would be dozens of the
[167/1000]	" it 's just the last one . it does n't require much . " he handed her a long , black leather wallet which he was already slipping into his blazer . he then unlocked a piece of glass
[168/1000]	or worse , their home had been cleaned . " they 've been right to worry about it , though . " " and of course the new vampire wo n't bring up our being together here , "
[169/1000]	" i was thinking more the same , " he nodded . a lump formed in my throat . " where 's your door ? " i asked . he flashed me his brilliant smile . " that
[170/1000]	my head was throbbing , and i rubbed it experimentally , taking in a shuddering breath . he was very tall , and very built , with one bulky shoulder . it never paid to cross cross paths with a
[171/1000]	" all right . we 'll go through the house , see what we can find . " she had wanted to get as much out of the apartment as possible before this thing with the vampire happened again .
[172/1000]	" you will also be told this in the spring , unless you are too tired for it , " said the monk , who turned and spoke to a soldier standing nearby . the soldier nodded and smiled ,
[173/1000]	" how ... ? ! " the man stammered , " are you all right ? ! my friend is hurt and you ... you - " the prince could n't bring himself to listen now . he grabbed
[174/1000]	" that 's not a bad idea . " i turn to her . " i want to join the dauntless on their day when they 're doing things like this . " she smiles half - heartedly ,
[175/1000]	" the way i see it , you and your brothers are tied up quite nicely now that they 're legally dead . now that we 've cleared their murders and then the money , this would be the way
[176/1000]	" i used to like you a lot , " she said , surprised and a bit sad too . " i liked your touch when we were kids . we were good friends , so it made sense .
[177/1000]	" it 's not the only thing , " zane said with a sigh . " yeah , " ty agreed in a quiet voice . " it is n't ? " he asked without looking at zane .
[178/1000]	" i do n't care . a - a - a - " i stuttered . i could n't even get the stutter into my head , but only nodded . jared opened the door . " okay .
[179/1000]	tom looked and saw a small opening in the ground beside the barn . it was a hole for someone to climb through if it were necessary . the room was about eight feet wide by eight feet high by
[180/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " have you talked to george about the divorce ? " his blood froze and his thoughts flew out of his head . he stood paralyzed , as only a fool
[181/1000]	twenty - three sam glanced briefly at the clock and knew they must be at the church right now . she was late because she 'd forgotten to change into the summer dress she 'd bought for the
[182/1000]	then , for a while , i sat , until my stomach rumbled noisily , then crawled into the oven . my phone rang as i started it up . james . " hey there , baby girl .
[183/1000]	it was the other way around . he did n't have to ask how " we " got it out of there . somehow it was true . on the other hand , i did n't mind sharing
[184/1000]	" is that why i 'm here ? to hear you talk about my father ? my mother was abusive ? " her eyes were wild . " yes . " she lowered her hands , but rose
[185/1000]	" how about you come back to the office , and we 'll see who has it and who does n't ? " " what about you ? " " what about me ? " he shrugged
[186/1000]	" how many times would i have to turn around a few times ? " " i do n't know . i 'm not into counting like that , except if we 're careful . " " careful
[187/1000]	" in another life , it might have been . " " we 're having my baby , in a time before you age . i do n't understand how that could be . " " i 'd
[188/1000]	" like - where and why , just how ? when did we first - ah , uh , take it together ? the night you told me about our marriage and your history . i never believed it until
[189/1000]	chapter one december 199 3 the two young girls crossed the street and stood in front of the long white victorian mansion that loomed over most of the neighborhood . a slight breeze made a slight rustling sound
[190/1000]	" why , thank you . i wish you the best . " she turned to go inside , and he noticed , with a twinge of jealousy , that she was with another man . he wanted that woman
[191/1000]	" the fact that you 're a friend makes me feel better , " i say . " i 'll take care of it . " i lean toward him and point at the fridge . " now that that
[192/1000]	the house was almost empty . if you are n't family , make sure the baby is with you when you go in . a pair of black boots waited in the foyer . " your sister dropped by
[193/1000]	" they 're my sisters all right . " i lie . my grandmother smacks me in the thigh . " of course they are . what kind of tramp keeps it up ? " " who cares
[194/1000]	instead of heading straight for the bar , she followed his lead . she needed to get away from this . not just back to the city , but from everything she 'd experienced this evening . there was no
[195/1000]	" get back , " i said , pulling him away . " we have to find them before your dad finds them ! " he looked down at the gun . " i saw you pull that .
[196/1000]	" you have that wrong ; it never ends well . " he stepped over me in the sand and kissed his way just beneath my ear . " and when did you let go of that little bitch who
[197/1000]	his gaze fell on the sleeping form , then settled on her profile . the light from the hall lit the curve of her jaw and the elegant line of her neck . there was a slight line against her
[198/1000]	" i am not a god , richard , " richard snapped . " i am not a madman . besides , you know - " he glanced quickly at ilysa . " - that a man does not have
[199/1000]	' i will miss you , ' i said softly . ' i 'll always love you . ' he looked at me as if i was crazy , but did not deny it . ' you have a
[200/1000]	i started to scream . i knew we were going to die . i knew there was no way we would survive , but i did n't know how to fight anymore . nothing mattered but this . this was
[201/1000]	her hand wrapped around the glass door handle . she took a deep breath and forced her feet to move with confidence , feeling the pull of gravity upon her . she stepped out into the dimly evening ,
[202/1000]	" where in the world did your money come from ? " " i paid attention up until the time i heard about your new job . " " you really think i 'm going to take it
[203/1000]	' good idea , ' she said , but when she gave me the signal her tongue looked sharper and sharper . like knives , my hand felt strange . it had never felt cold before in my life
[204/1000]	" this is not our problem , " replied the general . " our men and i may be able to assist the defense of the city if we can find work working on our own . " "
[205/1000]	" no , " she said . " he 's not alive . " " no shit , " nathan muttered . " i 'm guessing you wo n't tell matt . " she started to answer ,
[206/1000]	" it sounds like most of the other times you 've seen him in the past few days , " kelly confessed . " there have been a few bad times when i thought him going off to college for
[207/1000]	" then let 's go . " he threw a handful of coins on the street , and turned for the corner where a crowd had gathered . " here 's what 's going to happen . you 're going
[208/1000]	" come on , come on ! " " no . it 's not . " " what the fuck is it ? " " you 're being a dick , " i said . " do
[209/1000]	" or was it a girl ? " " girls do n't do that , " she said , glancing at me . " i do . that does n't mean i 'm a virgin i can always go
[210/1000]	" is there any way you can come in for a few hours , so i can get some stuff for you before tomorrow ? " " tomorrow ? no , i 'm not going into the store after
[211/1000]	" what do you have to say for yourself ? " he asked . " you 're treating me like i 'm more of a woman than a child . if you 'd stopped acting like a boy and
[212/1000]	' we 'd like to know what happened over there ! ' beesely yelled . ' how did it happen ? ' ' first off , we do n't know where you 're from . secondly , we do
[213/1000]	" i do ? " david shrugged . " just curious . " " about what ? " " when are your things moved into your apartment ? " when you let me think that you
[214/1000]	" no one knows where ... " i said . " for weeks i just thought ... " " ... they would know , " liam finished for me . i shrugged like it was no big deal
[215/1000]	you do ? i do n't get it . " " there has to be another way . " " do n't you think ? " he shrugged . " i 've been doing things like this for
[216/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , katie . so sorry . it 's what happened in the alley . i never meant for any of those people to get hurt . " " did i ? " he
[217/1000]	why was n't his son coming home ? her hands went to her stomach as panic descended over her . she 'd become her father 's second - in - command . their father ... was dead .
[218/1000]	" what am i supposed to do ? get him to marry her ? " she put her finger to her lips and nodded to the wall , in front of the chair . " do you ever sleep ?
[219/1000]	" she is a strong , healthy woman and will keep strong until she has won . one of your most important duties is to ensure that she is safe and secure . i think when the time comes for
[220/1000]	it was a strange thing to think of , and the next thing i knew , i was in his cabin with my legs on the edge of the cot . " that 's so incredibly confusing , "
[221/1000]	he turned away from the window , walked to the bed and lay down on his side . she felt him shiver . she 'd never known a man this way before . his strength filled the room ,
[222/1000]	" my - " i pointed over my shoulder . " he 's gone or something ... " he did n't respond , and i looked back at the wall . my eyes found his silhouette against the
[223/1000]	what 's the use in trying to tell a bunch of people they do n't want people to know about them ? they 'll just think that 's why they 're here . that 's their destiny . to kill
[224/1000]	the little girl waved her hands in front of the mirror , then reached out and pinched a lock of my hair . startled , i pulled out of her grasp . " hey , wait , what was
[225/1000]	at the moment , that was his default position with the universe . how ridiculous that it was that he hated everyone who worked for him with all his might . most of the time . one of his
[226/1000]	" for whatever reason i believe a lot of things i was wrong , that there was something wrong with me . she was n't a vampire . that 's what she was ! i know everything there is to
[227/1000]	" why do n't you go to the beach and come back here right now . she 's not worth it . " " yeah , i 'll ask you both . you can have the girl so much
[228/1000]	his eyes raked over her , moving the lower half of her body with quick , leisurely sweeps . " then how do you have a memory of moving between my spread legs , of sucking and groping my c
[229/1000]	the rest will work out . we just hope they do n't get nervous without the element of surprise . " the elevator went down to the thir tieth floor , and i hurried out to go to my
[230/1000]	the first thing i noticed was that my lips were tingling . my own lips were still buzzing . i wanted to go for a drink . back , time , and present day . " just
[231/1000]	he reached out his hand and captured mine . " this is my lucky day , " he said softly . " let 's go talk to them . " my dad had been a doctor a long time
[232/1000]	" i 'm fine . " i start the car behind her . but then she starts to turn the car around , so i cut her off . " sit down , callie . " she frowns
[233/1000]	" no , he looks worse than it is , " i told him . " he 's going to try to cut us up a little , " bex pointed out . " you go tell him we
[234/1000]	" i do have , " she said through gritted teeth , digging her heels into his flank . " no , you do n't , angel . " he turned his head to look at her , his
[235/1000]	" yeah ... " he replied . " but they 'll never need that much cash , not if they 're just here to stay . " he went to the window and then to the bed , pulling
[236/1000]	he chuckled , <EOS> i 'm doing a very good job . he waved them to an empty chair next to him and slid his chair a little closer . " come sit . " his eyes grew large
[237/1000]	i started to say something , but before i could , he put the blanket over me again . and the darkness dragged me under again . i woke up to find myself back in my bed in
[238/1000]	if he was at a nightclub playing god , he was definitely not here drinking , even after he 'd spent an hour with kate and one of her friends . " where is your friend ? "
[239/1000]	" you can say that again , i do n't think any of us will remember . " " we could take a ride in her car . it 'll probably be a bit quieter . " "
[240/1000]	" i have n't eaten any breakfast yet . " she looked back at the phone . " what are you going to tell her in your letter ? " " i think i 'm going to have to
[241/1000]	" then you ought to be careful , " ben said , his voice weary . peter shook his head . " not without answers to my own questions . " " how many are there ? "
[242/1000]	" it 's cool . the other day i felt rather sick . " " but now you 're fine . " the hospital had made numerous stops in those areas of the city that looked down on
[243/1000]	on the other hand , what good did it do for the girl to have to worry about it when she was gone for a few days ? i supposed i could n't answer that . and maybe it was
[244/1000]	his smile was still mocking , but somehow i could always tell when he was remembering how my blood smeared his smile and who and what i was . maybe it was that they both loved each other that had
[245/1000]	one of the other creatures had crawled up her calf ; its eyes were now fixed on the floor . she grabbed the leg and heaved it to go around the beast , and it sat up with a snarl
[246/1000]	he was sure it did , but he felt his cheeks redden . " he 'll keep it and keep the rest , " bill said casually , but when he dropped his gaze , andy saw only a few
[247/1000]	" i am . there are things which you might want to know about , " <EOS> ... " " perhaps because i am young and for the last of course , " she answered , " i think
[248/1000]	" oh , he did n't say that ! " " but he was in your church , did n't he ? " anna laughed . " how would you be able to know that ? the church
[249/1000]	" the queen 's guard ? " she questioned . " where is all this coming from ? " " ah , i believe you are correct , my queen . the regent knew these women in the days
[250/1000]	" you 're lucky , " mrs. butter worth said . " your work would be so difficult to fill . " " are you mad ? " said charlie . " it 's not mine . "
[251/1000]	" well , that was stupid , was n't it ? not that my life was one big mistake . but ... " she started talking about the pictures . her voice , high pitched and self - possessed ,
[252/1000]	and then she found him . but how did he tell them that and why ? <EOS> at the picture was n't true " why did n't have a different way of taking out before the truth
[253/1000]	i opened the door to the building , looking up and down the long metal stairway to make sure we were alone . i glanced over my shoulder . the light was still on in the hallway , but no
[254/1000]	" they are but some sort of shadows . " he said . even his tongue was a thick ball of oil . " i 'm sure they were just fig ments . i am sure they were not
[255/1000]	i did n't know he did this every time he went to his cousin 's wedding and then on his wedding day . " is that why ? " he shook his head and the look on his face
[256/1000]	" she 's dead ! " sam wailed , his voice cutting through the cries of pain . " she 's dead , " he mumbled into his hands . " and you 're going to listen to me
[257/1000]	" did you come here alone ? " i asked . " yes . " it was a statement . " after all the partying , i thought there would be some one - on - one time
[258/1000]	" yes . " " he 'd have plenty of allies . in fact , his connections to the west would ensure his death because of this . " " it sounds as if he was a powerful
[259/1000]	" i was so distracted that i did n't look as if i was going to catch that big , beautiful eye of yours . but believe me , i saw you . " she walked over to me and
[260/1000]	" a piece of cake , " she says , shrugging . " after you do that , you can pay me back . " i smirk , leaning over her to kiss her . " god just got
[261/1000]	" yes ! if i did n't go ahead with my plan . are you going to hurt them ? " " no , " she said , shaking her head . " but i 'll let them touch
[262/1000]	you have to take this chance for all of us . she touched the memory of the look in his eyes , had to see how his soul was splintered into something else entirely , a pure , hard
[263/1000]	" so here we are , " she said , " and we 're talking two men . one of them has his face turned up , and he 's shouting , and i 'm telling you , you know
[264/1000]	" sure . i just , well , that 's just the way it works . " his brows was lowered thoughtfully , and he frowned at me . " who uses a condom around you ? "
[265/1000]	but it would have been hard to lie to me . just as it would be impossible to lie to the man i held so dear . i 'd given up my pride years before and would never do it
[266/1000]	" yes , " he growled . " you said some incredible things to me : about how i had my chance to take you . how my love for you had no limits and that i was n't going
[267/1000]	the second had found him and his friends sitting near the back of a large crowd . he looked at them and then turned back to find that the room had become a cacophony of noise . one of the
[268/1000]	if only you were here , you would be amazed how a simple task like this could create such awe in the eyes of many . perhaps you will see some people think differently as well . but he
[269/1000]	" i do n't think so . i think he was looking at me . " " you 're wrong . " " why ? because he does n't know about you ? " " because we 're
[270/1000]	" good gods , you 're so damned stupid ! " " you wanted to be a lord . " that sounded like him . " why would i want to be a lord ? " "
[271/1000]	" a black cat ? " i asked . " more likely a fox or deer . " " a black lynx ? why in hell , on a silver foil ? " " a lucky guess
[272/1000]	" you do n't give a rat 's ass why i care ! " the stranger started toward the stranger , but paused , staring back to see if ben followed . several of the man 's companions were still
[273/1000]	" what is that ? " " i 'm going to make you something to eat now . " she picked up her bag and made her way to the door . " but first , you must be
[274/1000]	" that 's what they were telling me . the first year here . they were talking about moving here . out on my truck . " " i thought it was a small farm . " "
[275/1000]	or she could just lie back and let him take her . the need to cling to him was fierce . the heat in her blood was scorching . she 'd always had that need , something fierce and wild
[276/1000]	" no , but he has taken part in ... well , " i felt my gut tightening at the memory of the killing . " killing ? " mom asked in horror . " oh no , sweetie
[277/1000]	he sat up in bed . " that 's right . you had a couple . " i shrugged . " yeah , i never had no issues with it before . i just seemed to be using it
[278/1000]	" so it 's not a coincidence that he 's here . " " you 're not going to call him ? " " not right now . maybe not ever . " he reached forward , took
[279/1000]	" you know i ca n't do that , " i said , sitting back . " he 's going to hate that , so i wo n't let the fight go on anymore . let him come with us
[280/1000]	' there 's only me and you . do n't be ashamed of your feelings . ' she frowned at him and shook her head . now she knew what he meant . she sighed in pleasure as the
[281/1000]	he sat down on a bench and ran his hand through his hair . " it 's all very good , is n't it ? i mean , " he continued , " to be at home alone .
[282/1000]	" and , that <EOS> we ? and if you 're a good , good , just for an hour or two at night . that 's the way you are . i got your back . " i
[283/1000]	the thing was , emma had no idea where thayer got past the guard at the hospital , or who he might have been holding prisoner . she 'd lost track of him while she was in the hospital ,
[284/1000]	" that 's her favorite shirt . " i told him . " you have n't seen her wear anything besides a t - shirt , i do n't think i should see her wearing anything but a tank
[285/1000]	" your mother , " he said . " your mother has lost everything . " " you are so good to me , " she said . in the silence where his breathing was labored , she said
[286/1000]	" no , no ! " she repeated as if this was the most common answer in the world . " it 's all right , " he told me gently . " i know it is n't .
[287/1000]	it is going to be a long day , thought peter , but i have a good idea what day it is . can you tell me when i will get another chance ? and where am i going to
[288/1000]	" that , " she said while watching him , " is a very good question , though . " " have you yet learned not to read the english language so well ? " she laughed and
[289/1000]	" no , well we did n't ! " " it does n't have to be , she wo n't remember me , " he reassured me . <EOS> ... a secret the way he was getting the
[290/1000]	" do n't worry we would n't have had to do it if you had n't shown up . " " just your fault , i did n't follow your orders . " i said . i did n't
[291/1000]	he lifted his face to smell and saw a flash of scarlet up ahead . he veered his nose toward the trail . a group of men were firing at someone . " move ! " thomas
[292/1000]	jake was staring at him . " so what the hell are you waiting for on your computer ? " " it 's my birthday . " " seriously . what the hell kind of party is this
[293/1000]	and then he dropped his hand . " who put you there ? " i asked . " an old friend had the privilege and the security , " hawk answered , his eyes not leaving me .
[294/1000]	i stopped dead in my tracks . " why ? " i asked . " because he does n't deserve it ? " " no , " he repeated slowly . " because he 's a bad guy .
[295/1000]	" right . " he rubbed the back of his neck . " why was i so suspicious ? " " did n't you sense something was off when we left the clinic ? " " probably ,
[296/1000]	" no , honey . you do n't understand . you 're not seeing a very good man no matter what you tell him - his family , her people - and they 've all screwed up a lot lately
[297/1000]	" really ? " the older man said doubtfully . " tell us ! " a child chimed in . a woman rushed over and grabbed the older man 's hand . " we have to go ,
[298/1000]	" that place is full of ghosts , " i mumbled softly like i had n't said it for a few minutes . " i do n't think i could see them all and be convinced to believe them !
[299/1000]	" we 're talking about the boy back at his cottage , " she warned . " we 're talking about the girl and her mother sitting in the tree with the knife . " the big man 's
[300/1000]	" get out ! " cole shouted . " you ca n't , not now ! this is more than you deserve ! " the driver slammed on the brakes and bounced . cole jerked back , his knee
[301/1000]	he laughed . " you will do ... as you wish . i will give you the land . all you need do is tell them not to go and not say ' excuse me . ' i will send
[302/1000]	" we 're here , " he said . a huge tent stood in the middle of the field beside the track and a dozen or so tents were tied up side by side , a good - sized encampment
[303/1000]	" let me rephrase that . the only reason your grandfather allowed you to come here was that he thought i was the only one who could help you with this problem . if i make you do whatever it
[304/1000]	" but it looks exactly like him , " adam said . " right ? " i shook my head . " no . there 's no way . " chapter 32 he studied the small sign
[305/1000]	" i made you breakfast . " i handed him a pancake , which he happily accepted , then grabbed his milk and took it back to his room . he did n't sleep much last night . he
[306/1000]	" i know , " she said , grinning up at him , " at one point , an elder was the one who made me go through the procedure , making sure nothing major happened . but when the
[307/1000]	" do not be nervous , my dear . i intend you perfect . " she looked at him in bewilderment . " perfect for what ? " he brushed his lips over the tip of her nose
[308/1000]	" oh do n't worry . " his voice was soft . " that was just idle talk . i have a surprise for you . " with that , he spun on his heel and was gone .
[309/1000]	" i do n't believe him , " hannah said , and her voice sounded small . he held up a hand . " then let me talk to him . " mike 's phone rang in his
[310/1000]	" you 'll be the first ? " " no , " she said . " i thought that since i had n't been dead , i could see beyond the walls of the castle . " he
[311/1000]	my body convulsed and my head rolled back , but ren did n't stop . his teeth pressed into my neck and he repeated , " fuck , sylvie . fuck , jesus . " " yes ,
[312/1000]	his gaze tracked over the girls before he nodded his approval . one of the vampires was bound to a chair and the other was pressed against the wall . once his demon had been released , the vamp had
[313/1000]	he held up the letter . " i can have this taken to the police or someone , since you all seem to be upset . " she took it from him . her hands were shaking and she
[314/1000]	" tell me . " finally she just shook her head as though she could n't . " there 's " - she was going to explain , but her voice caught , she swallowed , then continued by
[315/1000]	and so it was that while you were n't supposed to get too close to any of the family , you also were n't supposed to stay very far away too long either . when my parents got divorced
[316/1000]	" you saw me . " i said . " i saw you come in here with your friends . you 're a fine young woman . you should n't be out of bed . but i am .
[317/1000]	no answer . chapter seven " no ! " this was clearly not a good sign . i quickly checked again for security cameras , but they continued to be there . i did n't even try
[318/1000]	but you do n't want to be right . " would you stop saying that ? you want to have fun . you ... like ... me . " he grins . " look at you . "
[319/1000]	the door opened , and a girl with brown hair , who looked to be in her early twenties , stuck her head in and asked if they needed anything . she looked upset . i asked her exactly who
[320/1000]	" the king wants me , though . " " right . " " a great king , " isa said , " and he only needs one girl for his head ? " " that 's
[321/1000]	" i 'm not , " she stated flatly . " you have n't been yourself , olivia , " he countered . " what are you saying ? you 're telling me not to worry about a
[322/1000]	he waited for a response . his jaw dropped slightly , but he was n't surprised . he 'd known they 'd have bad business . an hour later , he knew they were n't going to be found
[323/1000]	on the second day , the guards woke my lord . my squire arrived and told them he had been found by his wife in the city , and that he had to return with his sword . then my
[324/1000]	" i said get ready . " she waved me off even though i had to yell for her to do it . " and get over here . " " yes , ma'am . " i ran over
[325/1000]	" i 'm always with my friends . " jack frowned . <EOS> " you 're your parents ' kid . what business is it of yours ? " " i 've got nothin' to do with yours
[326/1000]	before i could answer the door , there was a loud and rapid hammering at it . i could n't look away from the door as my heart began to beat faster , and a chill ran through me
[327/1000]	i shake my head . " i do n't want to talk about this anymore . " he pats my arm . " okay , fair enough . " " but , i do n't want to -
[328/1000]	" the moment i was caught , i could tell by the way the others ' faces changed , their breath shortened , they were confused and bewildered ... " " to do what ? " i prompted .
[329/1000]	* * * " um , um , " i started when i was ten feet from the sidewalk . no amount of water in my head would change this conversation <EOS> on the back instead of this ,
[330/1000]	her stomach knotted as she realized this afternoon was supposed to be just about her . with nothing more to do than sit around for three hours , she was too nervous to stop <EOS> all around the water ,
[331/1000]	" i did n't do anything wrong . i think this is the one . the one . " her words came out as a growl , and her hand was shoving at his chest . " but i think
[332/1000]	she took a long deep breath in the air . she 'd been so busy trying to get him alone that she had completely forgotten how hot he 'd look in the morning . she waited , just as
[333/1000]	he pulled her close and she slipped her arms around his neck . " then yes , " he answered thickly . " i thought i would be hurting her but there was no pain . it was like
[334/1000]	james said , " what about the ghost ? " " what ghost ? " " that 's right , james . " " oh , " i said . " i do n't think you
[335/1000]	she did n't answer . she was too busy watching him get undressed . " i 've got to tell you , " he said looking at himself in the mirror . " someone scared the crap out of
[336/1000]	" we have an old home here . our mother died when we were three but my dad still visits . " she glanced back at me . " we were just like each other . when you were born
[337/1000]	the three were joined by two men from another line . they were n't tall men , but from what i could make out their features , the men had wide shoulders and an incredible build . one of
[338/1000]	where are they ? what the f * * k ? not knowing if it was a trick , she was almost afraid to leave her new friends and the man who was all she had left .
[339/1000]	" oh , you 're here tonight ? is it some kind of religious thing , like you should have been if you were going to bring that clown of yours here for the party ? " emma asks ,
[340/1000]	the sun was just setting over the mountains . he was tired but still ready to fight for his girl . he should have been fighting with his people as well . he knew there were still enemies , but
[341/1000]	" not even ? i wanted the whole story . " " i have it . with the police coming after your mother , i figured it was best to come clean . " she closed the book and
[342/1000]	the four moved back into the group and the group stood for some time between them all . and the remaining three members of the circle remained silent throughout that time . until carthinal said , ' all here ,
[343/1000]	" she 'll be back , " i murmured . quinn leaned his head against the door frame and closed his eyes , exhaling slowly . " you have no idea how miserable i am at the thought of
[344/1000]	before he could answer her , she gasped , " what is it ? " her breath caught in her throat , and he felt her tremble again , as if she needed to hold on to something .
[345/1000]	" and what sort of life did your parents have ? " " they were happy , loving , and successful . " " so who do you think was taking care of them ? " she
[346/1000]	" that i do , " she said , a bit unsure of herself . " it 's been a nice night , though . " she glanced at the sky in disbelief . " time we went home .
[347/1000]	" can i get a pen ? maybe we can make a statement , " i said . the cop turned it to a pad of paper on his desk and wrote down something in black - and -
[348/1000]	" what does it mean ? " i ask . i have n't even really forgotten about where we 're going yet . " go get some sleep . it 'll all happen the way it is , "
[349/1000]	" what did you say ? " " nothing . " " you must have said something ! " " just an old nickname i think . " " yes . as in , something that
[350/1000]	" so it always works out . " she looked at him with tears in her eyes . once again , she was breaking his heart . no , not breaking . " i 've made a terrible
[351/1000]	i should be flattered , really . it was probably what he wanted for us . but i did n't feel anything for him . i knew i thought he was in love with me but i did n't know
[352/1000]	she began to shake her head . " no , not that either . i mean i know this is crazy , but he could be having an affair . how could you let him do such a thing ?
[353/1000]	" i thought he lived with his dad . " " he does . " " so , they could n't be working on you ? " he chuckled . " we 've done what you and
[354/1000]	after all you lived for them , and did you ever see the rest of your family , like the rest of us ? she 'd asked . her voice cracking , ellie lowered herself <EOS> ' ... the others
[355/1000]	he pressed a kiss to my forehead . " you want to sit out on the porch for some time ? " " sure , " i said . " where are all the dogs ? " i wondered
[356/1000]	" it was his brother 's , " she explained . but my eyes did n't leave charlie 's . " i 'll keep that in mind , " i replied , as did sam . then
[357/1000]	her body trembled , and her beautiful face would be scarred for life for a bit , but that was all . she forced a smile . " now , my only question is , are you still serious ?
[358/1000]	" my mother was your mother , " she said , her voice low and fierce . he straightened and pulled away from her . the move made the red of her eyes flicker , but not go completely
[359/1000]	the three men looked at each other , then left their respective chambers to have a sit down . in the front of the room , i heard some noise . my face grew very warm . there
[360/1000]	mike [ the boy who comes to the door of my bedroom in the middle of the night , crying . ] mike you were still a kid . you do n't remember anything , just cry
[361/1000]	he shook his head , still struggling not to tear the envelope open . " why have n't you sent them back ? " " because i could risk it . to me . to us . i 'd
[362/1000]	the other twin said nothing , but his lips twitched . i stared at nick , feeling a little jealous . " you know , if nick does n't like it , his dad can just have him off
[363/1000]	it was the evening since i 'd gone into my surgery , and now i was sitting on the floor in the small room with the door standing wide open . the wind was blowing the light brown curtain
[364/1000]	" i 'll let you know when i get past this guy . " " yeah , yeah she has , what a great way for her to give me a run for my money . " she turned
[365/1000]	i 'm out of there , i think . i 'm out of it and i do n't know how i know with certainty . on my feet , i run from the house . chapter 43
[366/1000]	then again , they had been in the bedroom of a man called daniel . and something in him that he did n't want to name stirred as he stood up and shook out his clothing . " oh ,
[367/1000]	" because ... ? " the boy took another look into his eyes , " you 're looking far away , " said him , " you have one , i think . " michael smiled at him
[368/1000]	i do n't know what i expected , but it was n't this . she started giggling again and i frowned as she grabbed my hand . " you can open it now , " she said .
[369/1000]	" hello ? " " i do n't know why you called , " a younger woman said . " i 'm on a date . " this time it was me . " i do n't
[370/1000]	he did n't answer . " <EOS> his highness , perhaps you should inquire about my mother . " i pulled the phone with a frown the rest of the way out of the room . she would
[371/1000]	" i feel a great deal more secure because of this . i just have to think of how much it will hurt to hear someone say that . " " well , you need to think about everything
[372/1000]	" just do it , " he said , not meeting my eyes . he would n't let me . " take them up , " i said , sliding the box over to him . he rolled
[373/1000]	" i like it , " i said quickly . " now , if you 'll excuse me , i need to go look for the right thing . " a voice called from behind me . "
[374/1000]	" with , " i muttered then took a sip before i asked . " not sure . the town was quiet last night , " he answered and i looked at him . " so , " he
[375/1000]	" is that so ? " " maybe so . " i looked at the way she tried to keep her expression blank and forced a smile . " it 's cool . i think i 'd be
[376/1000]	but the queen 's anger seemed to be on a higher level . " you 'd better get back there , " she said , her voice soft . not a menacing one . " yes , mother
[377/1000]	" there is more . " he motioned behind them . she looked and saw the back of a building with the words " research laboratory " painted above the door . it was an entrance to an old
[378/1000]	" my mother had nothing to do with their divorce , " sam said . " they were still in love . and when they were younger , they did enjoy a lot of the same things i enjoy .
[379/1000]	you 're my wife . " she blinked slowly . if she got her heart rate under control , she could probably manage to ignore this . she had to have an issue here , she realized . "
[380/1000]	" it 's not as bad as it looks , " said joe . " i doubt it . we 're looking for a local , and there are plenty around here . " " did n't jack
[381/1000]	" that 's not true ! " " and my father is not senile . " the girl stared at him levelly . " he has had many patients , from what i hear . besides , i did
[382/1000]	her brow furrows . she looks like she 's not going to like what i 'm about to say . i 've heard enough from other people that it 's often the worst thing to say to a person they
[383/1000]	<EOS> we can all hear his laughter as he goes about his business . of course , i 'm not so focused on what he 's talking about . i keep looking at the faces of my friends who are
[384/1000]	" i 'm not surprised . you do n't . you 're just as confused and terrified as i was . you saw them . you smelled them . you saw the things about me that you never saw .
[385/1000]	he did n't laugh . just the opposite : he laughed so hard he had to grab her by the shoulders to stop himself from vomiting . but it did n't matter ; she was n't going anywhere until
[386/1000]	" are you kidding ? ! " i shouted into the distance . the old man smiled . " do n't you remember ? it 's the same old thing . and no , you 're not . i
[387/1000]	" there 's a man right near here , " the sergeant exclaimed over his shoulder . " he wants to talk to you . " " who ? " " a mr. david webb , a sergeant
[388/1000]	" do n't ! " he yelled . " you know that 's not true . you ca n't believe that , not at all . " " it 's true ! " i shouted back . " i
[389/1000]	" i 'm not afraid of dogs . " " good , that will keep you out of trouble , " she said , and my mood must have turned sour because i saw a look of shock wash
[390/1000]	" yeah . she 's great . " she was trying to keep up with me as i started walking down the hall - toward my room , only stopping when the bottom dropped out of my stomach .
[391/1000]	" you 're my friend , i would just bet , " replied the younger man . " but , look where you 're headed up there anyway . " he pointed towards where the car door of the car
[392/1000]	" get out of the building , " he said calmly . he waved his arm around in the direction of the police car . " move ! get out of the building ! " they pushed past me
[393/1000]	" you know , " he continued , still moving me toward him , " the thing with you is , you get into trouble for something you did n't do and you 're in trouble so you 're gon
[394/1000]	by the time he finished in his office , he had to admit that the woman had certainly caught his interest . he never saw her around the shop , but he 'd been impressed by the fact that
[395/1000]	the next two days passed in a flurry of activity and soon her name was called on the news again . john could n't have been more surprised to hear from her family , who claimed that she was
[396/1000]	the vampire grabbed her by the arms . his eyes were red and glowing , and his skin , normally smooth , was turning golden with sweat and pain . the blood would heal , but the skin might not
[397/1000]	" because . that 's how it should happen - someone like me . no pressure , no ego . " she sat there for a few seconds , the rain falling softly . " well . it takes
[398/1000]	" no , " he muttered , " then i do n't know what i 'd be ? that 's life . " the waitress brought my diet coke and he brought another beer . i took a second
[399/1000]	" i can not , madame , there is nothing but the dead . you can ask the man who shot it to return it . " " who is he , monsieur ? " " the man
[400/1000]	" no worries , mrs. christie . we will be . " his mother looked at her wristwatch with dismay . " ten o'clock . i 'm going to bed now . i want to be properly acquainted with
[401/1000]	" yes sir , " replied sergeant scarburg . " i will have your first radio check - out is 3 p.m. it 's 10 o'clock . " " ok , sarge , we better get going .
[402/1000]	the fact that he 'd used that tone of voice just to please her had her rubbing her hands anxiously up and down the steering wheel . she wished that she could do something to reduce the terrible tension building
[403/1000]	" we 'll deal with it when and if it happens . " " and if we do n't ? " she asked timidly , trying to wrap her mind around a dark , hungry panther living in the
[404/1000]	i was having a really good time . there was no one in the whole corner besides the couple . one girl from the lunch line stopped and gave me a sweet good - bye , but the other one
[405/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said . " you understand ? " he nodded . " there are words , " she said . " people like you and me , we 've always been
[406/1000]	at first he was disappointed , but on the next full moon he was as happy as he could get for at least . after the third full moon he was so happy that he even laughed .
[407/1000]	" no . i 'm sorry . my fault for not appreciating your offer to take one of the suvs to a local shelter . it 's just that things have been a little hectic around here since my brother
[408/1000]	" sure i do , " i said . and i said it . they started laughing . " dude , yeah , yeah , " said one of them . " you 're an asshole , man .
[409/1000]	" how do i know ? maybe you used your powers for something else . " maybe i should have left him behind . " so you just picked up and split ? " " that 's part of
[410/1000]	" wow , " i mumble . " she 's a terrible actress , " bryson adds . even becca , who happens to be the only girl bryson 's always around while on our softball team ,
[411/1000]	his hands went to my ass as he slid me up the length of his body , in the space of five seconds , until his shaft was buried to the root , my h * ps lifted to him
[412/1000]	what the f * * k was going on ? max and his brothers were supposed to be here with us ! now he was a prisoner at the keep ? " my mother thinks you 're in
[413/1000]	" but we can not afford to waste time . " " but ... " " did n't i warn you ? " when her voice trailed off , he heard the resignation of a female who
[414/1000]	" please , " i whisper . " you have to let her go . she 's lost .... " * * * his face , my voice , is his favorite . he 's smiling behind his
[415/1000]	" no , honestly , i 'm better than this . " " you 're drunk , " he says , trying to put a stop to the argument , trying to make my argument about being sober and
[416/1000]	" a little farther , " i said , looking into the dark forest . " why ? " " i do n't want to get lost out there . " " it will be fine .
[417/1000]	" i 'm pretty sure that this lady has a sister , maybe a brother . " " well , i do n't really have a sister , but mom said one could find one . " "
[418/1000]	you do n't like getting shot , do you ? then do you . as one . as one . until they learn to get over it . and one , <EOS> a thousand times . and one ,
[419/1000]	" if i do n't see him tonight , then i 'll know it 's not true . " " you think that he will bring you a present tomorrow morning ? " " yes . "
[420/1000]	" and i 'll bet he would n't give you any information in return , would he ? " " he 'd be grateful if you came with me , sweetheart , " mom replies , her phone now
[421/1000]	" i had you on tape . " that was all you got . do n't forget it ; i 'll bet you 're just itching to start your comeback again . i saw the spark of something behind
[422/1000]	what ? ! he closed his fist around the shaft . " yes . " * * * * * the blood of the young had already run down the demon 's chest , staining his
[423/1000]	' what did you say ? ' asked the dwarf . ' nothing , except that it looks like a very large pool of some dark liquid , ' said the dwarf . ' it looks like some kind
[424/1000]	" i would n't . no sense in spoiling the surprise . " her laughter was like the caress of fingers down the inside of her palm . her laughter echoed loudly in the crowded silence of the plane
[425/1000]	" i could not care less if you could , after what you 've been through . " he began pacing . " i find not even my heart can endure a child . an infant infant - i have
[426/1000]	the lights dim , and the music stops . the lights start again and two men stroll past me . the man looks handsome , with sandy blond hair , wide shoulders , and matching moustache . he wears a
[427/1000]	the two men were nearly six feet tall . his face was chiseled in a way that gave off strength . " take it easy , " he told the man with the gun . " we 're not here
[428/1000]	" i 'm sorry , are you alright ? " the man asked with concern . " i 'm fine , " rachel said , wiping her eyes and nose with the palm of her hand . "
[429/1000]	" um me too , " nick agreed . claire chuckled . " the fact it 's a girl is <EOS> on the living - " " it can make him like to be mad at the end
[430/1000]	her arms were aching . so he was n't hurting her after all . did this mean she was supposed to die right along with him ? the car screeched to a stop . she turned toward him ,
[431/1000]	" he has , " eric agreed . " and if i understand anything you say correctly , i thought he loved you . " " i think , yes , i was at the funeral , thank you
[432/1000]	i stepped up at that moment to get a better view of the scene out the back , and there was the blonde with her hands behind her head , one knee bent , as if she was n't wearing
[433/1000]	" in the moment of weakness . " was his voice still hot ? she could n't tell . she wondered if she 'd look this bad to everyone . " that 's how it works . you decide
[434/1000]	" are you saying i gave him a bad name ? " " not exactly , " i say honestly , because i never told jason anything that was n't true . i think he realizes the weight for
[435/1000]	" i do n't think to worry , captain , they 're in the process of changing their minds . they 'll meet the same fate as any other human we 've encountered here . we may be able to
[436/1000]	and there he was , watching her , reading them as she was reading him , the words almost a question . he did n't notice her glance over her shoulder , but she sensed him watching her .
[437/1000]	" now where were we ? oh , yeah . you were about to tell me how you were going to try and beat your magic back to earth . i needed to hear to see if you were a
[438/1000]	he sighed . " i do n't know what you mean . " " you do n't ? " i raised my eyebrows . it was true that i 'd never understood these things of our people before .
[439/1000]	on the other hand , she was pretty confident that she had taken the time to dig a little deep before acting . " why do you think that he felt the need to flee this city ? besides
[440/1000]	" where in the hell is she ? " " i do n't know . if you had n't found her , i would n't be here . " " you 're in a trance ? " he
[441/1000]	but as soon as he dropped the towel and lifted one fine leg , he froze . his mouth dropped open and his eyes went wide . she was dripping wet . but all the water from her body
[442/1000]	" i know they do n't love me . they love themselves . most of the time they do n't care what anyone else thinks . " she turned to see michael 's eyes were still closed . he looked
[443/1000]	she sat next to him as he wrote , her eyes closed and not moving from her notebook . " i 'm sorry for what happened today , " he said , feeling an urge to defend her -
[444/1000]	" i have another job for you . " michael placed his hands on my shoulders , forcing me to look up at him . i was certain i could have done without the heat burning in his eyes
[445/1000]	" like i said , " he said , " it is a wonderful night . " " but do you know who is on it ? let 's look for two people that you know quite a bit
[446/1000]	" but he was n't taking you or anyone else to him , " she reminds me . " and i do n't want to admit to you that i 'm jealous . i was n't worried about you two
[447/1000]	once he was in his chair , he stared at me blankly . " the papers , " i said . he looked at the papers , then at me . " so that 's it . "
[448/1000]	" you are supposed to meet the prince tonight , but not alone . i need you at the palace immediately and you will be at my signal . " " it is n't a good idea the guards
[449/1000]	' the same as always ! ' ' then we 'll go slow ! ' ' too slow you mean ! ' ' when are we leaving ? ' ' i 'm keeping the ship in
[450/1000]	" i 'm not a monster or a monster . i give all that up . " " i did n't know you could speak , " he said solemnly ; then he let the subject drop .
[451/1000]	but first , she needed to get out . he led her through the front door and closed it behind them . the cool light bounced off the marble floors and the hardwood floor was spotless . "
[452/1000]	" as i was saying ... " i quickly re checked the calendar in the kitchen . " we 're the first three . do you know the night we put in a party for these types of people ?
[453/1000]	" he is a good man . he 's a good husband and wonderful father . i do n't expect you to be happy about this . it 's been a long time since i 've felt this way .
[454/1000]	he grinned and said , " it 's an absolute pleasure to meet you , " and then , " come eat with me . " the waiter came by and took their order and marcus quickly looked around noticing
[455/1000]	i heard the wind on my door frame when we both stopped . " does it really matter ? " he whispered . he got a very shaky breath . i saw it , saw his eyes fill with tears
[456/1000]	now she can hear footsteps in the passageway . " not possible ! " she hears someone say . " is the city 's fire not a safe place to build , " the larger woman replies .
[457/1000]	i had n't noticed them until the words were out that i smiled up at luke . " you do n't have to dance with me , " i said . " i 'm fine . " "
[458/1000]	" that 's okay , " i said . " it 's nothing , really , " said the woman . " it 's just i do n't know anything with it . " " what do you
[459/1000]	she did n't even stop her mouth from biting down . the small , wet press of his tongue on her clit as he sucked her in were driving her wild . and the orgasm she 'd been holding off
[460/1000]	" yes ! " i said excitedly . " you know i can talk to any of the girls and do all of the things you wanted to . " " oh , i know you can , but
[461/1000]	' not the whole country ! ' the chief warder observed . ' the city ca n't be quite the same as the isle of the winds , either . people wo n't be able to get their hands on
[462/1000]	she looked her best for the walk out , but she shivered once in december , so that the chill in the air was evident . " oh , it 's fine , babe . i understand how much
[463/1000]	the vampire was not amused . his lips drawn tight , he ignored the burning pain of his wounds and straightened in his seat . " what brings you to london , lady gilbert ? " " i
[464/1000]	my heart stopped . " do i get to use your name and address ? " " not even remotely . " i tilted my head up so he could see my face . he stared at me
[465/1000]	" what did you do ? " david was suddenly sober , his eyes flickering to her and back to josie . " nothing . " " then whose is it ? " " we were at
[466/1000]	" i am going to be very busy ! " i exclaimed in exasperation . " well , i know . we 'll discuss it then . now , you will do what you are told . " her
[467/1000]	" what 's going to happen ? " " my mom is gone . i was supposed to come back home , but she wanted to try to make it on her own for a while . i guess
[468/1000]	so we said goodbye some distance away and headed back . we played a few ball games on the dirt , and then made the long journey to the lake . there was a huge boat tied up by the
[469/1000]	" well , now we know ! " said a voice excitedly behind him . " if i could just see your face i think i 'd swoon ! " " oh , spare you the compliments , "
[470/1000]	" what does that mean ? " i asked . " it means either you 're a very bad boy who just wants a relationship , a real relationship , or you 're an extremely bad boy who just
[471/1000]	" no ! " he cried , and then cried again , " no ! <EOS> " i went to my knees to help him , but it took all my courage remaining to keep him balanced . then
[472/1000]	" what is inside ? " he asks . " my sister , " says the older man . he touches my cheek and places a calming hand there . " is she going to be well ?
[473/1000]	the door to the bedroom swung open . a tall man and a beautiful woman exited . the man with the dark wavy hair followed in the line . " we were just going to take a walk ,
[474/1000]	all of them , i had been used to , the memory of at least five years of my life slowly fading , the pain of a little boy 's passing never coming back , the loneliness of that childhood
[475/1000]	" well , i 'll be damned , " said the captain . " he 's killed the cat . " " what 's a cat ? " asked ben . there was a long silence . "
[476/1000]	" i wish you would n't call me that ! " " you can call me whatever you want . it 's not bothering you anyway . " she snorted . " if it were n't for your
[477/1000]	" i see . you ... you 're looking so beautiful tonight , " he said softly . there were faint red circles under his eyes . he brushed a strand of hair from my cheek , lingering at
[478/1000]	he nodded , understanding by now . " well , the reason i have n't even begun training is that i 'm a trained killer . " " hmm ... that seems to be the case ... "
[479/1000]	" the hell ? " he said with disbelief . " at any rate , she knew you were staying in town , " she added with relief . " she 'd been expecting your return . "
[480/1000]	chapter thirty - two michael looked up from his desk when a knock sounded on his door . " come in , " he said . " ca n't i at least have a moment of your time ?
[481/1000]	" i do n't know why i had to find you out in public . i had to get out before ... " her voice faltered . " before i embarrassed myself . " " you did n't embarrass
[482/1000]	" fine . that 's fine . " " if the money keeps coming in , i have a good idea that someone needs to be back on track . " " oh , i understand . i
[483/1000]	" we found me , i think . they 're waiting for me in the back . " he stared at her . " he took you ? if he did , what did we do ? "
[484/1000]	" i 'm with you , " she muttered , and there was no mistaking the desperate expression in her eyes . her heart slammed against his chest , and he caught her chin in his hand . "
[485/1000]	and then he kissed her until she thought she would die from passion - the first time she 'd pressed him against a house of cards without fear of being hurt . afterward , the moonlight washed out everything
[486/1000]	" because you were my wife . " she stared up at him with eyes that were so much like his own but this time held more emotion . " and ? " he took her mouth with
[487/1000]	john , his back to us , continued to stand motionless . " come on guys , " jake said . " let 's <EOS> - it 'll turn our little friends - and we can sing our game
[488/1000]	" are you mad ? " he asked quietly . " mad of not being able to tell you i love you . sad that you 're going to go back to new orleans . " he groaned
[489/1000]	so tell me . " she smiled tentatively . " i 'm a writer , not a writer . " he nodded . " sorry , i get confused sometimes . " " what 's your
[490/1000]	" how sure are you that he actually meant to kill you ? " " he knew i was his daughter . like the rest of you , he just had to find a victim . " she
[491/1000]	my life and my relationship with daniel . he held in that i had failed him and he held in this that we were a team and that it was better for the two of us to make the first
[492/1000]	" you 'd better hope not , " i replied . " he 's not coming to the police station . he only makes it to this hotel because of me . " " he 's not coming here
[493/1000]	her body ignited at once , a fire in her belly and a deep ache between her thighs for a man she did n't know and would n't ever forget . " what am i talking about , cara
[494/1000]	" i 'm not going anywhere , " i promised to myself as i began walking toward the edge of the forest . " you ca n't make me , ivy . you ca n't make me kill myself
[495/1000]	and she 's thinking , you can do better , so much better . he knows it , but he says no . and still she goes . and then he sees the old man , walking toward
[496/1000]	" all right , dear boy ... " " thank you , dear . " she smiled when he smiled back . and she knew , just knowing , how they 'd be having this conversation when they
[497/1000]	" i 'm not taking him . i wish i could have listened , but the guy 's such a good listener , and we wanted to see if you knew anything about that , " added candi .
[498/1000]	" if you 're not going to help her , i 'll sleep on her floor . in fact , if you 're going to play devil 's advocate , i 'm doing it now . " " hell
[499/1000]	they both sat on the floor and used the kitchen as a place to change clothes , and she was worried as she walked down the hall to the guest bedroom . she knocked lightly on the door and a
[500/1000]	her face paled completely as she realized that he really did know everything about her . " i 'm sorry , sebastian . i 'm not trying to say i like you or anything . " " i know
[501/1000]	" you had me worried . what did you do with your brother when you left him in there ? did you ... see anyone else in there ? " " no . why would you think that ?
[502/1000]	this made me laugh . " yes , it seems my mother came up behind him and gave him a high five . apparently , she got a little wet that day . to be perfectly honest , i looked
[503/1000]	" do n't be ridiculous . i want to do all the work , " she said , using her full , assertive voice . " we need to do more than just talk . you 're going to
[504/1000]	the voice got louder . " tell me ! where is she ? " i had a feeling my voice could n't turn on him . he was too strong . he might have to hurt me .
[505/1000]	" well , " he says . " the one being pulled up ... it 's a ship . we all know the legend of the white horse . " " yes , captain , but that was not
[506/1000]	" i 'm a friend of the family , " james said . " but i 'm looking for a job . " she wrinkled her nose as if she did n't like what she saw in his eyes
[507/1000]	my father ? he 'd be fine with this ? he 'd been fine with being kidnapped and tortured and sent to the dark ages , and at his age , if he could ever forgive himself , then he
[508/1000]	' no , he 's not . ' ' no ? he would n't say anything . ' i opened and closed my mouth , shocked that he would not have . ' well , you 've wasted
[509/1000]	chapter twenty - five olivia awoke the next day to the cold , hard reality that she had no idea what had just happened . " where am i ? " she asked herself . the phone in
[510/1000]	" hey , " i muttered , and he reached up , kissing my cheek . " hey , " he murmured . he was lying down , and the covers were down around his waist . we had
[511/1000]	" and the one who died in that car accident ? i know he was a big part of your family - " " he was n't alive . they say <EOS> - he was still alive when they
[512/1000]	i am too , too young to travel . i have a new life to be on . what am i to do ? where to go and what is i to do ? " " i 'm sorry
[513/1000]	" we 're here . thanks for coming , lucas . i just wanted to make sure you knew how much you 'd accomplished so far . " " thanks , lucas , " lucas replied , glancing over
[514/1000]	" i do n't have a clue , jess . " he glanced back into the bed and found her staring at him , her eyes wide and her breath coming fast . he made a note to get
[515/1000]	" we 're going to give each other space , " she told him . her arms tightened around him and she pressed herself against him . " it would be wise if you allowed me to take care of
[516/1000]	a little voice whispered in the back of her mind that while she might have no answers , at the very least she could find some answers - some answers that would make her own life a hell more bearable
[517/1000]	" i would rather have a drink rather than do my duty as the duke of winter haven . " " now lady winter haven 's here , good man , " said haddington , " you can do
[518/1000]	" and was she married ? " " no . " " and that this was a scam ? " " uh , well , yeah , but i told you why i was using the word
[519/1000]	" i ca n't make a fire , " said heather . all at once , everything seemed clear . everything . nothing was perfect . one day a week : the church had taken over the floor
[520/1000]	" oh , really ? then let 's walk over to the hospital to let the doctor know it 's healthy . " they walked in silence , and by the time they got there , erin was crying
[521/1000]	" you 're playing with your cards , i guess , " he says with a smile , his eyes moving to look at my hands again . " you really like what you see ? " i joke
[522/1000]	he set his cup on the bar . " i never thought i 'd be able to get my heart broken . " the rest of the coffee was hot and delicious . he had a nice mouth .
[523/1000]	as they rode out on the road again , andy glanced over and her chest tightened . she 'd never seen him this upset before . " will something come up ? " he asked . "
[524/1000]	jason sat staring out the window , in no hurry to get there . his heart raced as he paced the room . his head was hurting and his knees threatened to buckle . he felt very close to collapsing
[525/1000]	" is there anything else , mr. president ? i can assure you i did not mean for this to happen . " " it 's something , mr. president , and it 's important , " he said
[526/1000]	" all right , then - " " do n't even think about it . " he pressed her to him . " i wo n't let you change your mind . " his lips brushed hers in
[527/1000]	they came to a tree about three hundred feet and six feet wide . " just look at what we 've got . " " oh , no , " whispered shadow . he did . it was the
[528/1000]	" if you get my phone number , i 'll send you something nice . " his eyes grew warm and serious . " or sometimes i 'd like you to bring me a bottle of champagne . "
[529/1000]	" no . " " but you were the one who brought him here . you were the one who made sure that he would do his job . " " i did n't know he was going
[530/1000]	" in all the years - " i began , but there was a click and the room was silent . the noise was coming from my phone and i pulled it forward , but as i did i
[531/1000]	" what kind of a woman is that ? " hunter said from beside me . his voice was low and filled with hurt and i felt like my heart was dying with anguish . " i do n't
[532/1000]	" so ... he did n't mean to kill me . " she smiled , " i guess i should take the credit . " " you ? " sam said , " you look like shite , actually
[533/1000]	we 're on the main road out of town . she asks if i do n't like the way my neck is turning and what i 'll have to think about for the rest of the trip on the way
[534/1000]	i have to admit that i 'm a little jealous that he 's with whoever she 's dating . " " i know the timing was terrible , " she said dryly . " she 's not dating
[535/1000]	mr. ver stee g , who had been taking pictures of the scene from a booth against the wall , shot a worried look at the strange - looking man who 'd taken the picture . " let 's get
[536/1000]	" i do n't know , " i said . " maybe it was all just some weird stuff . you know ... " what if what i 'm being told is what everyone else thinks ? " "
[537/1000]	" there ? " seth could n't contain himself any longer . " do what ? " seth shrugged , pointing to the edge of the roof ledge to where the stone had seemed to drip down almost from
[538/1000]	at the top of the stairs , the double doors were still closed and it seemed as though those who were still upstairs were not here in case the occupants woke up and were unable to see them . they
[539/1000]	" yes , i can . for if you 'd like to go back outside i 'll get you some soup , an apple , maybe a piece of toast . the little man ca n't go very far down
[540/1000]	then another wave of dark , terrifying shadows crept over us . at first it was just the rain but to my relief i saw a figure in a white hooded robe , coming towards the lake . its body
[541/1000]	her hands clenched in his robe , and he thought he saw the tips of her breasts , pink and straining beneath the thin cotton . she groaned . " i 'm not going to last long . go slowly
[542/1000]	" you said you got the first car . was your driving okay ? " he paused , but did n't answer right away , taking a drink from the glass of wine he 'd just poured himself .
[543/1000]	ethan laughed , then made sure he was n't followed . they emerged from the woods and sat on the back porch of the farmhouse . " will i be at school tomorrow ? " " yes .
[544/1000]	" why would you think i 'd want to marry someone who - " " who what ? " a hard shiver that started at her toes began to seep up her legs . " who you choose
[545/1000]	* * * one of the few things the house had seen these days was new year 's eve . the party had n't started for days , but alex had already gotten them cleaned up . now ,
[546/1000]	" i 'm right here . " i glanced out the open window and found him sitting beside me on the porch swing . the way he was looking at me drove me insane . i suddenly wished i was
[547/1000]	" you 've done well , " one of the ladies remarked as she held sarah close for an embrace . " thank you . i 've worked so hard to not offend this place . i hope i
[548/1000]	" what 's going on , pete ? " pete looked around . it was obvious which ones were on the island . " the boss said he wanted us out of the field by tomorrow morning . he
[549/1000]	" this is it ? we 're really here ? " sarah asked . " yeah , i am in a whole new world . " the man looked at her as he said , " wow , this
[550/1000]	i 've never known that to happen and it 's startling . " no . no , that was my birthday gift , " she answers , as if that makes perfect sense . " yours too ,
[551/1000]	the words they said the other day were still in my head , replaying then and now in my memory like a piece of music i could n't quite pick up in a play . she said she does
[552/1000]	she was standing in the front room , holding a framed photo with the local wildlife animals . the color of the picture was a vibrant green and the woman was a little shorter , holding up a hand to
[553/1000]	" i guess we got this , " sam said . it was a lot . he thought they were going to find the dead girl 's body in the graveyard . " no other way they could
[554/1000]	" wait up ! i 'm late ! " i yell , running into my own trailer . when i look up the person waiting for me is a boy - a younger version of chase or aaron . i
[555/1000]	' he was in prison . i do n't think they were allowed to lock us up . ' the silence that followed was broken by a shout , from the camp outside , that had no more than
[556/1000]	" the prince . " it was n't a question . he knew what i wanted to ask and i nodded almost imperceptibly . " my husband will keep it safe , " i repeated . " he will protect
[557/1000]	" no thanks ! " nate and i say in unison . " i will have to grab my stuff . " i wave a hand at nate and walk back inside to my room . i flop onto
[558/1000]	she let that blow pass . " go ahead and do it anyway . <EOS> - see anything , " she was a great to track , nothing you if we - when you knew you were nothing - just
[559/1000]	" we have no place to go , brother , and no idea of what we have to do . " the prince reached out to touch the prince 's hand , making the prince shudder , and nodded
[560/1000]	he could hardly believe anyone was actually getting married . he must be crazy . he shoved the thought away . it was n't right to get in people 's business . but it was something he 'd have
[561/1000]	but i would n't let him do that to me . so i went for it . i took one of my own big ones and put all my attention in it , my mind with it .
[562/1000]	" maybe . " the man was so lost in thought that he did n't feel my presence . " so , " i said , " did you see the bodies ? " he was distracted again
[563/1000]	he closed his eyes , and his eyes cracked open . " here . " " i wonder what that means ? " she 'd already finished the job of removing his jacket when she heard him stirring
[564/1000]	they went down to the third floor , the one furthest down the hall , just as the alarm was sounded and doors opened everywhere , bringing with them a flood of tourists . on the third floor ,
[565/1000]	" i wo n't let him . we 'll be there as quickly as possible . if you were n't expecting my arrival , just let them kill us and leave us alone . " no sound came ,
[566/1000]	she came forward just long enough to finish her glass of wine before he grabbed the wineglass , holding it out to her . " here , " she said , extending her hand to him . he took
[567/1000]	" oh boy , " jack grunted , knowing there was a very likely excuse for lily to not respond . she 'd told him she was upset after hearing about monica and the baby . he 'd thought she
[568/1000]	" what had i done to her , john ? " alice 's whisper was urgent , but it was n't very loud , and it was n't threatening . " nothing , she 's fine back there ,
[569/1000]	" <EOS> " my name was always above reproach . long before i was born . " though perhaps you were far too timid to know her to be my real daughter of light , " he sneered . the
[570/1000]	she got the same treatment once . " it must have been much better than she thought . " " she 's in the hospital in germany , she 'll be okay in a couple of weeks . "
[571/1000]	i shrug . " sorry to be all broo dy . what were you saying ? " " we 've been avoiding each other since the last time i saw you , " she says . " maybe i
[572/1000]	she reached out with a shaky hand and took his hand . his skin was warm beneath her fingers . he had an calluses pad on a ten - day - old hand . he stroked the backs of
[573/1000]	when they arrived back at the lab , everyone was in conference , but she made no effort to rejoin them . they had n't eaten anywhere in the last fifteen minutes , and the smell of her cooking had
[574/1000]	" what now ? " mark shouted , feeling the blood begin to run from his ears . he was sure he was getting his head pounded . " now we cut ! " said paul . now that
[575/1000]	" you are n't helping . tell me . " " <EOS> , huh ? do n't look at the girls who live in the swamp , but you want to know what i was doing . if there
[576/1000]	" oh , hell no ! " jason snarled , his gaze fixed on the ceiling . " because if that motherfucker is trying to cut off your tits , then i do n't want <EOS> f * * king
[577/1000]	" yes , you did , " i told her with as much amusement as i could muster . she ignored my comment and just beamed . " and you brought some in with you ? " i could
[578/1000]	" oh , " i said . " i 'm not sorry we were there . " " no , miss , i should remember that . " he gestured toward a bed in the center of the room
[579/1000]	" not with him . " he hesitated , then added , " we 're a little ... " he stopped himself . she lifted a brow and shrugged . " very jealous ? " he winced .
[580/1000]	as the sun rises , it 's still hot so max and i do n't have to stand outside . when we 've finished our drinks , i pull him into an embrace for several minutes . i wish i
[581/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " the men who were in our camp were murdered . " she hesitated , then said gently . " they were never even heard from again , " she said
[582/1000]	" i 'm not your boy . i do n't play with girls . " " but ... but ... " " i 'm over my damn girl ! " he cut his eyes to the guy in
[583/1000]	" you just told me that your entire family was a part of the group ? " " they were . " he leaned forward , as though testing me , and that did n't sound the smartest
[584/1000]	then , the old man made a sudden change in expression , a new set of eyes that looked up at the speaker who seemed to have been shouting his name . " we 're going to have to
[585/1000]	' my goodness , and he 's left so many ? that explains the car , but it also explains how he 's got the money . ' ' does he have it all ? do you have it
[586/1000]	" i am afraid , i 'm afraid of him , i 'm afraid of his words , " i said . " have a heart . " her voice was steady . the girl she 'd been was
[587/1000]	i did n't have a clue what a lot of words meant . it was just what my dad said . i glanced over and saw mom smiling at me . i do n't know if it was because i
[588/1000]	" where 's the nearest bus stop ? " " just down the street , in the road in front . " i pointed . " you should go there . the bus will take you there . i
[589/1000]	i sighed and then remembered my promise to lucy . " i was just talking about what the two boys were talking about in the bar . " lucy looked away from me with a shrug . " good
[590/1000]	what would her mother think ? " ah , " i said . " no , mother , you do n't have to worry about that . i shall do my best to clean up after the night 's
[591/1000]	and then she would get to see it . that was all . she would not go on the ship , and would only say something to the family she 'd already mentioned the day before , and make a
[592/1000]	but of course simon could n't quite make out that simon had said the words . then , as simon began his next step to the exit , the guy stepped up beside him to walk down to the door
[593/1000]	" you 're a pain in the ass , " jack says , staring at ryke , who starts tickling daisy 's stomach . " you ca n't even hold up your end of the discussion . " my
[594/1000]	" not <EOS> " " not . " " not this ... just a very long journey leaving the hotel when he looks straight ahead as if he 's not sure he 's seeing
[595/1000]	" no , " i told him , looking at his hands on my shoulders . " i 'm afraid you 'll just have ta leave . " " oh , god , " he said . " you
[596/1000]	' oh , yes , absolutely , ' agnes said . ' you would . oh , yes , you would ! ' she smiled brightly and threw herself in his arms , kissed him passionately . ' hello ,
[597/1000]	he took a sip of coffee , then took another , not certain he could digest the information . " what 's with all the jewelry ? " he asked , leaning forward . " i thought i
[598/1000]	" what are you doing ? ! " " just , stop screaming ! " he yelled back . " stop yelling ? you 're what , nine - year - old ? here i am , a
[599/1000]	" mr. henry would n't lie about something like that , " says his wife . " he would want you to be honest about what he 's been doing . " i look down at the dirty dishes
[600/1000]	" but he was there , " added the old man . " just as our best guards are . you told the truth . they got me . you let me go , and soon the police would find
[601/1000]	" if you will not help me , " the man said , " then i will leave you here the rest of your day . " he drew his blade and brought it slowly toward celaena . she flinched
[602/1000]	it is his right to do this . my mother knows he has a friend coming this way and as a result she wants to sit on the sidelines to watch , as he pushes the ice and slides out
[603/1000]	he pulled back and looked at her , brow furrowed . " but i 've been here all night . " " no , then you must have just been here . " " i should have left
[604/1000]	' he wo n't like to be used like a weapon . ' ' who 'll pay for a weapon like that or who will pay ? ' ' you , ' said the man . the
[605/1000]	i take a deep breath , take a shuddering step back , and pull the trigger . nothing happens . did this guy show ? of course , he did n't . i realize through the panic that
[606/1000]	" that 's where we 're from . " " you mean the old country ? " " yep . " " do you know how to play ? " " no . how are you
[607/1000]	" so ? " " i think i should pay him off as soon as i find him . maybe then i 'd know where her body is . maybe i 'd know if he was still alive .
[608/1000]	he gave two gentle tugs and , having gone through the change in size , the coat and gloves were gone . my head shot back . " shit . i did n't think about the f * *
[609/1000]	" i 'm going before my grandfather gets home , " i said to him , but i did n't dare kiss him . not when the expression on his face was so hopeful . it really did n't matter
[610/1000]	they both frowned for a moment . " are you looking for something to wear ? " he asked . " not really . i was just sitting in the room , thinking about the dream . "
[611/1000]	he 'd needed to get away and cool off so they could resume working together on the case , and he had n't wanted her to think he was some possessive type of beast . not in a couple weeks
[612/1000]	" it 's okay , your future mom has n't told you . i 'm kidding . i 'm sure everything is going to be wonderful . see ? now , get out ! " he yelled . "
[613/1000]	" well , i was actually taking the bus out here without my briefcase . i was hoping you might see something good . " " i do . that 's all you need . " he put the
[614/1000]	slowly , as if the memory hurt , she reached forward and ran her fingers lightly so that i winced when it made contact . when she withdrew her hand , her eyes were filled with love . " do
[615/1000]	" you 're a f * * king traitor , " she spat . the anger bubbled up inside of her . she did n't deserve him . she was n't the sweet , timid girl he 'd known
[616/1000]	' you do not know that here in the real world , ' he answered . ' we are in a real place , where i will be able to make good choices , ' i reminded him .
[617/1000]	he looked up in surprise . " she 's not doing well . " " i have n't seen her , " i said . " since the morning the attack in toronto . " " oh
[618/1000]	the silence grew between them , broken only by the distant thunder of rain . ' what ? ' her brother asked . ' nothing . ' ' you just wo n't stop ? ' he sounded
[619/1000]	" you do n't always get what you look for in all the bad things , " he said , his green eyes gleaming dangerously . maybe he was right . maybe i did n't . it just felt
[620/1000]	" it 's okay , baby . " he had to get her away from there . shit . so f * * king f * * king tight . he was thinking about the shower .
[621/1000]	<EOS> i left the gym , got in my car , and drove home <EOS> ... there was something in my gut . some kind of emotion had me on edge . when i got home , however , my
[622/1000]	" i do n't think the captain had anything to do with any of it . he was going on about that war being over , but what the hell . give him some credit , he 's the one
[623/1000]	" not of any importance to me . how about you , emma ? i mean , are you interested in marriage you know ? " brad asked . a warm sensation coursed through emma 's entire body .
[624/1000]	one day a very nice young woman , who seemed eager to please , came to me and told me that she would like to be a model for a tv show we had going to montreal , and to
[625/1000]	" very well . " she frowned . " let 's do it without any unnecessary unnecessary fuss , please . " " certainly , my lady . " he turned to go and turned back once more .
[626/1000]	" the boy does n't die ! " wailed the girl 's mother . " he goes into the night . i can go there now and return ! it 's the only way ! you 'll never see
[627/1000]	she nodded , and moved back over to the window , where a series of small black , white , and pink lights flashed on in the darkness outside . " this is your own house ? " nate
[628/1000]	" go ahead , then , " the captain said , " but do n't leave anything to chance . at first i thought it might be in the hands of whoever tried to kill you . but i think
[629/1000]	" wait , " i said . " have you seen any of the other girls ? " he squinted at me , waiting for me to explain . i told him i did n't get a rise out
[630/1000]	i grabbed the backpack and went back to the house . the whole time i was talking i tried to pull it off with my legs , but my limbs could n't do as well . at the bottom of
[631/1000]	" but why would the people in it want it ? " john asked , trying to keep him calm . he was not very sure about this ; it was not like he had a choice . "
[632/1000]	the man at the door had been a little surprised to see us in the bar at all . he would have been glad to see us go into the party and not run screaming away to another bar .
[633/1000]	" never ! please , please do n't leave me . " " i love you , " she sobbed . " i love you so much . " " i 'm coming back here , now ,
[634/1000]	it was a sign of progress in an otherwise , very low form of progress . i worked on my diary for a while before i noticed that i had not been able to go over the top of
[635/1000]	he had known why he 'd come . all along it had been about sex . he did n't know what it felt like to feel the pressure of another woman 's skin pressing against his skin . to see
[636/1000]	he turned to her , her eyes wide . i 'd give my right arse to be the one to see her mouth fall open . " you do n't need to , " he assured her . "
[637/1000]	but then we 're here because , last week , as a girl , i left the man of my dreams in a cell and he was so excited about this new project you were working on that he practically
[638/1000]	in fact , she wondered about the exact location of the person who had killed her mother while they were hunting julia and a few of the others from the house . had julia killed her own mother ?
[639/1000]	he does n't answer . what was his deal then ? why is he so different now than he is then ? he told me he was n't gay . what does that mean ? why does he want me
[640/1000]	" i 've never heard anything so stupid . " he glanced up at her . " you were n't laughing tonight . for the last one hundred years my coven have kept her prisoner in the human government
[641/1000]	he was shaking his head , smiling softly as he spoke . " did i ever tell you that in three of my stories i told my parents ? " i shake my head and pull the blanket up
[642/1000]	then there was the call from the fbi director at the chicago embassy . " we have a problem , " he said . " some men from the fbi are acting on behalf of an international terrorist group called
[643/1000]	" this is , we 're afraid , " said a second secretary . " it seems a fair guess that we 're dealing with a member of the board that wants to go to the police .... "
[644/1000]	she held her breath , waiting for the inevitable . she listened but heard nothing . * * * " what happened , lexi ? we have n't heard anything from you for three months . and then
[645/1000]	" well , do you wear your hat inside out ? because , " he leans a shoulder against the door frame , " i got a really bad feeling about all this . " i blink at him
[646/1000]	her eyes suddenly widened , and i knew . " oh my god ... you're really here ... with me . " " you know me . i can be so predictable . " " not where tristan
[647/1000]	i turned my attention back to james , who was leaning back on the truck with his arms crossed on his chest . " you 're a real dumbass . it 's too late . i already have it fixed
[648/1000]	" you saw what i did ? " i nod . " is that what - i took a picture ? " i ask as i kneel down to take off my sneakers and socks . " i
[649/1000]	" i see . i am honored that you have been taken on willingly as i am . " " but what is it that you want to know ? " he took a step toward me .
[650/1000]	" i do not feel like it , " the earl replied coolly . " the entire thing revol ves around you , do n't it ? you need to feel better about your abilities , and i want a
[651/1000]	" you do ? " she winked at me , and i was about to ask what the hell that meant , but she continued , " and you looked sad as hell when you saw me crying on
[652/1000]	" see the pictures ? " olivia held them out in his direction . he placed them in his lap and examined them with disinterest . " they 're amazing ! " he ignored my sarcastic tone
[653/1000]	" you are definitely not wearing those in the daytime , " she said . " i do n't see that much skin beneath a t - shirt . " oh , i put them there . for no
[654/1000]	and then i remembered what happened after i left the house . all that i did in the aftermath was go back to the house , lock the door , and go into my bed . no one was watching
[655/1000]	" he sent me , not you . " " what 's his name ? " " tom . i was supposed to meet him at the church . i 'm supposed to use his cell with my
[656/1000]	he stared at her for a moment , the blood drained from his face , and then he said tersely , " she 's a damn witch , is what she is . remember what he said ? "
[657/1000]	" maybe . but i said to myself that you 're not a thief . that 's not what you 're here , right ? " " no , but i 'm looking . " " who am
[658/1000]	" i 've finally got something that will do ... a whole lot more than paint . " that ought to make him happy . " what it is ? " " not my best work , but
[659/1000]	then , if the story continues if you 've enjoyed the kiss because not all of that is it when a new chapter takes place if you want the love of a nice girl forever instead
[660/1000]	" you 're welcome . i 'm taking over teaching . " " and the family business ? " " we 're going to sell it outright . " " what ? " she gasped in surprise
[661/1000]	but , it 's possible ; it may have been a second . " " how could this have happened ? " " the only way anyone could have imagined a blood exchange , and even if he
[662/1000]	chapter 27 the house , or more accurately : the house that had once been rachel 's life in 16 0 2 was now an object of fear that a vampire made of undead blood might come and put
[663/1000]	" no big deal . " it sounds a little bit like her voice , but i ca n't be sure . " you 're not telling me what you 're up to , are you ? i 'm
[664/1000]	and that came in handy as well . he could n't tell her how grateful he was that she was leaving , and that he had n't told her to leave , unless she wanted some time to decide
[665/1000]	" there 's a lot of people up around here getting drunk , and it 's a pretty dangerous place to be , " said his friend brian . " is there a place we can stay ? "
[666/1000]	' oh , thank god ! ' she exclaimed , and drew him into the small den by the window . she sat and turned to go , then paused and turned back . ' i owe you and me
[667/1000]	" just for tonight , " she said . " i 'm not sure when i 'll be home . " the two of them slid out of the booth as a customer came to take her order .
[668/1000]	i could n't help it . i laughed more with a knowing look . " why ca n't i have sex with you , sebastian ? " i 'd finally gotten the answer i wanted . i smiled genuinely when
[669/1000]	" it had been some time since you saw him . i 'm afraid we were n't very friendly when he took the throne , " norian grimaced . " that is , until i sent him a letter informing
[670/1000]	" do you want to stop it ? " " stop what ? " " coming to new york . i ca n't do this anymore . it does n't feel right . " i knew she
[671/1000]	so he 's had time to plan this , to plan the future of his own family , which was exactly what he hoped to achieve when he 'd given his father the business and taken control of the company
[672/1000]	" there are seven other females in the kitchen , " i say , interrupting before he can talk himself out of it . i walk over to the fridge and grab the last of the juice . after
[673/1000]	" you 're insane , " i reply , shaking my head in amusement , and then i lower my hand . " what about the men ? did they see me ? " she asks , giving me
[674/1000]	" we do n't have much time , " says marlene . " the garde have the same idea i have to follow <EOS> for a while . with <EOS> we 'll be halfway to the window at the very
[675/1000]	from the roof , we hear the phone ring , then the sound of footsteps running down the stairs . another minute passes , then a man 's voice calls from as far and wide as our house , "
[676/1000]	both women laughed outright . i felt my own heart pound and my belly tighten - the world around me seemed to tilt , but i knew right now nothing could have prepared me for the relief that was in
[677/1000]	" have you - have you got children ? " she asked . " no , " he said . " i do n't have kids . " " when did you get pregnant ? " she asked
[678/1000]	" what we 're seeing here is a simulation of an event event that occurred just a few hours ago . " " now , " i said , waiting for him to elaborate about what just happened .
[679/1000]	" you know how angry his parents are . we 've never seen them before . " " who even knew it was you ? " " i did . i told her we were only taking you
[680/1000]	not long ago , his world had been his only source of happiness ... and that was no longer . when he stepped out of the shower , he did n't feel very beautiful . but at least for
[681/1000]	" you 're on ! " he said , and it was the first time i 'd heard him actually sound enthused . " now tell me what happened . " " you saw him ? " i gestured
[682/1000]	it was three weeks before the start of second 's . despite all the reasons , he found himself looking forward to it . it was n't as if it was about the sex ; it was about getting
[683/1000]	" you were n't at your apartment all day , " zane asked . no , he had n't been ; ty had taken off without telling him . and if he had , would ty still be here ?
[684/1000]	i shrugged . " there was lots . " " there was , but did you keep me up all night worrying about it ? " his brows came together in thought and it took everything i had not
[685/1000]	i nodded dumbly , and saw her make a move towards the door . before she could even hit the handle , i pressed down on her hand on the small of her back . " i have n't told
[686/1000]	" it 's not something you 're ever going to discuss , " mr. ra ith said . " what do you mean ? " i asked . " you have n't been in contact with her for
[687/1000]	he heard his grandfather 's voice echo once more in his mind . but it was fading . it would never come back again - at last a thin , weak voice joined it , drawing him back
[688/1000]	" ah , how silly of me to think you heard just because your father was gone , " said the fairy . she laughed at her own absurdity . " i 'll bet he can hear your heart pumping
[689/1000]	" do n't be so bloody mad . i 'm not stupid . that was the other two guys who got attacked by the car , " i lied , trying to convince her that it had n't been .
[690/1000]	he 'd spent the last day , after dropping me off not one phone call , but forty - eight hours earlier , driving home from jfk . the first time i 'd ever been to a funeral , i
[691/1000]	" no , i do n't think so , " she said . " but i 'm sure i 'll see you again . " " i would n't miss it . " he leaned down for one more
[692/1000]	" no , but the men in the building are now going to make a lot more noise in the morning . think - oh , we 're not being heard . it 's not a full moon - not
[693/1000]	" that 's enough ! " mark fired his pistol . " now get down on your hands and knees ! " the people who were at the door stopped chanting . " it 's just us !
[694/1000]	my arm twitched . " now , " he whispered . " i wish you 'd been with me the last time , but - " " you owe me this , do n't you ? " i
[695/1000]	" it 's always here with you . i 've always been here . but do n't worry , you 're not alone . as for me , i ca n't wait to meet you . " that last
[696/1000]	which makes sense , since you do n't make friends with them either . of course , the only two people i 've wanted in my life have been my mother and grandmother and my brother . the people i
[697/1000]	i do n't want to hear any more about this . i try not to dwell on his loss , but i ca n't stop that thoughts from filtering through my mind and causing me to push the couch aside
[698/1000]	she leaned forward , looking him dead in the eye . " i want to try and find out what 's going on . what made you change a bit in the short time we 've known each other
[699/1000]	he felt the tug of the blade first one way before he felt the blade go in . it was n't the knife he had before , but then again , he had n't needed it . this was his
[700/1000]	the next afternoon , emily and emily were in the same class , and for the tenth time , emily pointed at a picture she 'd found in her old dresser drawer - one of ali , ian , and
[701/1000]	" we have to talk , " he said . " <EOS> , go . " " do n't care if you 're an actress . who is he shooting ? i ca n't be your sister - "
[702/1000]	and then she said , " can you come in ? i just saw your friend from this morning come out . " he 'd forgotten about her . did she know he 'd been watching her ? probably
[703/1000]	" if the truth be told , that 's too bad . " i did n't say a single word to her about the girl 's body . instead i did the only thing i could do ; i shrugged
[704/1000]	i want this for you . i understand that you need your mom . i can help you get your mother back . everything will get back to good . we will make our way out of this , sweetie
[705/1000]	" yes , but there are others who want you dead . it will only last once you are gone . " " but i am dead . " " the master will not know that yet ,
[706/1000]	" this is a surprise . " she turned to him and smiled her genuine smile . " i never doubted that you 'd come ! " " i did n't think i needed to . "
[707/1000]	do you hate me ? the question hung in the air between us . in spite of everything , i could n't stop the smile . it shot from me and i felt like i could run up
[708/1000]	" that was fast , " he said . " any idea why ? " " i 'm a cop , " she said . " the best i can figure - it was the only call we got
[709/1000]	' that you only came to me because it was the most logical thing to do and not because i 'm being daft , ' she said with an arch look . ' i did n't say that ,
[710/1000]	" that 's very kind of you , reverend . it 's been wonderful . " " well , i 'm afraid i have some bad news for you . " her voice held the words of a grave
[711/1000]	he could n't stop himself any longer . his fingers slid down her spine , searching for the hem of the tank top she wore . she shivered under his touch , but he did n't need to touch her
[712/1000]	" i wonder if i will ever get over this , " she murmurs . i smile . she 'll never get over this . never . we 're going to make a fortune and have millions and start
[713/1000]	" they 'll be back any time , " i announced . her hand drifted to the handle of the door . " so that 's it ? " she asked . " yep . not a problem
[714/1000]	or did i really ? i was n't . i 'd done the right thing by her . seeing her , talking to her , for lunch , i realized it was as smart of a decision as
[715/1000]	he raised the paddle to strike . she slid out of a crouch and caught his wrist , stopping him . in the silence , she watched his other hand , gripping the paddle as if as a steel
[716/1000]	i sat in the corner and got something out for the both of us . i was careful not to touch it in case the glass dripped on the floor or spilled their contents . i could hear the glass
[717/1000]	" it 's not this planet anymore , sir , " jason says . " but it 's going to be a good one . " " who are they , boy ? " " people like us
[718/1000]	" no thanks . it 's mine now . " " what about that ? " the woman said , nodding toward the gold ring i wore . " my husband gave me this . i was wondering
[719/1000]	" no problem at all . " i could feel his gaze on me , as well as feel the heat from his body seeping into mine . he must have read my expression , because he went to
[720/1000]	she was n't going to complain about the accommodations . " yes , ma'am . " i started to ask her why he was leaving him , but she lifted him off the floor and said , "
[721/1000]	he rubbed his hand down his face , then down the front of his pants , rubbing his jaw as if to smooth the stubble there , but it was no use . if things were n't better with rachel
[722/1000]	" it can not be helped , i suspect . we all must die sooner or later , even for the greater good , but a child must die first and that 's the way such things go . "
[723/1000]	" you two tell them both their balls have stopped flapping , " grace ordered . " and what ? " the taller man teased . " what do you care ? " grace snapped , sounding absolutely
[724/1000]	" i 'm sure she is . " " we are right back to square one , " he said . " you ca n't win her back . " he turned around and started back up the
[725/1000]	" hey , " said miles as he suddenly noticed some sort of movement in the alley with the occasional twitch of an eye . although he could n't easily understand what was happening , he thought he detected something
[726/1000]	" okay , what happened ? " " i got caught up in the moment . " he did n't elaborate . " apparently i said something bad to a stranger i met . " he stood , folding
[727/1000]	* * * beth was awake early , before dawn , though she was n't sure what time it was . most of her family was , obviously , up at their little hotel . well , most of
[728/1000]	" i 've been seeing that guy for a while now - the one who showed up in the shop to see if i wanted him to get a job , though . " " you must be shitting
[729/1000]	" but i think i 'll be coming after him anyway , " said justin , and the two continued down the path , laughing and joking . the run a 's government center was quiet , and hansen
[730/1000]	" do whatever you have to do to get out , " she whispered . " they have no way to know i 'm alive yet and they do n't need me . there ca n't be anyone else coming
[731/1000]	i nodded , slowly . this was n't happening . i had to find rachel . now . trent , no wonder trent was upset . there was no one to talk to about this . " i
[732/1000]	" not so much all of it , " i said . " not all of it . i remember the world as i know it , i know everything that happened there . even the most ordinary of things
[733/1000]	" he was so careful to not bring their attention to us , " sarah responded . a sense of awe and happiness invaded alice 's heart . she wanted to say that everything she heard was true but
[734/1000]	" why do n't you stop being so damned melodramatic and start being honest with me ? " he stared out his window and i felt a quick shock to my stomach . did he really think the way
[735/1000]	" my life had a lot of strange twists and turns . " he 'd gotten so tired of women insinuating that he could not commit himself to anyone before he returned home , that it 'd been a good
[736/1000]	alex and the bartender were just getting started , the second dance had begun . " alright , if you 're sure you 're ready , i 'll go first , " alex said sheepishly as she held her
[737/1000]	it was n't fair , he told himself . it did n't matter how many times he 'd told her to get in the car , or as often as she 'd been in the shop , or if any
[738/1000]	no you wo n't ! " you wo n't , " i said . " like hell i wo n't . leave it at that . " he backed away from cole . " for once , shut
[739/1000]	" i 've watched my own dad as long as i can remember . besides , if a guy 's a pretty boy , that 's bad news if you 're not a guy , " he added as an
[740/1000]	" so you wanna go on a date ? " " no thank you . " " why not ? " " i 'm going to go to a movie with my friend . then dinner at
[741/1000]	" my son , you 're killing him ! we have no time for this ! i do n't know how long this will take , so i need to hurry . " his voice was low and urgent .
[742/1000]	" oh dear , " lily said . " we 're not on good terms today . " rose did n't want to be the cause for a rift . " what do you mean , you are
[743/1000]	" i 'm sorry , sir , he 'd never say that , " said the clerk , peering at the list . " <EOS> , " said , ' he 'd tell me , one month . "
[744/1000]	" tell me which way to go , " i told him over the rumbling of the jeep 's engine . " i do n't know yet . " he turned his head and looked over , his expression
[745/1000]	" if she thinks i lied , " john said , " then she 'll believe anything . " " that 's kind of you , " helen said . " i do n't understand how our daughter can
[746/1000]	and that 's how i became a vampire . even without my blood , i had a powerful mother . there were no secrets about mom and me , but she was strict , and i felt that way about
[747/1000]	i heard laughter and shouts as the girls and i walked to the fence , and turned to smile at them . they were standing there holding their own , and they looked at me like i was going to

[750/1000]	" he sure did , " she said . " did he ever say he was glad to see you ? " " he did . " " good . " there was a knock on the
[751/1000]	" let me hear the sound of your voice , " he said , feeling as if he was doing something wrong . she chuckled . " it 's a little bit loud , that 's all . please
[752/1000]	i thought she 'd go into tears , but she took off like a rocket . well , that was n't bad , if you ignored the fact that even in his state his ass was running around . if
[753/1000]	i did n't say anything . i just watched her pace while looking around the room . her shoulders sank as she took in the small apartment . " they 're going to kill me here . i do
[754/1000]	the smile she offers me is so sad that i just want to wrap my arms around her and comfort her on that awful moment she lost before mine did . " i could n't bear to be the
[755/1000]	" maybe you 'll want to give him up , " she suggests . " maybe you should just forget he ever existed and you wo n't have to see me anymore . " " no , i have
[756/1000]	and if that is n't a clue , i do n't know what is . but i hear it . the scream of a woman . the scream of a woman lost . and the sound of
[757/1000]	" is this why you had to have the ring ? " " yes . " i said . " i am afraid that i can not reveal all . " " why are you telling me all
[758/1000]	" i 'll just go wait for him in my car , " she said as she ran out the front door . i smiled , walked back to my car , and grabbed my phone from my pocket
[759/1000]	" then do it . " " no , you listen to me . i have to do this thing for my family . look at what your dad 's willing to sacrifice for me . i need that
[760/1000]	he shook his head . " no . not like that . i am taking you in further , for a couple more days . " " only if you promise to take good care of me . "
[761/1000]	" what is it ? you 've been quiet . " there was fear in her voice as well as panic . he did his best to erase the fear . " something is going on . if i
[762/1000]	" there are two of us ! " i barked at our guards . " you ca n't try and protect yourself ! " i pulled back and i really intended to get in a few good kicks at them
[763/1000]	' have you forgotten ? ' said keith . ' i did n't forget , keith , but i do n't ... ' keith stepped . william stepped away . ' sorry , ' he said . '
[764/1000]	her eyes met his and she knew she was in trouble . when she looked back at her daughter , she added gently , " and daddy will love you better if you give up your world to be
[765/1000]	" will i ever live the same way i was then ? the same expectations for my life ? " " yes . " " when was the last time you touched me ? " he hesitated
[766/1000]	he began to tremble . " are you sure ? because i like spending a lot of time in this cage . " " no . yes . no . " " then why would i be so
[767/1000]	but it was easy ; he was so hungry that he did n't bother to turn his head . he could hear the slow crawl of spiders in the darkness and the scrape of claws on the rocks above .
[768/1000]	" i ca n't believe you did this , " michael said as he came up to us . " i 'll be serious . i know that 's a terrible thing to do , but it would be easy
[769/1000]	" if it 's good enough , then it 's good enough . " she looks back at me again , her eyes glowing . " so , <EOS> just give it a try , okay ? " she asks
[770/1000]	" but it 's so much worse . " his eyes took on an agonized look . " it 's like he 's never been here at all . " " where are you ? " she asked .
[771/1000]	" i love you , " she whispered . " i love you , too . but we do n't have to hang out there . it 's not safe out there and we 're in public and i
[772/1000]	" well , we could talk about the wedding . you know , keep all this from everyone . get a bigger head . " " sure , get it done as soon as possible . it 's just
[773/1000]	" the girl . she 's down here , " he yelled . " just look ! " behind the guard 's back , the boy ran out and over to joseph at 's side . he reached out
[774/1000]	" you 're what ? " " i was twenty . " i stare at him . " for three years , i thought you were on your bed with me . then my sister got sick and
[775/1000]	his answer seemed to be a nod , because he let go of her arm and she moved in the direction of the water . she was moving rapidly now , and he fell into step beside her .
[776/1000]	" if it will help , " he said , " go and ask the man . " " i ca n't do that to him , " i said . " i wo n't have it any
[777/1000]	" i had a little experience over at the local police station . i helped the woman who was caught shop lifting . the officer who came forward to talk to her gave her the stuff , so she could
[778/1000]	he smiled , a full , perfect smile . " really ? " " really . " he closed his eyes . he did n't want to go through with that . still holding her gaze , he
[779/1000]	he gave her a little half smile . " if you were in my position , i probably would n't think of it . " " no , the things you say are really good and you can drive
[780/1000]	i did n't wait to be told again that and <EOS> f * * y , being a good girlfriend she had plans . ( she was too smart to take care of all that ) . i was
[781/1000]	" i think i see your face too well , my dearest love . " he said on his way down to his suite . " i have things to find out . " " great . see you
[782/1000]	still , there was the danger . he might be just as dangerous . " i found it , " he said . slowly , she turned her gaze to him . more than a little stunned
[783/1000]	she watched him as he placed the glass in front of her . " make yourself comfortable . i 'll be back . " she watched as he left her alone in the room . getting out of the
[784/1000]	" what did she say ? when she contacted you ? " " she said that she 's looking for something , " he mumbled . " i told her that 's all i know . i did n't
[785/1000]	i was in such a state . i knew some things about the everneath , and i was n't sure i did enough for my new body to survive the drive . i did n't want them to have
[786/1000]	" my sister wants to move out , " he said without warning . my mouth dropped open . his gaze hardened . " that 's not a bad way to talk about your family . " he
[787/1000]	it was a brief embrace , one that encompassed only a brief moment 's physical contact , but was intensely emotional to the participants . they took this in at once , as they now sought to comfort one another
[788/1000]	" yeah , " she said with a nod . " i 'm glad you did . it 's been rough . " he nodded . " it has . " then he bent his head and brushed
[789/1000]	' no trouble . ' said mrs glo d , as she turned and left . ' what kind of trouble ? ' said virginia , a little uneasy at the direction this conversation had seemed to be taking .
[790/1000]	" no ! " chapter 14 on thursday morning , on the beach at the back of the inn , the captain and his new crew found their way to the tiny but clean village , at the
[791/1000]	" the two of you have been quite popular the last few days . do n't ruin it , " i urged weakly . " i 'm not going to ruin it . i just do n't think we
[792/1000]	" i 'm not sure there is . you 're not that kind of woman . " " so who are you that i 've made an enemy ? " " there are two ways to ask that
[793/1000]	i stood on the far side of my room and stared at the room , feeling an odd pang for the girl who would never see it . she had to leave by tonight . right now . it
[794/1000]	" if i stop drinking it will i be coming to visit you again ? " a smirk appeared . " yeah , it might be a little tricky . " she pushed at me with her free
[795/1000]	i gasped loudly . " they could never have known any of that ! " he pulled me closer and kissed me . " they 'll figure it out , " he hissed between his kisses . " they
[796/1000]	" i 'm going to start working on it . " i sighed and sat back down . i turned the couch toward me and took her hand in mine . " you know , something happened with micah
[797/1000]	" no , not tonight that was n't a good idea , so i 'm going to take a cab back . " a cab ... he could n't drive her back to her aunt 's . it 's
[798/1000]	he frowned , a black scowl twisting his features . " not quite as i thought . " " i do n't care . " her hand reached up and covered his beautiful face . " i did
[799/1000]	she let him pull her to her feet . " i wo n't let you , " she said . then , shaking her head , she made a move to step aside , but he would n't let her
[800/1000]	although i had no clue what those words meant , they did n't strike a chord with me . not the slightest . " what 's a pretty girl like you doin' in this place ? " luke asked
[801/1000]	the girl 's eyes grew wide with surprise . " you 're from the university ? " " on my way down , " he answered flatly . " get you something to eat first . " "
[802/1000]	" you said he had n't started to come back yet . what do you guys think ? " i raised my brow at her . " uh , i think it 's that good that he 's been
[803/1000]	the other warrior was a well - muscled young man with an ugly scar lining his left cheek . his gaze roamed the length of the clearing , stopping when he realized his opponent was n't alone . " damn
[804/1000]	to be honest , i think he thought i had him . that 's why i finally asked him when he had said ' hello ' . " come on . say something . " " i do
[805/1000]	' no , it 's worse . it 's worse than we imagined . it 's worse than we expected . ' we returned to the house and were shocked by what we saw . the house seemed to
[806/1000]	" they 're still at that bridge , my man , " joe said , " and this place has plenty of troops there . " i looked out the window again into the night . " this
[807/1000]	her heart jerked as he released the collar around her throat . she swallowed hard as he yanked up her shirt . " oh , god , i want it . " they were standing in the middle of
[808/1000]	her expression was blank as she pushed her plate away . " that would be nice . " he could n't keep his eyes off her pale skin , the way her dark eyelashes fluttered with each word .
[809/1000]	for weeks now , even when things settled down for olivia , max had been an obstacle in his path . her voice was just shy again , though , her fingers tightening in his and then she gave
[810/1000]	now , as she looked at him , the old boy from school would disappear for a few moments . he would think in terms of the past , for the one few weeks he had been in the hospital
[811/1000]	after two days of fighting , the wolves were completely defeated . a couple of wolves had been beaten so badly that the humans now commanded their own . the other two armies attacked the humans the same way .
[812/1000]	we make our way to an older lady sitting on a bench in a white and gray striped umbrella , leaning over the railing of the boardwalk . her blond hair sweeps the blue water in waves . her large
[813/1000]	" okay , fair enough , " she said , sliding into the passenger seat as the bmw whipped into traffic . " where are you taking me ? " she asked , glancing from the mirror to him
[814/1000]	" i see that . you 'd rather work with the zombies . " " i can do this too , i bet . " " you do get around a lot . but you 're not stupid
[815/1000]	" no , the world is a dangerous place , " elend said . " but it 's also useful . " zane raised an eyebrow . " useful ? like what ? " " well , for
[816/1000]	" it 's not fair , " seth said , struggling for words . " the things you 've said to me . " " you 're starting to make me think of the things you wrote back to
[817/1000]	' it 's not the worst thing i did either . i got the bad blood with our dad , and we both knew he would have been really mad at me for not pulling the plug . '
[818/1000]	i smiled at him , but i did n't know what looked right and i wished he would shut up . he turned to look at me . " how many things do you really enjoy to have sex
[819/1000]	he 'd just taken his life with his back to me . i could n't cry . of my life had been forfeit . how could i cry over something when he seemed to be forever at my side ?
[820/1000]	" and i do n't want him to get shot again , " said laura quietly . " but i want him to go to rehab , " said eve . " i have n't had a chance to

[823/1000]	they hurried to meet with her father in the study . " i took the liberty of sending a messenger to my house , " her uncle said . " as soon as my business concluded in london ,
[824/1000]	she gave him a small shrug that said , do n't blow your cover , babe . the thing about your big nose , bud , was that if you were a cop , you could take out anyone who
[825/1000]	if i wanted this girl , and i needed her , i 'd have to be honest . and i did want her - a lot . i had wanted some special permission just from her , and she was
[826/1000]	" that 's the best news i 've had all day . " she kissed his mouth in an attempt to comfort him . he did n't seem to need that gesture , his arms holding her tight .
[827/1000]	she had pulled aside the sheet and stood gazing at herself in the mirror with her skirt pulled up , her hair done up in a neat twist , her back arched and her bare back showing off her bra
[828/1000]	" you , " he said , and grinned . " just you . " " you are so going to pay , you know that , right ? i really hate it when girls say stuff like that

[831/1000]	" come over here with me . " i do as he asks , stepping behind him and wrapping my arms around his waist , my chin gently resting on his shoulder and my cheek covering his heart .
[832/1000]	' i see , ' said lord vetinari . ' how kind , ' said vimes , still watching the sky . ' there 's still so much to learn . ' ' that 's right , ' said
[833/1000]	" i am and am prepared . but you can let your own thoughts make the decisions with this information . " he stepped closer . " i have no intention of letting you and the rest of these people
[834/1000]	" you only live once , ben , " his father assured . " at your age , the first lesson is not to be anxious to learn the first lesson . " " are you kidding with me
[835/1000]	" yes , mr. mercer , i was thinking about that . i 'll write you a check tonight . " " do that , mrs. mercer . " after she hung up , mrs. mercer pushed the
[836/1000]	he placed the paper back down on the table . " you were right about them . i 'm a fool . " " and you have been for a long time . do n't beat yourself up .
[837/1000]	" it 's getting cold out there . " the big black wolf crouched down . " we 'll come back another time , i should think . " " i do n't think so , " she
[838/1000]	<EOS> she could n't argue with the conviction that drew had a lot of information - and she wanted to give it to him . instead of admitting it , though , she said , " let 's just keep
[839/1000]	i try to pull away but he pulls me closer . " do n't . " " why ? you do n't want to be with me , " i say , my voice sounding lost in the hollow
[840/1000]	" he 's coming out tomorrow . " " he 's not coming " " you 'll see . just think how much he 'll look for as a father . " " like who ? his
[841/1000]	" you 're worried , " he said . " why ca n't that scare me up ? " " because the power all down here is down . we can not hear the ocean . we can
[842/1000]	" no , well , i 'm glad to hear you are . but your reputation is not one i 'd use , and i do n't expect you to be able to be a good sister to little anna

[844/1000]	<EOS> it was a very old and very cold , and there seemed to be nothing to say how long many years had passed . he had spent the day behind a screen of brush and in every hour he
[845/1000]	" that 's because i 'm a smart one . " " then you 're as stupid as i 'll have you to be . " " i - " he stopped , looked away from me ,
[846/1000]	" this is all new , " he said , as if the whole thing was no major surprise . " i mean , the man you met at the restaurant said he worked at your house and lived with
[847/1000]	" one would assume ' one would suspect ' that would be you , " she laughed with a real kind of glee . " i 've never been so afraid of anything . " he looked down at
[848/1000]	" that 's the plan , " he says , then turns to my friends . " okay , if you 'll excuse me , i have to catch up with our team . " " what 's going

[850/1000]	the second text message was just minutes after she read it , the one she read three weeks later , when her eyes filled with tears . " who is it ? a girlfriend ? a husband ? "
[851/1000]	my father did n't say anything , but he looked over the front of the car to his mate , taking her in the same way that his son and father never did . i stared at the woman in
[852/1000]	" it 's hard to believe she was about to go on this cruise and be an alien . she 'd have never said she was your sister . " " i thought she still was n't , "
[853/1000]	" did you make any progress ? " i asked my mom , taking a bite of my cheeseburger , realizing that i forgot to eat one of my chicken wings . " of course , dear . i
[854/1000]	" maybe it 's because he does n't want to be with me and his sister . " i took another step away from him , frustrated , and felt my shoulders hunch in resentment . " i have
[855/1000]	i nodded , and i still felt cold . he 'd died because of his own actions . or he 'd felt that way . perhaps he 'd felt that way because of what he 'd seen
[856/1000]	" i have so many questions , " she said under her breath . " i know . " he squeezed her arm and closed his eyes . " and i 'll answer them honestly . i want to
[857/1000]	" and after the fact ? it does n't even cross my mind that you might know . " she blinked up at him to find herself in the same position she 'd been on before , only this
[858/1000]	" do n't bother , " he replied . " you need to think of a way to get over this , " she said . " there 's no escape . " " not unless you
[859/1000]	" yes , " said the woman , " but they had their problems , and now i have mine . " " why did n't they all get away from the prison by now ? " said ydnas
[860/1000]	" ok . i do n't need to go into that . i do n't know , " i answered , trying to keep my voice light in the room . " is he a boy ? " he
[861/1000]	" do n't you just love the smell of your wife 's skin ? " said neville . " who else ca n't smell her ? " neville put his hand over his face . " there ,
[862/1000]	he knew she could n't , not to him . yet he was powerless to tear his gaze off of her , to prevent himself from taking her hard , to thrust inside her wet depths to the hilt ,
[863/1000]	it was strange - no one had said anything for like twenty minutes . what the hell was so big that his team could n't see him ? and why had n't any of them mentioned the ambush ?
[864/1000]	at least she would n't need a babysitter . right now , she was free to let her family in and get to know them , even though she had n't seen them for a couple of weeks .
[865/1000]	" this is the beginning of the end of all our hardships , " galloran mumbled . they all turned to o ster . " no ! " o ster spat , tears brightening his eyes . " like
[866/1000]	" i always hear that after the first shot 's down , everything is at a more or less normal level , " said eddie , sounding both worried and mildly annoyed . roland nodded . " it will
[867/1000]	" i mean i am not really getting involved with your ex - love , well , i mean i guess i was , the guy who could have been with me , could have . " his eyebrows
[868/1000]	" you 're pretty good , " she remarks . i shake my head , thinking it 's a little too early in the evening for a girl to be talking about sex . " yeah , thanks .
[869/1000]	" no , i feel like a ghost , " kate replied . she suddenly looked at him intently , her eyes wide and her face animated . " am i a ghost ? " she asked , and he
[870/1000]	not you . she wants you , not her . " but because she was a healer , she was still damaged damaged . so , could he force her ? " i think i can make you have
[871/1000]	the girl , still on her stomach , had crossed her arms across her chest , a faint expression of fury on her face that i could feel on the inside . i looked away . i hated it when
[872/1000]	" i hope you do n't mind my asking , " i continue , " but why did you tell him no one else would get it ? the fact is , you would never get the right one .
[873/1000]	" the right one , " said steve , almost running after the car . she did n't look back and ran ahead , down the street and up into what was apparently the bank . a few
[874/1000]	then he caught his second breath , heard the lock click , and went inside . they were all standing in the front room . * * * " the only way i 'm leaving this place
[875/1000]	we reach the doors but i 'm stopped in my tracks by the face of a man wearing dark glasses . " get up ! " he says , his voice rough and his eyes stormy . i do
[876/1000]	" my mistake . but she 's wrong , was n't she ? " " who ? " " you were out of my life yesterday . as far as i 'm concerned , you were never my

[878/1000]	" it 's the middle of the night , but if you 're awake you can go to sleep . " " there 's no point . i think my body is going to break and die in three
[879/1000]	" no . i keep forgetting that 's one of the benefits of being a vampire . i always did have a thing for black leather pants . " it was quiet then , because neither of us was
[880/1000]	i know he ca n't , but then he 'd never be able to see the bruises on an innocent so white . i follow him into the house , heading straight for the kitchen , where i find
[881/1000]	he shrugged . " do n't know . maybe you 've been thinking of girls like you , maybe having sex with someone like that means you are n't quite the woman you think you are . but maybe i
[882/1000]	" and what makes you think that just an hour ago ? " " the fact that you 're using and abusing me at the same time . the anger that you have for this night , this last
[883/1000]	he felt her body shake . " no , baby , " he whispered brokenly . " this f * * king is exactly how i feel . " then he went on , his voice thick as he
[884/1000]	" there you are then , we have our most useful one , " she beamed . " thanks to you , the woman who is paying us a reward has just returned from our home on earth . "
[885/1000]	" wow . i thought i 'd never get to this point . " " me too . here , let me try it off . " he gently took her hand and helped her up . she
[886/1000]	" i do n't even know what to tell you . you keep going on like there 's no one else in the world but us , and - " " listen to me , " he said .
[887/1000]	" oh ! come on , we 're only going to be gone for about ten minutes ? " he grabbed her and slammed her against the sofa , staring down as if she were the most irresistible woman in
[888/1000]	they were ready to leave but he could n't go back to his hotel . not yet , and not knowing how this would end . he knew he 'd have a lot of questions and he 'd be
[889/1000]	with a nod , he started toward the door . with a hand pressed to the small of her back , he steered her toward the exit . " thank you . " a faint blush filled her cheeks
[890/1000]	he nodded , but did n't move an inch . it did n't make me want to move . " okay , now , you told me it 's in the morning and i 'll tell you it 's
[891/1000]	i can almost hear our conversation as they talk from inside the tent . " i do n't know what my mother would say to us , " she says , all traces of laughter gone . "
[892/1000]	i think of what the old man said . she told me of a girl who lived on the block in a place called ' little hollow ' ; this is which i was searching for , a girl who
[893/1000]	his words came out in a gasp , like a question . his eyes squeezed shut , and i could tell the pain he was fighting for was eating at his control . my entire body twitched with need
[894/1000]	" there was a time when i 'd have dropped the kid by the store as soon as he was old enough to go , and i knew he could get by . it took some doing , but i
[895/1000]	" thank you , " said joseph , returning her quiet smile after she said hello . " it will be a pleasure to see you here . " the lady and her brother stood off to the side
[896/1000]	" i 'd like to talk to you about something . " " about what ? " " about the case . it 's being handled in maine ; it 's just up and coming . "
[897/1000]	i think i 'm starting to understand her . she 's too quick for me , and if dad is n't up to doing it by the time the sun comes up , she knows it . she 's like
[898/1000]	" sure . you can find 'em if you want . " * * * mike dropped me off <EOS> a block ahead . i looked to the alley behind her . " you know , you

[900/1000]	" are you all right ? " he asked her . her eyebrows fell on a frown . " what is it ? " " i need to tell you something . " he set down his wine
[901/1000]	" it did n't work like i thought it would . " " did it work exactly as you thought it would ? " " no . with all of the things you said to me , and
[902/1000]	this house had a separate barn where my dad kept a dozen horses i knew were needed for the summer . i 'd watched these horses the last year , and it all looked the same . i turned
[903/1000]	the day dragged on without incident , and when dusk arrived , he had just enough time to duck out the back , check his schedule and get back to his car in time for the drive . he was

[906/1000]	" yes ? " i answered , already knowing what she had to say , knowing i was losing ground and needing to pull back . so i did , and she went on , " your other sisters .
[907/1000]	" no need , " his father assured him , then turned his attention to catherine . " it 's nice to have you home , catherine . " " as well as my daughter and me . i
[908/1000]	a shadow moved in the doorway , and claire turned , her heart pounding . one of her two brothers walked into the room and put his hand on ada 's shoulder , gently . " he 's a

[911/1000]	" i knew that when you woke me up from my sleep . " " but i guess you did n't want me waking you up earlier that morning too , did you ? " " i did
[912/1000]	" i can not do this , " he said , his voice shaking . " please do not do this to me or this baby . " " you could 've been seen , " i said soothingly
[913/1000]	he chuckled , a rumble of sound in the darkness . " good night , sweet regan , and happy dreams , " she said before turning over in bed , her heart full and pounding in anticipation .
[914/1000]	" what do you do ? " " i told you i do fine . " " i know you do . " " it 's just a job . i work by the hour for god
[915/1000]	it could only be the second time in over twenty - four hours she 'd had any hope of finding a serial killer . the first abduction had been on a whim - which only intensified the fact that the
[916/1000]	" you like me ? " i asked . he looked at me . " seriously ? " " i think you do . i think <EOS> now you 're more than a man - whore . "
[917/1000]	" yeah . " " you need to get them out of her . " i shook my head . " no , i want to pick them . " nathan snorted . " when would you
[918/1000]	" the only problem is that i have n't read it , " connor said . i did n't disagree , but i was hoping to come across it later . " maybe it 's still in the original .
[919/1000]	" i 'll say this for you , " jack spat . " did i not tell you , no one can tell anyone about me . they think a rat would be better than a rat in the jaws
[920/1000]	" it 's hard to get off you before the bell , " he said when he stopped . " me , too , " she agreed . the front door jingled open and closed as he began
[921/1000]	" you 're one of the few . " " so are you . " he looked at his mug and put it on the bar . " i 'll get you some beer . " " no
[922/1000]	" that 's where you 're wrong , " he said through gritted teeth . " what ? why ? " " because you should learn more from me . " his voice turned sharp , cold .
[923/1000]	the elevator doors dinged and opened to reveal a spacious room with a wooden table and chairs . " all the apartments on this floor are equipped directly with the software for the whole building , " he told
[924/1000]	the sound of feet hurried across the floor ; someone was outside the door . " we 've arrived , " silk spoke in a low voice to the guardsman . the guardsman looked a bit surprised .
[925/1000]	" are you sure you do n't want me to come ? " if this goes well , " she whispered . " i was too wrapped up in you anyway . " " sure , baby ,
[926/1000]	" uh , yeah , i get it . " " okay . and at least one of those can have some kind of good sense , do n't you think ? like what our neighbors are saying ?
[927/1000]	" let 's keep the horses in the stable , then , " said ezio . he needed to get word to the assassins that cesare had been captured and the group would be back to plan by nightfall in
[928/1000]	" sorry . " " no need to apologize . honestly , it 's nice thinking about him , and about what might have been . " " i guess . " her chin jerked up defensively .
[929/1000]	" if i did n't know better , " i said , " i 'd say you were trying to pretend that this was n't happening . " she smiled , a huge wet - toothed smile that showed
[930/1000]	" you are an enigma , " his grandmother pronounced , " and most people have no sense of the word . it is the opposite in many ways . i 've always found you capable , and still do
[931/1000]	" what part ? " if he did n't know better , he 'd swear the big guy was blushing . " the part where we both said we did n't know who we really were . "
[932/1000]	she smiled , then reached inside her purse and pulled out the gun she 'd used when working the safe . the one john had given her seven years ago after he 'd taken her virginity . it was much
[933/1000]	" what happened ? " " first , we had to get mr. bo deen . he could n't go . " " so what happened ? " " he got up and went out the back
[934/1000]	" do not worry , " he told kate . " that man has your best interests at heart . we 'll find you a good doctor to look after you and your daughter . " " i 've
[935/1000]	" no , " she sobbed , " no , he does n't . " " so he 's your daddy now , then ? " anna asked her , her voice betraying her feelings . " no
[936/1000]	" i 'm sorry . but you ca n't give it to me . i ca n't . " he looked up at me , then down at the box of tissues . " do i have to buy
[937/1000]	if she did , she would n't be looking for him , at least not to mention to the other men she knew he may want to hear about the trip ahead . " yes . i want it to
[938/1000]	his heart beat rapidly . he wanted her to feel his pain . he wanted her to know that he felt sorry for himself . she stared into his face . her eyes were wet . " it
[939/1000]	his lips tugged into a small , satisfied smile . " i guess for my new ' lady ' to be your new pet , i will give her the treat of my choosing . " with that ,
[940/1000]	' i 'm not going with you . i 'm staying behind . ' ' you can get on the plane . i 'm going in . ' i felt my heart rate dropping . ' it 's not
[941/1000]	we had a good laugh about that , his reaction to that , his reaction for which i would like to repay him , that is , if it was just a few months . after we finished up
[942/1000]	" i 'll make you coffee . " " you 've never done it before ? " " no . " " okay . i 'll be right back . " she smiled and kissed me full on the mouth
[943/1000]	" she had an excellent evening . " ethan 's face was still pale due to the fact you could n't look on his face right now , but his eyes sparkled with amusement . " do n't start talking
[944/1000]	jack was too tired even to respond . he closed his eyes and was glad he had decided not to argue with mary . her hand touched the nape of his neck in a moment of silent communion . he
[945/1000]	" what ? " i asked . i was taken back . " we 've all met . the colonel and the marshal have met , and you 're gon na be our contact here at the academy .
[946/1000]	but it 's pretty easy to spot - when i ca n't see any trace of them . when i make it through the room where they have taken kassie , i see a woman . i step quickly when
[947/1000]	" it 's okay , i realize you 're upset . i 'm sorry i brought up how you feel about marriage and marriage . " he sighed . " yes , but there 's more and you ca
[948/1000]	i was going to explain myself . " if you must know , you 're in my bedroom looking for the missing knife of my youth , " he said coldly , his voice edged with impatience .
[949/1000]	i did n't know what to say . in response , he moved to where the door was hanging open to reveal that it was a small entrance . standing in the doorway , he looked like someone who 'd
[950/1000]	" oh my god . " " what ? " " i think i broke a fingernail . " " well , you could get in trouble . " " why ? did you hit yourself
[951/1000]	it took him an hour to get home , which seemed like forever . normally , he would have left by now , but he had other things to do . he closed the door just as something seemed
[952/1000]	" i was able to kill and cripple two demon - winged angels . " " i do n't believe it . " uriel grimaced . " no one grows horns and spikes like you should . "
[953/1000]	" he 's right , " i said . " you are . " " me ? " she raised her eyes to mine , and there was a genuine surprise in the glint that shone in them .
[954/1000]	" how many more minutes ? " i shouted . she took all of them all at once , screaming with delight the whole time . " fuck ! i love it ! " she exclaimed and pushed
[955/1000]	" you were going to come talk him out of it , " i reminded him . " so ? " " i 'm going to take him to the airport with me . " i heard
[956/1000]	' he should be in england by now , like you said , and i promise in a couple of days . do n't you just feel like getting back to me and making us both your best friends again
[957/1000]	even with my face pressed into the headrest , i felt his tongue enter my mouth . i could hear the low rumble of his voice through my ipod speakers , my lips pressing against his , driving him crazy
[958/1000]	" i think he might be the only person i know who can find out the answers i need . " " let me see if i have this straight , " she mused , leaning back and taking
[959/1000]	the girl shook her head slowly at my revelation . " i 'm the only one he keeps around for his friends and girlfriends . " an exaggerated scowl crossed her pouty lips . " i 'm actually a witch
[960/1000]	what a crazy thing to have said to a guy , he thought . but the truth was so different . of course , it was n't the truth , but he should n't have said it . he made
[961/1000]	" fuck me , olivia , f * * k me , " i cursed , turning my face to the window and seeing a stream of sunlight stream through the branches of trees and up through the trees towards
[962/1000]	" you ca n't be that oblivious ! " i exclaim . " because you 're a horrible kisser ? " he teases , but i scowl and bite my lip to stop my laughter . " stop
[963/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " she said . " i got caught when my foster dad knocked on the door . i never told you , but he was my dad . he was the reason i was in
[964/1000]	" it 's your hair , " mark says as he stands in front of me looking at my hair . " what ? " " just look at it . it 's amazing . "
[965/1000]	that may or may not be the case , but what does that matter ? he has been killed already . i do n't care what you called . just look for survivors . " they were all there
[966/1000]	suddenly he pulled the keys from the ignition . " let 's get the hell out of the area before the mob from the club re gains their faith and begins doing something terrible . " ally hesitated but
[967/1000]	you 're not getting it , <EOS> it just wo n't work . even if you got a pair , they could all be your . i wo n't let you have them . just like i wo n't let
[968/1000]	oh . he 'd been with her in the basement of the cemetery , doing his best to protect her from the consequences . but then , the man whose phone she 'd accidentally hit had been lying dead
[969/1000]	the group walked over to the table and looked down at the books which were stacked on chairs to their left . " those are the books on spells , " liam said . " a good wizard knows
[970/1000]	" thanks for a glass of wine , " she said . " that wo n't be necessary . if you leave now , i 'll be alone with me . " she studied his face , his
[971/1000]	" do you know how that sounds ? " he laughed . " it sounds just like the king . he 's the bastard with all ties to our species . the son of king solomon , all the kings
[972/1000]	" me . " " then you 'll get fired ! " " and it 's not like you 've never done it before , " nick mumbled , still watching her like a hawk . "
[973/1000]	" why did you ever marry her ? " his mouth grazed the top of her ear . " she wanted it . she gave me everything . " she looked down at the sheet . " i 'd
[974/1000]	she turned her back to him and slipped on a pair of jeans . she pulled on a white t - shirt . " you 're not , " jason said , watching her . she nodded .
[975/1000]	" not yet , but i 'm sure it will be soon enough . " " do we know who these guys are ? " " not yet . " " they looked like they 'd been
[976/1000]	" you looked different that day . i thought you were leaving me . " she looked down at me . " that 's it entirely . you 've tried to control me since then , but nothing has
[977/1000]	" she did n't , " reacher said . " i 'm thinking she was dead when it happened . " " how do you know ? " deer field asked . reacher paused and said nothing .
[978/1000]	the house was dark and silent and dark around us . i heard the dog 's footsteps and the rattling of dishes in the sink and the music from the tv downstairs . on a hunch , i put the
[979/1000]	finally , he stops inside of me , and i feel my body 's spasms with shock and pleasure . my breaths come in rapid , harsh gasps as i feel him pull out of me . "
[980/1000]	he was so lost in thought that he could n't even have registered what it was , only that he opened the door to the kitchen . standing in its bright glow , he stared at his dad and saw
[981/1000]	her knees buckled and he caught her tight enough to keep her from falling . " why the panic ? " " so you wo n't find out the truth . " " but ... but ...
[982/1000]	" what is wrong with me ? " she screamed . " why is n't this happening to me ? " i tried so hard to prevent such turmoil from erupting around my own mind , but i was
[983/1000]	" i know . " she sighed . " look , i should be the one apologizing . i was n't trying to sabotage any of it to get to him . there was just nothing i could do .
[984/1000]	" oh , " she replied . " okay . okay . " she looked about like she wanted to be anywhere else in the kitchen , yet she seemed quite relaxed all of a sudden . for an instant
[985/1000]	" because , " i say softly , " you have feelings for me that you just ca n't admit to yourself . " " you 'll tell me that soon , i hope ? " he smiles .
[986/1000]	" i think we should tell her he 's dead , " adam said . " uh , thanks ? " " no problem . " adam walked to the exit and waited for sarah to join
[987/1000]	" yes . that would be wonderful . " for a moment she pondered what to tell them . and then , " i can tell you something . " " what ? " " i ca
[988/1000]	he shook his head slowly . " you do n't seem to have the temperament for these sort of calls ; one has to be patient , i suppose , or we look for any kind of compromise you are
[989/1000]	everyone looks at me like i 've lost my mind when i realize that is what everyone else assumes the worst of me . they know i 'm about to go through the divorce process . i 'm
[990/1000]	" you 're not crazy . maybe , " he chuckled , lifting another plate from the cupboard . " but i 'm really a brilliant guy . " * * * it was almost two before i
[991/1000]	" did you know , " she started , knowing now , " that he does n't want me ? " " what ? " i asked again . " he would n't talk about it to me
[992/1000]	his lips compressed . something i could n't see reflected in his eyes . " yes and no , i think it 's a lot like a case of a mistake . you 'll eventually be left behind if we

[996/1000]	" i 'll be fine , " i said , but did n't say any more . there 'd be plenty of time for explanations later , when i had more information . " what about your men ? "
[997/1000]	i closed my eyes , tears burning my nose . " i ca n't answer that . " " she 's still living with you , you think she 'll ever call or try to contact you now ?
[998/1000]	" there were many , " i pointed out . " not the way you think , " he said , but i could tell he was laughing . " the way i remember my first vampire is
