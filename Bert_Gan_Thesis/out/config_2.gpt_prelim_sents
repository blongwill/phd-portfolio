[8/1000]	with a light slap of his hand , he yanked me to my feet just as some of the wolves scattered . " run , cammie , run , " he said and i did . the wolf growled and
[9/1000]	i do n't know if i 'd ever see that part of him again . " you still love it , do n't you ? " mom asks me quietly . " i have no idea , "
[10/1000]	" it 's coming ! " she yelped . " your father and i love each other very much , and we 'll be in touch if we need anything . " " dad - " she began
[11/1000]	the demon 's head snapped up like a whip . " would you like someone to explain that to you , witch ? " " no . i 'd like you to understand something , and my voice will
[12/1000]	" that 's a lot of pills , " i say , setting the bottles down on the tray . " well , that 's good . i want you to take as many as you can without stopping
[13/1000]	his head dipped lower . " like what ? " " well , " i admitted , and he pushed himself up and my palms , but only for a second , the touch was gone . the air
[14/1000]	the two men met and embraced , his back to the wall and my back to his chest . he spoke softly as he moved his hands up and down and my body tightened . " do n't think
[15/1000]	my hands curled into fists as i attempted to think of a way i could stop this from happening . i remembered that my best friend and best friend ran with the football team , but at least my best

[17/1000]	he knew the score . nothing like a little knowledge and a little money to make up for a lifetime of loneliness . he would have found her in a heartbeat . ' i 'm not wearing a gun

[20/1000]	" the one that lives near you for like ten years <EOS> ... never really had a dad . " " but - " " well , then what you 're thinking about when your dad died ,
[21/1000]	i tried to think of something intelligent to say , something that would make any of this better . nothing worked . " sorry to hear it . " " it 's all right , " she said ,
[22/1000]	' the way he 'd stare at you . the way he said " she " as if she was so close she could touch him . do you think he said something to you ? ' ' i
[23/1000]	after i finished lunch , i sat in the library for a few hours , reading them at my desk . just a few days was enough to create a family , but there was so much to learn .
[24/1000]	" so you 've mentioned me , and i 'm pleased . this is amazing . do you think i can do it ? " " you just might . " " i have to work in the
[25/1000]	" let 's just say that i enjoy eating . " and you , sir . at least in most cases . as if reading his mind , he arched his eyebrows , a charming grin tugging at his
[26/1000]	" can you help me out here ? i 'm a big girl . i can take care of myself . " " okay , but if you have too much fun , come find me . do n't
[27/1000]	" if everyone can agree to these terms without taking away property , and we agree to your terms . " they all nodded . " so who will be taking possession ? " " no one
[28/1000]	" go on , get in there . " " hey , " i complained , " you 're a dick . get in here with your big friend . " " you have another friend ? "
[29/1000]	" no . " i shook my head in disbelief . " you could never go anywhere without a leash or leash . " he laughed with me , as he always did when we shared a joke with
[30/1000]	' i 'd be so happy if i could turn around on stage and kiss you , love . you know , in the studio . ' ' really ? ' ' yeah , ' she giggled ,
[31/1000]	" and , of course , the whole world : the other leaders , the people . they are the rulers of what is called the world ; we are not . we are merely a group of people .
[32/1000]	" no , you never do . " she laughs in a low voice , like we 're having a private joke . " you can go home . " did i miss that little ' i 've never
[33/1000]	i shake my head , and he drops his head to the back of my neck . " please hurry . " but this is n't a game - no , this is a reality check , and i
[34/1000]	well , you 'd be so surprised , then , would n't you , doc ? she touched his face , and his heart beat even faster under her gentle touch . his eyes burned into hers . he
[35/1000]	" you are at least three hundred , " the captain said . they walked into the main section of the ship and looked around . " ca n't possibly have come up in your rank that much . but
[36/1000]	" i 've been following her ever since she was a little girl . she 's been looking for ways to get under his skin . she is the one who killed , and he was the one who killed
[37/1000]	her eyes are wide , and she 's staring at me like she sees a monster inside me . " sorry , " she says . " you were saying something about you liking to eat for breakfast .
[38/1000]	" that was fun " , i continued lightly , " but i do have to ask you to go . i think i need some alone time and a game of cards . " i started for the
[39/1000]	" here we go , " hunter said , leaning back as he took a drink of water . " this would have happened only a few days ago . you have your plane tickets and tickets , and you
[40/1000]	" i would n't ask to be just another victim of this kind of man , " he muttered . a few moments later , the ambulance arrived in the parking lot . he 'd forgotten how strange
[41/1000]	" actually , i 'm sorry you do n't . i 've made a mess of my life in my last few weeks . if i ca n't apologize to my husband for something - namely my death , which
[42/1000]	" are you looking forward to the party ? " she asks when we reach my car . " hardly . " she grins . " well , i do . ca n't wait . " i
[43/1000]	i let out a breath . " i do n't think we can . " " i have n't been a hundred percent honest with you , harper . i 've told you , i ca n't stop loving
[44/1000]	i said , ' you want the last syllable or no ? ' his gaze was a fiery challenge , hot at my suggestion too . it almost sent my heart into spasms with its steady , almost maniacal
[45/1000]	he found himself missing the way she stood near the other side of the table , eyes closed as if she were already asleep , her finger holding the base of her glass like a compass points it 's path
[46/1000]	" right , " he muttered . " thanks . " he turned to go before she could answer . " it was nice talking to you , sam . i hope you do n't mind if i 'm up
[47/1000]	" we 're going to the theater for the concert . let 's see what everyone 's up to . " he walks me to a booth in the back with the lights flashing , and then heads to the
[48/1000]	" i am not interested in getting involved in this . " " i have n't said you would . " " are you about to change your mind ? " " perhaps . not exactly .
[49/1000]	" i do n't think she 's capable of it . but ... i do n't ever want her to come back here . you would n't like the people here , anyway . " she would n't like
[50/1000]	" i 'll go to him , " said wanda . " if <EOS> probably his name is james or harold . just in case . " " wait a minute , sweetie , " warned wanda . the
[51/1000]	" nothing . " " i do n't have a problem with it either . " she ran her hands through her hair . " and i would never ask you to do that . " " but
[52/1000]	to the left , like an owl 's eyes , a dark shadow had seeped from the shadows . he could see it clearly now ; there was no mistaking it . " oh , thank god , "
[53/1000]	he stood , shaking his head . " no , " she said . " i am not going back . you can keep that . " " what 's this ? you 're not going back ?
[54/1000]	he was lying in bed and he was shirtless . he felt a spike of discomfort but after a brief flash of recollection he shook it off and started to turn out the lights . " you got
[55/1000]	the answer was simple . but , no matter how hard he tried , shane could n't get through to shane . there was an odd feeling sitting in shane 's gut . it was like cold water had
[56/1000]	david finally asked , " you sure this wo n't force you to sign out ? " i said to robert , " you do n't have to sign anything out , just let me go shopping . besides
[57/1000]	" you 're okay , " jason said , hugging her . " they 'll come back . they 'll figure this out and come back . " " yeah , they will . " she kissed his head
[58/1000]	" i 'm really afraid , " she said very low . " do i need your permission to break in ? " some of the fear left sam 's face . " no . i want you
[59/1000]	he was there and he did it . " now if you 'll excuse me , i have plans . " he said no more . she closed the door and walked to the other end of the hallway and
[60/1000]	she was dressed in her favourite cream , pencil skirt , pink blouse , top and coat , her hair pulled back in a bun on top of her head , her ankles in a high heeled , black leather
[61/1000]	" yes . " the two of them turned toward the restaurant and then toward the parking lot . " who are they ? " karen finally asked . " it 's hard to say . i
[62/1000]	and just like that , she stopped . " well , " said mr. marlin to lily as he stood at her elbow , looking almost apologetic . " if it 's really any consolation , mr. johnson was
[63/1000]	" sure , " i reply hesitantly . i 'm sure i do n't understand him . he looks me right in the eye and i can tell he knows something i do n't know . i 'm standing here
[64/1000]	his voice had a nervous note . " but i 've never had anyone like you in my life . have you ? " his words did n't take the sting out of my words . did she
[65/1000]	the first lady looked up as one of her servants entered . " my lady , i have received word from lord sk adi , sir ha il gard has sent for her . " " what happened to
[66/1000]	" i 'm fine . just a little ... hungry . " he nodded , and his eyes glinted mischievously . " <EOS> - is something i see you doing ? " i smiled . i had run
[67/1000]	tom gave a satisfied nod . ' maybe i 'm feeling just a little out of control now that i know you 're here and can easily take care of yourself . maybe i ought to give this one a
[68/1000]	" yeah . " " you got it . " * * * after a while , hanna 's phone buzzed with a new text message from brody asking what was happening . he also texted ,
[69/1000]	" i hate you . " * * * * * * beth 's mouth was stuffed full but she could n't stop . " my mom ! " beth did n't even have time to look
[70/1000]	at last she pulled back , searching his eyes . " how can you be so certain that that happened and i 'm not right ? <EOS> ... so many times ? " he shook his head . "
[71/1000]	he did n't answer her , instead setting her down on his bed and taking off his jacket . in the dim light from the two oil lamps , he looked like a golden god - his eyes dark and
[72/1000]	" i never want to see your ass . " chapter seventeen with her heart pounding , ari stepped out of the tub and jumped out before the water cooled down . was that ... ohmy god
[73/1000]	" i did n't mean for him to get any of this . " he reached and grabbed the pouch , opening it and holding it out for everyone to see . " it 's beautiful , " i
[74/1000]	" hello ? " i said . " what do you mean , yes i 'm here , " i heard a female voice say over my earpiece . i just needed to answer the phone . anything to
[75/1000]	" you should go , " she told him . he nodded and stood , running a hand through his hair . " you have your money , right ? " " yes , and you 'll live
[76/1000]	" i will think of you and cherish you forever . " the second verse ends , and i give her a soft kiss on the cheek . i stand back and pull out the bottle of wine and
[77/1000]	" that you knew she 'd try to do . you were sure she 'd screw us . " " i figured as much . " i stood still , then leaned forward again and took away that
[78/1000]	" yeah , i 'm glad you did , " i whispered . there was something freeing about him giving me money - every f * * king dollar . " how long is the wait ? " "
[79/1000]	" that 's right . i 've been having a lot of nightmares lately . " " okay . now , go get in the bathroom and go into the shower . " he turned away and went
[80/1000]	" no ! no , you ... " " then we 'll be friends , " daniel said . " just do n't forget i love you . " " i 'd hope not , " she snapped
[81/1000]	the men stood again as the guards approached . they were a black military . there was barely an inch of room between them . their faces were gaunt and the hair on the back of their necks was unkempt
[82/1000]	" you were in the field - what were you doing ? " asked mrs. harris . " being on a hunch , " he said and flashed her a smile . " about to check what 's left
[83/1000]	" that 's because they 're scared , not because of you " , said the queen . " with each passing day , things are turning more and more insane . when it returns they beg forgiveness for the
[84/1000]	chapter 14 - the challenge it was the most amazing experience i 'd ever had , because - nope . but only because , whatever happened afterward . that all comes with the territory . anyway ...
[85/1000]	" see you in a few ! " " oh , i ca n't wait to ! " and with that she was gone . chapter 10 after another good night night at the old man
[86/1000]	i did n't know who it was , just a figure in green stood away in the dark . i recognized the blue suit as my mother 's , an old friend who had died and left me alone .
[87/1000]	" you mean it ? i ca n't believe it . " i handed him a white envelope . in the envelope was my first real test and the doctor had to copy down my exam information . once
[88/1000]	she was n't as easy to sleep with when he was around . if she 'd thought he was the best - looking man she 'd ever met , that was nothing compared to the kind of dreams they 'd
[89/1000]	i looked my dad up and down and shrugged . " look at it this way . i have just one kid , but they have these new ids . " he nodded . " yeah , they all
[90/1000]	her stomach clenched and she did n't bother to talk , to try to explain what had happened . but before she could , the car lurched to a halt on the road where a single male - human woman
[91/1000]	i shook my head quietly . i did n't want to say the words until he understood . i did n't want him to know , not one bit . " i want you , kyrie . this f
[92/1000]	he shrugged and spoke in a slow drawl . " why do n't you just write me a letter and let me put it in writing , and we 'll do it at home ? " oh no please
[93/1000]	" with my son ? " " yes . " i could n't meet her eyes when i admitted , " he 's not here . that 's not what it looks like to me . "
[94/1000]	i did n't answer , and he cleared his throat after a second . " well , can i ask you something ? " ethan cleared his throat again . i had to look away . " of course
[95/1000]	" i am with a man who ... " " i know i said no relationships , " cut in catherine , " but i do n't have a choice . i 'm afraid i was wrong . "
[96/1000]	" this is the first test , " jack said . " you must know how to control your beast . focus on your breathing . you will be fine . " the two men , with a slight
[97/1000]	" we 'll take her , of course ... " " who ? " " the demon . we 'll take her and set things straight . " i stood , feeling the weight of the situation
[98/1000]	" yes , " he muttered with a grin . " and you already know that i 'm more than happy to oblige . " * * * " wait ! " i said breathlessly . the water
[99/1000]	" oh . no , no . it was definitely nothing like that . i just wanted what 's mine . i never said no to you , not as though that was the best thing for us after what
[100/1000]	" just leave us alone . just leave them alone . " no need to let them do it . they 're all too smart for him . " we 're really good at what we do , you know
[101/1000]	he made a clicking noise in his throat . " no . i should n't . if you do n't want to , go ahead . i know i 've hurt you . " " i do n't want
[102/1000]	my heart gave a silly gallop in my chest . what would happen if i let hunter be right these last couple of months ? was it my overactive imagination or was it the absolute certainty that i saw hunter
[103/1000]	" the reason you had to take a seat while i checked the restaurant is because my mother ordered a second course and you were just as likely to get the first one here . the rest of you ,
[104/1000]	" shit , " said peter , " well , maybe it 's all worth it . and <EOS> sure a couple of the fun of the way we need to kick and play in the hay . maybe you
[105/1000]	i sighed and leaned against the wall . there was so much i wanted to discuss with him , but he 'd already been so hurt by his father , he did n't need to know anymore . "
[106/1000]	i wanted to tell him . i wanted him to tell me , but i knew better , so i said nothing at all . " how do you know i 'm going to lose you ? " i
[107/1000]	" i ca n't imagine a less appealing subject . " " yes , because , with all of your money behind our new family headquarters , and the money you 've earned since returning here and the money
[108/1000]	jack noticed that , when he opened the door the guard at the entrance to the guard house immediately recognized him . jack stopped before handing the guard his wallet . " he gave this to me . "
[109/1000]	" we 'll run through the details later , " he assured her . " right now we need to get you back . we have to get you to a hospital and get you helped . " "
[110/1000]	" what are you doing at our house ? " sara asked and was surprised when her own voice sounded distant . " i flew down to the san francisco airport last night to check in . i 've
[111/1000]	" good morning , mom , " hannah said , sliding a glance at her mom . " why are you getting up this early in the morning , hannah ? you look like you slept for ten hours
[112/1000]	" good , " said his father . " i was a doctor when i met my wife . now i 'm more of an historian than a nurse . " a thought crossed his mind about who his wife
[113/1000]	" i 'm thinking about going back across the lake . i need to make my plan perfect . if i 'm not here , someone is using the lake to lure us into a trap . i take that
[114/1000]	" i know , i know . " i threw up my hands . " you have to understand it is very sad for them . " " he 'll still be there next week , " he said
[115/1000]	" you 're like any other woman we could get , " i said lightly . my sister - in - law , my mother , should know that most women have a soft spot for one another . in
[116/1000]	that 's the story . ' i shrugged . ' he was only sixteen . ' ' that 's right . and <EOS> ' course that started to piss on the living , and in a three -
[117/1000]	' no , sir , ' said vimes . ' i want to know what i 'll have to do to get it . ' ' well , i can give you the captain 's full knowledge on the
[118/1000]	i ca n't believe she did it , but i think i 'm happy for her . but there 's another reason she 's over here , which is how this entire situation started unfolding when my best friend moved
[119/1000]	he pressed his lips together , trying to hold back a grin . " i like the sound of that . " " i 'm just surprised you figured it out . in reality , you went to a
[120/1000]	he took my hand and pulled me . i knew i should n't want this . just because i was running out of time ... did n't mean he was going to get it out of me . we
[121/1000]	" look , " said the soldier beside her in russian , " take a look outside . " she looked down the street . four soldiers were carrying a man , wearing hospital masks . one of the soldiers
[122/1000]	" no . " and it was really too simple : she 'd said she had no desire to fight , and she 'd said he could ask one or the other of his " friends , " so
[123/1000]	" all right , enough with the flattery and the stupid lies ! " she screamed at him . " i 've been here seven years for eleven years , three months in the past , and i do n't
[124/1000]	" yeah ? " zane said expectantly . " i 'm working with the dea from a young age , " she said . " about twenty - five years . " zane was n't fazed . "
[125/1000]	' you ca n't lie ? like my father did and your mother ? ' ' no , of course not . ' ' why not ? ' ' they 're all liars , mrs daniels .
[126/1000]	" i 'm busy today , " he answered as he pushed a button that clicked the front of the desk to the correct position . " i need to speak with your secretary . i see there is
[127/1000]	though i am far more determined than i would have ever previously allowed someone else to be , i am more disappointed in myself now that i am allowing someone else to take control of the situation . my
[128/1000]	" you want in , you get me . " " oh , okay . " she went over to the armoire and quickly pulled on a pair of heavy jeans and a light - colored tank top .
[129/1000]	i do n't think the idea will appeal to him . " like all the bad in the world , " he says matter - of - factly . his sarcasm makes me grin . " yeah , like
[130/1000]	" not right up until right before i left for prison . " " i see , " jack said . " prison . that 's a nice word , is n't it ? " " yeah ,
[131/1000]	then the dark , shadowed voice went quiet . the woman 's voice . i froze . the question stuck in my throat . could be any time without even a breath to try . in the last year or
[132/1000]	he turns to me , giving me a funny smile and i smile back . then my dad 's voice comes over the com , " what 's that you 've been hearing on the com ? "
[133/1000]	' oh , stop putting on that innocent face , i know what that look is doing to me . i want to know more , so i 'm going to ask you that you explain it to me .
[134/1000]	he just laughed . " you are so cute when you 're mad at me . you have no idea . " i glared . " did you hear what you said ? i do n't care when you
[135/1000]	" okay , " she said . " then i would like to have something to eat . " grace started to get up out of bed but cole grabbed her hand and held it . " where are
[136/1000]	i smiled faintly to myself . " the very fact that they all knew about you all these years was enough to keep them from turning on you and killing you anyway , and especially from the very depths

[139/1000]	" we got ta get moving in the next few minutes or our food is going to go gone . " " i 'll help . " " great thought , but where would we go ? "
[140/1000]	" maybe you two should share the credit until your father gets here . " " you have to shut up , " mike retorted . " i do n't have time for this . " " you
[141/1000]	" you 're out of reach in a few seconds anyway . " jack continued to hold up her wrist , the movement so gentle that she could barely feel it . " have you thought about doing this before
[142/1000]	there was a faint scrape at the door . " what can i do ? " " wait here , " she called back to him , " do n't move . " he could n't stop the
[143/1000]	" i could n't agree more . " lucas nodded , and we walked outside again . " i 'll get you all the good coffee and pastries you want . where do you want to go first ? "
[144/1000]	the nurse was taken gently by surprise and she had no opportunity to apologize for it . she quickly went into her room and tried to calm the hysterical girl . " how long have you been in here
[145/1000]	" and your other son , did he have it too ? " " a few years back , he had a twin brother . one a singer , the other a painter . he was the eldest .
[146/1000]	" she knows that some of her people do n't go to a school that has an army . " he said . " she has a lot of ideas to work out with her family . " "
[147/1000]	" not nearly enough . " as the ship passed over the rocks out into the ocean again , we were shocked and confused , but comforted . we had fought back . if the ship could make a

[149/1000]	he pushed away with his shoulders and straightened his coat . " nothing like an enemy under your watch to set an example , is there ? " the man did not respond , but smiled kindly .
[150/1000]	" i knew you 'd say that , " i mumbled . " well , i 'm glad . i 'm going to call off tomorrow so i can get ready for bed . i have to be sick again
[151/1000]	emma felt warm and relaxed , having a strong desire for a warm bath and a good night 's sleep . this afternoon she 'd have to try and figure out how to handle this situation . this was her
[152/1000]	it was bad enough to be around her , so why did i want more ? i gave you time , my friend . i hoped to god her being there had nothing to do with me but
[153/1000]	" oh , god , " i say , clutching my stomach as if i want the world to stop ; as if i 've just shot a dagger through my side . " this hurts ... oh , my
[154/1000]	and the phone for the next three hours turned out to be a disaster . with no other choice , we resorted to a new strategy , which was to call the senator . i figured it was only right
[155/1000]	" good job <EOS> on the top , as a symbol of independence ... " " and now , and now ! " he looks around the room and grabs two glasses from the cabinet and pours out
[156/1000]	i looked out at the night sky . the sun was setting and everything was green with the moon coming up as it did . i could n't believe i had fallen in love with this man . i had
[157/1000]	he had to stop looking for me . did he forget about me all of a sudden ? was he even still here ? no . it did n't make sense for him to hold me after everything i
[158/1000]	" and about what ? " " nothing . " " and ? " " and it did nothing . i was never bothered . " when john opened his mouth , she continued . " but
[159/1000]	" fine . i 'm not going to spend the rest of my life hanging out with a woman from the opposite end of the spectrum . " he moved his fist to his right shoulder and winced at the
[160/1000]	it was then she noticed sam had n't moved . it became clear he was trying not to look at the same man with the same man 's voice , but not failing ... and ... the woman 's voice
[161/1000]	with each turn , the light on the phone , dimmed several degrees . the glow slowly faded into gloom . and then , very gently , the phone began to ring . her heart stopped , both
[162/1000]	" i think even you , a guy who 's just lost his best friend , know the difference of how he really feels . " maybe if she told him , the tension on his face would dissipate ,
[163/1000]	i stood there looking at his hand on my arm . what was she doing ? " did you guys ever kiss ? " i asked . he laughed . " she never kissed me . " i
[164/1000]	he let go of her hands and dropped them to his sides . " this is what you want from life . i do n't want to change it . you 're the one with everything we have - "
[165/1000]	by the end of the meal i was feeling like a rock and could n't stop grinning . chapter twenty - one i do n't know how much time had passed , weeks maybe ? but when peter
[166/1000]	the thing they tried to prevent , i bet , on themselves . " come on , " whispered peter to me , grasping my hand as we left the gym . we headed for the stairs to the
[167/1000]	i closed my eyes and took a deep breath to calm my nerves , but his words repeated like a mantra inside my head . the images of other women that i 'd lain with did n't quite match the
[168/1000]	" please , " i said . " yes , she has . i have to go with her now . " " you know you never should have let him go if it kept him alive . "
[169/1000]	" i did n't really think it was her in a ditch , but this guy 's head is n't under any kind of blanket , so it looks a bit , you know , weird . " "
[170/1000]	chapter 10 - epilogue " miss abby ... " mom 's voice breaks the silence like a loud clap . " it has been many months but you are still there . i 'm sorry , i do n't
[171/1000]	no way ! " uh , man ! " she glared at me . " there was a picture show , on friday ... " " we might have a thing on our books . " she shook
[172/1000]	" i wish you 'd have your gun , " john said . he was looking down at her , his eyebrows raised in challenge . sarah ignored him , but she knew there was something up there .
[173/1000]	" that 's really pretty , " he says as he shakes his blond head . i think he 's saying what he wants to say more than me , which is to make me happy , but i do
[174/1000]	that was her first inclination of the afternoon ; she 'd come down last night after all the guests had gone to bed , but found no one around . she 'd tried to sleep but it was like yawning
[175/1000]	" there have been such reports of people missing under siege from the city on the far side of the mountains , " said the captain commander of the storm wardens . " the siege ships are near an inlet
[176/1000]	" what do you mean , is he here ? " " not yet but he is on his way . the guards say he will be here shortly . " " for real ? " "
[177/1000]	something told her simon was going to be doing a lot of that - pushing , coaxing , cajo ling , soothing , telling her to give into him just a little . what amazed her more was how
[178/1000]	" they are ... do n't you see ? she 's all alone out there . she 's all alone . everyone else is gone , and i mean that literally . " " so you 've decided to
[179/1000]	" good . " " a night and a day of rest here . " his body had to function around her while he was here and her mind was foggy . " you 're going to need
[180/1000]	" i do n't care . she 's still my sister and she has n't let me just walk out the door yet . " he looked away . " i 'm just not ready for this . "
[181/1000]	" for what ? " " this stuff has n't been used since before my father first discovered it . " " you had to do something before ? " " not like , say , a
[182/1000]	" i 'll see to it mr. smith , thank you . " the officer walked away leaving the empty room to take his leave . chapter sixteen " hello . " i said entering the busy hospital
[183/1000]	" <EOS> " " what - a week . " " that too . " a loud snarl erupted under her . she ignored it - the only way to help xanthus . as long as
[184/1000]	" yes , i know . " " why not just say you do n't remember us ? " " because it makes this painful for me and i wo n't talk about it anymore . "
[185/1000]	they 'd started to speak when mike 's mom cut in . she was walking toward a chair at the counter , her eyes on her daughter . " i knew it , " she whispered . mike 's
[186/1000]	you are not alone , " he says . " i 've been thinking things through . i decided that the only way you 'll make it through this is with me . " " me ? " i
[187/1000]	" well , there . " i sighed and sat down in my chair . i kept the sunglasses on , despite the small amount of sun my eyes had been able to get , and i had my feet
[188/1000]	" i - it 's fine , " i mumbled . " you look flushed . " he held up his hands as both hands moved to the back of my neck and his fingers massaged me gently .
[189/1000]	he shrugged . he did n't blame her . not this time . " you 're too dangerous , " she said . he looked at her . " too dangerous for you , then ? do n't
[190/1000]	she giggled . " you 're incorrigible . " " i 'm serious . " " yes , you are . by the way , i like being a spy . " " just kidding . "
[191/1000]	she held up the box , and he did n't know whether to laugh or thank her . twenty minutes later , they were back on lake michigan 's dock . she pulled her phone out and called them
[192/1000]	the second man spoke for the third . " now we 'll take it of each other , " he said sarcastically . " we 'll do it and then later we 'll see about making up for it
[193/1000]	" no , there is also a way . " i was right . he seemed to relish that idea , but he had better keep it to himself . at least if he knew i was willing to be
[194/1000]	i know she 's confused , but she looks like she really likes him . he laughs at something a girl called julie says and reaches out to lightly squeeze her shoulders . " no , i have n't
[195/1000]	" i 'm sure as hell not planning on falling asleep now . " they were silent again . " i 'm surprised you did n't sleep the whole flight . " he draped his arm over her
[196/1000]	her head lifted , and her eyes widened . " what are you doing here ? " " i like you , " he said smoothly . " i 'm simply here for that reason . " a
[197/1000]	" i said , " she began , " that the best place to start is from a certain point of view : to find out how the world works . " " i do n't know , "
[198/1000]	" i miss the old woman ! my first time home . " daniel said suddenly , turning to face daniel and looking directly into his eyes . " i was a boy then from another area ; if i
[199/1000]	" that way , to the far right , " he said , gesturing to the left , " is the city of v iti ai . " " that 's so convenient , " i muttered . "
[200/1000]	" yes ! my goodness , no . " his eyes grew wide . " my goodness , yes , i have said as much , and still it is not true . i feel the same way , and
[201/1000]	" look , " mary jo said , trying to sound calm , " i do n't want a son married to someone who treats family like a - a prize . i know better , and i 'm sorry
[202/1000]	though i remember everything about the car , only now i notice something much more real . i see a couple of windows , but each is more than a mile away . it 's dark , and i 've
[203/1000]	" no ! " she was screaming at him now : " the others were close ! " " me , too , " he said . " the others were close to me , " she said
[204/1000]	" you may be aware they 're just looking for a place to meet again , " she said evenly . she almost did n't dare to hope he 'd change his mind , but then he changed his
[205/1000]	" only if you 're in a wheelchair . " i gave her a look . " so you 're going to stand there and tell me that you 're really a superhero ? " she smiled mischievously
[206/1000]	" you 're fine with that ? " he asked in disbelief . i took a deep breath to calm my nerves . " sure , why not ? as long as i 'm safe . " "
[207/1000]	the first time he saw her was after the accident , when he felt as if he had been dying all along . both sides and front of her had been blocked by massive boulders . he 'd been pushing
[208/1000]	" there 's no hope for the future , " she said somberly . but in many ways she knew he was right . " i have a gift for you , " he said softly . "
[209/1000]	" if she was telling the truth , you 'll never let her go . " " then kill me . " she reached out to press her hand to his . the fury suddenly vanished , leaving
[210/1000]	" you look so strange in the gown , " he said . she blushed more deeply . " you do look quite odd . you 're beautiful . " he stared at her . " in a
[211/1000]	the door of the hotel room suddenly opened and came swinging around . " what is it , charles ? " asked anna . she 'd been sitting on the chair and was on her feet . she caught
[212/1000]	" see ! " cried ydnas , getting up to show him the palm she had been checking . she held it up and indicated a place . " look at this ! " she said , with flourish .
[213/1000]	my world is like a small , bright star , or maybe a storm cloud , or a little storm , one that is too big to see in the normal world , but to see in the way the
[214/1000]	he kept talking , " this is the biggest project at this point in the project and all of us working on this project . we can finally achieve what we had always dreamed of , and have a huge
[215/1000]	he turned and saw something that looked like a gigantic insect crawling from under a blanket . " what the - " he began , but then heard a sound from above something that broke a song - like
[216/1000]	he looked down at his hands . " i 'm sorry for all i 've done to you . i wanted to believe that you wanted me , too . though i do n't believe it . i 've been
[217/1000]	" i 'm not going to bite you , " i retorted . " i could feed you to the pack . i 'm hardly in a position to force a shifter into submission or anything , am i ?
[218/1000]	" why ? did someone break into your place ? " he shakes his head , and when he looks back up , his face is stern and angry . " of course not ; it 's best we
[219/1000]	" no , it would n't . and i did n't get a chance to get to see him . he 's in jail somewhere . well . you know what i mean . they 're already putting him out
[220/1000]	when he got to the end of the lane on south road 28 2 he saw it , high and squat , the house and yard neatly landsca ped , its drive un fenced . the door was open .
[221/1000]	" really , i was just telling him to get some wine . you know how good they are with the sau vi gnon blanc . " " they serve a wine that has gone too long without any
[222/1000]	they would just have to be a tad fru gal . he returned to the kitchen and closed and locked the door behind him . he ran a hand over his forehead and exhaled a pained breath .
[223/1000]	i can see he 'd like that , so i push his hand away and start removing his hand . when his fingers fall away i look him straight in the eyes and say , " i wish you were
[224/1000]	" i think we should talk about this rationally . " " rationally ? do you have a freakin ' brain ? i 'm not going into a mental hospital and having my brain be paralyzed for months .
[225/1000]	" your dad and i do n't know how much time has passed . he 's been trying the best he could with your mom , but she 's been so depressed of late . i do n't know if
[226/1000]	" yes , sir . i 'm so sorry , sir . " " do n't be , " he said , and took a sip from his teacup . i had n't realized that he knew of my
[227/1000]	this had her staring at him in utter bewilderment . " you are , indeed , pretty . i 'm sure your mama loves you so much . " " can you tell her for us ? "
[228/1000]	not with who . not with who . chapter two " do you need help ? " he asked gruffly as he stared at the open door to the office . callie swallowed nervously , her
[229/1000]	" i feel , right now , more than ready . " he pulled off his t - shirt and tossed it , along with mine , on the floor , his t - shirt having landed somewhere on my
[230/1000]	i raised my eyebrows at the thought as two men walked round the corner . one of them was a guy in a clean uniform , but the other was slightly shorter . he was holding a mobile phone .
[231/1000]	" so let 's be honest . i have people . your men . those guys on the dock . i 'd keep them out of the mess . that could be the key , after all . there 's
[232/1000]	" me . " " that 's one of those things . " i could n't resist touching his collarbone . he shivered , then relaxed , giving me access to his chest . i ran my hands all
[233/1000]	" no , " he said . " this is the best thing that 's come out of my days . to think that , i could have died because i did n't have the nerve to ask you for
[234/1000]	" hi , you must be , " said a man 's voice . in response , i turned around . " your sister tells me you 've been living with her sister , " he said ,
[235/1000]	a strong surge of warmth coursed through me , and i took a deep breath . i could almost smell the scents of the hot , earthy earth and rain from the mountain above . no , i thought
[236/1000]	his face twisted as he felt her , his fingers still in her hair . " you 'll do anything to win him . " " no . " " yes , damn it . " he thrust
[237/1000]	do it . the door opens and an old woman in a nightgown steps inside and sees me hiding underneath the cot . " what the fuck do you think you 're doing tonight ? " she does
[238/1000]	" just for the sake of a one - man crew , ' fore you come to dinner , have you noticed ? they 're all holding you like you are the most powerful man in the world <EOS> "
[239/1000]	she started with what she knew : she planned to make them a target . they were being kept apart for no good reason and could be killed with no provocation , a plan she knew they would never execute
[240/1000]	" of course , " the receptionist said . she looked unhappy , though it was impossible to tell . " just in case . mr. holden , i have the number for your mother ? i 'll call her
[241/1000]	" please do n't talk to her like that . it 's bad enough you two will get together at school . you would be the most awkward , " she mutters . " she needs you to be
[242/1000]	she looked away , but not without a smirk as she dropped her gaze back to the page . he continued eating his steak and watching his family as if he were watching a movie that had never ended
[243/1000]	" a book ? " the young man stepped back , eyeing him . " a really large book . " " i know , but we need to take it back to my house , " tom told
[244/1000]	" the truth ? " peter and emma both nodded . " that , too , " emma said , " is something i usually know by my own conscience . " peter swallowed . " and
[245/1000]	" how do you know that ? " " because she was there . " " her name is - " " he can call her by her christian name . you 're all we have .
[246/1000]	i gave him a puzzled look . " why ? " i asked . " do you need someone to get the stuff ? " " no , we can call him . " i did n't believe
[247/1000]	" if the light is in your eyes - just say , ' that darkness for you is dark ' . " " good girl . " he winked . izzy handed him a piece of pie and he
[248/1000]	by the time the sun was high beyond the trees and sun blazed down the valley , she was already exhausted . she lay down in the shade and slept . a couple of nights after their conversation , she
[249/1000]	" there 's a kid 's picture in the paper , you know . " " well , yeah . you 're right . do n't know him . " the agent 's lips pressed together in a
[250/1000]	" my sentiments exactly . " " you should go on your first vacation like all the rest of us . " " if i do n't make it , it wo n't be easy . "
[251/1000]	she touched her chest . " sorry . you 've got to get out of there . " " we only stopped because i had to feed you , so do not ever go out unless it 's of
[252/1000]	she smiled faintly , and added , " when your brother comes back from the north , you can ask him to send him back . " before he could ask any more , a bright , white wolf
[253/1000]	" no . " he kept quiet , his eyes alert , wanting to take orders . " a man on the wall to the right of me heard someone talking to one of the guards , but
[254/1000]	" i would have never known if i were n't on top of you . " she could only nod , and then , quietly , he continued , " i got sick , and dr. wilson knocked me
[255/1000]	" fine . let 's do it . " as they left the hospital , james and olivia decided to drive to the city and grab a hotel dinner in the parking lot . a car pulled up ,
[256/1000]	one of them held up a finger while he spoke in hushed tones and i caught the words , " wait here . " he grabbed a couple of men and then gestured for me to stick to a safe

[258/1000]	" ok .. ok . " with the help of a stick he lifted the door with an ease he 'd never felt before . " they might be gone but the door - lock still works . "
[259/1000]	" like any other job . " paul rubbed a hand down his face . " i 've never seen any point in calling it real work . i just try to keep up . " " and you
[260/1000]	" yes . he left me a couple of times during the second year . you know , to make sure i got through it . " " why did n't you talk to him last year ? "
[261/1000]	" you do n't have to go to your apartment for dinner tonight , " he tries to console me . " of course i do . " i shake my head . i need to be prepared ,
[262/1000]	" oh , i knew it was you , " the guard said , his attention suddenly drawn by the smell of fresh blood . he grabbed his wife by the hair and dragged her toward the kitchen .
[263/1000]	he knew she 'd been listening . " oh no . what now , darling ? " he pressed his fingers to her lips , even though he was sure his stomach would clench with how cold she
[264/1000]	the sound of thunder roared through the trees , and suddenly their shelter opened . to their right was a vast flat expanse of snow and black sea stretching out into the valley , and to their left the rocky

[266/1000]	he slid off me , and his mouth dropped open . he turned , panting , to tell me he was still inside , but i 'd already crawled onto the pillow , pulling him upon me . he sat
[267/1000]	" well , yeah , " i say . she smiles and brings me a cup of coffee . we watch the television until i close my eyes to shut out the world . " okay , tomorrow
[268/1000]	" yeah , " he replies . " he did . " what do you feel about me ? i wonder . will i give him anything that 's solid ? how can i protect him ? can the
[269/1000]	" the hell i do . but trust me , one thing would be cool though . with me , i could fly you on over to south america and we would forget all of this . here in this
[270/1000]	" i 'm sure you wanted to be home for an entire week , you little traitor , " said his grandmother . " you spent all summer away . " it seemed unfair <EOS> then that he had
[271/1000]	the door to the suite opened . he caught the scent of perfume , which was probably perfume , that of his wife , rose . she had never smelled so good . " she 's here , "
[272/1000]	" i was n't going to leave you all alone there . i had to get out . " " what ? " " they were chasing me . " my voice was low , desperate . "
[273/1000]	with a swift movement , he shoved her into the closet . she landed behind him , slamming her knees into the corner . " what the hell ? " she asked . " get into the closet .
[274/1000]	* * * i was lying back , my head pil lowed on a pillow . the bright and breezy kitchen light was shining in through a porthole and a cool breeze washed across me from the balcony
[275/1000]	" oh , okay , " said peter , rubbing his eyes . " can i have some time so i can consider what he told me ? " " of course . it 'll be fine . "
[276/1000]	she shifted uncomfortably . " i think i have some good news . we 're running a short - term lease out through a new system . " he pulled out the little mouse for her to read ,
[277/1000]	he went back to looking at the file . " come on , we got things here to do . " she sounded tired . he glanced up at her . " what ? " " i
[278/1000]	" what the hell was that guy 's name ? " " a real scumbag who needed to be whipped . " i smiled at her . " i can imagine . " jessica continued , "
[279/1000]	" and how are you feeling ? " he was looking at me funny . his brow was drawn in a frown . maybe he was embarrassed . maybe he did n't like to make people uncomfortable .
[280/1000]	" <EOS> " she got off her bike too and walked up to him on the porch , grabbing her old parka from the chair . " you look tired , " he said , putting his hands
[281/1000]	" i got the best of you and i 'm happy to do it . " daniel said . " oh i 'll keep you a bachelor , you 're all a bad seed anyway . " "
[282/1000]	" fuck ! " he screamed at the top of his lungs again . " i 'm sorry ! i 'm sorry ! " " do n't be sorry ! " she screamed back , and for a moment
[283/1000]	" i 've got nothing . " his brows pulled together . " can i ask you one more question , then ? " my heart swelled in anticipation . " yes . " he moved closer
[284/1000]	i think i need a ride home later , she thought to herself . " okay , " he said , pulling his keys from his pocket . " i 'll see you at home . " she
[285/1000]	" you 'll have your chance to do something with your life , as long as you are . " <EOS> as much i could never get away from my little trip to the lake , because it was
[286/1000]	" but you 're just a little drunk . do you even know how to dance ? " " it 's not always that way , " she mumbled . " it 's kind of a ... well ,
[287/1000]	i heard myself moan from under the pillow . oh , shit . it was definitely me . i 'd been dreaming or experiencing the orgasm his mom had given him last night . yeah , this was
[288/1000]	" i 'm not there yet , " she answered sweetly . " i just need to go and take a shower . you got any dirty thoughts about washing my hair with that big hot tub ? "
[289/1000]	* * * the last of the storm clouds went far out over the mountains , and the stars were peeking out over eastern scotland . soon it would be night ; the storm tonight would be worse .
[290/1000]	* * * " where 's miss sinclair ? " " she went out for a drive . " he turned to face his butler . " i want the next part of this meeting . "
[291/1000]	" okay . " i tried to get up , but my body was numb and i stumbled forward . that could have just been a bad dream . i 'm sure it 's nothing to you . if it
[292/1000]	" what ? " " come on , " he urged again . i looked at myself in the mirror . my face was pale but the bruising beneath my eyes was mostly gone . i was a
[293/1000]	he took her hands and placed them over his heart , as if her touch could somehow restore her consciousness . " i 'm still here , are n't i ? " she nodded . " you need
[294/1000]	" do n't you miss your country ? " " no . " she shook her head . " i love my life and i do n't want it to stop any time soon . " maybe it
[295/1000]	he lifted a brow in disbelief . " a woman with a child at home ? " " yes . " she shook her head . " so much for making it a short trip . " "
[296/1000]	i had to get her to understand , so i said a few words about how happy i was to see her and how relieved i was that i could once again have a normal life with her . i
[297/1000]	he waited a beat before continuing . " i never said anything that would upset you . " he paused for a beat , then shrugged . " i just want you to be happy . " " i
[298/1000]	" what ? " i asked , grabbing at her . my phone buzzed from on top of my jeans . i checked the display and saw it was my number , or rather i 'm not sure . i
[299/1000]	" we 're on a planet of un tapped planets , " said henry . " the system is not in chaos . " " of course it is , " said calliope , which made me think again
[300/1000]	" i hope you 'll like my present . " " what is it ? " she asked again urgently . " a special night in my life . " " you 're kidding , right ?
[301/1000]	" how many ? " i asked my brother in disbelief . he pointed to the pack you would find at the bottom of the stairs . " three , maybe four ? " it kind of did smell of
[302/1000]	a young man emerged from the bushes surrounding the main tunnel and looked over his shoulder at them , then hurried into the bushes . " oh , we know you are a rat , " said chello ,
[303/1000]	he lifted the baby , which seemed to be kicking with a great little kick , and i felt the cool breath of the baby on my palm . " hold her . i 'll bring the baby , you
[304/1000]	she had decided , as she and her sisters had to do so , that they knew one day they would move back to the cabin . she also knew that she would n't allow that in her house now
[305/1000]	that was even worse . i wanted nothing more than to make him come and just rip off his pants , see if he looked so good in shorts . " for f * * k 's sake ,
[306/1000]	for a long minute , thomas seemed stunned by his answer . " he 's not my dad , " he whispered , then almost as if to himself he said , " that 's not like him .
[307/1000]	" you 'll get over him . it 's just ... now what 's with all this talk of my past being in the past ? " he looked at her impatiently , sensing her frustration and her growing anger
[308/1000]	" and he needs you , " my sister answered softly . " do n't do this to yourself . " my mother returned from the balcony when sam stepped out . she was dressed in jeans and a
[309/1000]	" that 's true . you did n't want to hear all kinds of things about old friends , did you ? " " no , but ... was that an accident ? " " no . you
[310/1000]	" you did . " " she was here . in the bedroom . " " the bedroom ? " i repeated slowly . my face burned . " yes , in the bedroom . i 'll
[311/1000]	" not even a little ? " he said , though his lips barely moved . " i think the last time we saw each other it was at a pub near sydney from a conversation we had , where
[312/1000]	" yes , miss turner , i am . you are correct . i do believe i have been informed who the head of the organization is . you would be ? " he knew ? " your
[313/1000]	the people have their own power , but not power enough to drive away the ghosts . " i believe it 's been in the works , but i 'm still confused , " rachel said on the phone
[314/1000]	" what are we doing ? " " getting ready to leave . " he took her right hand in his , then left for the other , linking their fingers and lacing their fingers tightly . "
[315/1000]	" i 'm sure she 's fine . it 's just that we 're all exhausted for the first time today . please help and have a seat . " she pointed straight ahead and waited for her companions to
[316/1000]	my cheeks burn even more , and i hate that he can obviously tell i did n't hold back . my hands ache to touch him , to kiss those lips . they are so soft , i know they
[317/1000]	" because he thinks i 'm going to go along with this thing . " " you are ? " " sure . the other night i came here without you . i 'm not a coward anymore
[318/1000]	' now ? ' ' yes , tonight actually . ' you ca n't send me flying into the other world while he 's home to his parents . it 's almost like not waking up at all
[319/1000]	" yeah . " " we 'll get the rest of them killed or killed by humans that have come through . that , too . you and i go together . " " what about the others
[320/1000]	" what are you doing now ? " i ask him . without waiting for a reply , he thrusts his tongue into my mouth and tugs on my tongue in a way that makes me gasp , and
[321/1000]	" what ? the flowers i saw in the garden and the statues had to be something else . " he nodded . " there 's a few variations on what happened in the garden . you were getting
[322/1000]	" not if i can help it , " i say . my hands are fisted on my hips , my arms crossed aggressively . he starts pacing around the room once he 's done and then he turns
[323/1000]	" we were talking about all the time when we arrived here , " alex told him . " yeah , " bob answered . " if you knew what we were talking about . it did n't
[324/1000]	i almost felt guilty that i did n't give myself the greatest opportunities to meet new people . but most recently i was in a committed relationship , and that was something the real world would just have to accept
[325/1000]	he nodded . she tried again . this time he spoke . " first of all , it was some time in the past . i did n't get back together with her , and i do n't
[326/1000]	he took me in his arms but said little . i had gone to sleep . he left me with my sleeping bags and my blankets . i pulled away from him and crawled into my spot and tried
[327/1000]	" in the winter of this year , you 'll be working . and as you know , the big project was a success . " " yes , i noticed that , " she allowed , after a
[328/1000]	i could not blame his reaction . " how did you come by your ring ? " he asked . and then i said the most awful things i could remember . " i grabbed it while
[329/1000]	" i have no idea what the problem is , " he said , taking a step towards the fridge . " it 's just ... i do n't have anything to send , and my grandmother does n't
[330/1000]	" i do n't remember why i wanted to go back . " i was n't getting it . " i do n't like men who do n't , " said bodo . " i have never had any
[331/1000]	" fine . we 'll meet back here . " shane shook hands with the new man , and they had a nice little chat . " hey - did you say that you used to work at the diner
[332/1000]	he leaned forward and kissed my bare shoulder . " he 's never gone before since katrina hit the rock . " i smiled as i thought of her . " i wonder how long he stays . "
[333/1000]	" to give birth to the beast . to feed the king . " " who - " i began but before i could hear anymore , she finished . " i have had visions of these future powers
[334/1000]	" yes , all of them , " beth announced as she walked into the coffee shop . she picked up a red - headed girl with big blue eyes in tow . " maybe , we 'll make some
[335/1000]	" do n't give me that talk . this is n't your job . we 're partners . they sent you . i want answers . " " fuck what they sent me . it 's time to go
[336/1000]	" of course i 'm hungry ! it 's two - fifty from here to work this morning ! " i rolled my eyes and turned back around as she walked off . " i 'll go in
[337/1000]	" i - she said i had to lie out here for the next year and the next , " i said . " that 's not necessarily a bad thing . it 's just , well , she
[338/1000]	' you 'll get what you want , ' added zeus . ' people always do . ' ' you have a good heart , ' she replied . ' at least we 've met a few times .
[339/1000]	" this is wrong . it 's too much . " " let 's stop being so ridiculous and start being healthy , " she pleaded . " the only reason i 'm pregnant is because we got married
[340/1000]	" do n't use the whole bathroom ? " he asked . i nodded . " i 'll see what i can do . " he walked back to the passenger side of his truck , and i
[341/1000]	" it 's the only reason i 'm telling you this . " " so what are you going to tell them ? " i asked , more hopeful . " i do n't know . what about
[342/1000]	he nodded solemnly . " i was a good boy . " " thank god for that . " he looked her up and down , frowning , and asked , " just for that ? "
[343/1000]	his teeth glinted , her own heart turned over as his intense eyes locked on hers . " i 'm going to do whatever it takes to keep you warm . " he turned to retrieve a blanket for
[344/1000]	he glanced at his watch . " we have to get out of here . " she shook her head . " not until ... " could n't he find a way to save her ? he 'd saved
[345/1000]	' well , that 's why i came by , ' said a voice behind them . ' it 's about time you showed up . ' ' you and the others . let 's go in , '
[346/1000]	she fell over on the floor and slid in between the mattresses . i ran to her , i knew what to do . i was going to make her take the pill . i was going to make
[347/1000]	i look up and find him peering down at my face . his brow wrinkles as he notices the blood on me . " i wonder how that looks . " he says quickly . " do you need
[348/1000]	there was no one there . which meant i should probably find some other humans just to get their story into their heads . but i was going to try anyway . i could n't get out of
[349/1000]	the woman 's dark blue eyes did n't find hers . " you know how he is about his hair . " oh , yeah , she did . like that was good proof . " do you
[350/1000]	he took the tray and went to his room to dress in the company of the young warrior who had come to accompany him there . as the young man left , lord rand wulf spoke to another servant .
[351/1000]	" so now you know why i did n't want to tell you about the wedding . " " not yet . i just hope you know what you are doing . " " i have no idea
[352/1000]	" not bad in the usual sense but as you must have noticed i do n't need any additional motivation to get right on the phone . that is , that i do n't want any big problems today with
[353/1000]	" i know , " i said . " there was something else too . " " what else ? " she asked in that same sweet voice . i watched her mouth , the one in the parking
[354/1000]	" it 's more than a lot of people , " he said , shrugging in a negative way . " it 's about that stupid ... thing . " " i 'm sure they 'll get it ,
[355/1000]	i could n't help glancing over at christian , who sat in the middle of the circle of men . he met my eyes , then looked to my father . " can you give us the location of
[356/1000]	he gave me a wicked grin . " you 're going to love london . " " i am ? " he nodded . " my father is one of the richest and most powerful men in the
[357/1000]	i say nothing . my mouth is still hanging open . he looks at me like i 'm an idiot . " oh no you do n't " , neal says , not taking his eyes off me .
[358/1000]	' not even in times of danger ? ' asked beowulf , ' is anyone out there that can see that ? ' ' ah , i did try to keep this news to myself a bit , but
[359/1000]	" i ca n't , " she said . " i must take her somewhere else . " " what 's in his heart ? " the soldier asked . his voice held the same gentleness as the man
[360/1000]	the lights came on in the room , and after a few seconds , the men in suits sat in their chairs . they all stood . " for you one of the victims . " they
[361/1000]	" very high , " he says . " but we must n't confuse some of the men with some of the other things we 're doing just now . if they know more about our lives , they 'll
[362/1000]	" i should 've told you i came for this . i should n't have tried to reason with you . " " then you do n't have him . " " i might . but i 'm
[363/1000]	you read my mind . we were alone . i did . you feel it . you know i 'm lying . i felt it . how do you know ? i do n't know
[364/1000]	" this is why we 're here . " the man gestured to the small cluster of trees in the center of the clearing , to the small pile of broken tree leaves and splintered wood from the roof of
[365/1000]	" who for ? " " just wait , okay . let him pass first , " said one of the other humans who stood for a second , then turned and took off . i stayed where
[366/1000]	" of course , " said the lady . " it was my own doing . " she winked , but they appeared to be holding their breath . suddenly things were moving . a series of small explosions
[367/1000]	" i believe i see that you have a gift , lass , more than most . do you know of its significance ? " " um ... " she tilted her head a little and glanced down when
[368/1000]	everyone remained there a moment , looking at the two brothers , sizing them up . they both had the same cocky , smug smiles that adam had seen as well . adam felt a bitter taste in his mouth
[369/1000]	i 'm not going to push her . she looks up and catches my eyes again , her eyes full of something and i do n't know what it is , but i could n't name it with this
[370/1000]	" then do n't tell me that you love me . " he takes my face in his hands and kisses me . " i should love you . but there 's no way . " i sit
[371/1000]	and then she leaned into logan 's shoulder . not wanting to be close to her other friends , she looked down the hallway and saw a group of kids , girls all , wearing white . and their faces
[372/1000]	" my name is n andi . " she waved a hand in front of the red cross on the side of her dress in a dismissive gesture . " i 'm a member of the committee to resurrect an
[373/1000]	he pulled his hand away , and looked down at the ground , his back stiff . " yes , i do know that . but you did n't . " chapter thirty anna thought that the
[374/1000]	a woman 's soft voice said , " and what 's the matter , girl ? you do n't want to leave ? " " god , no , " julie said . " it 's - i mean
[375/1000]	" please , no . no more secrets , alex . i need more time with you . especially more . " alex rubbed his hands together , as though to cool himself off . " if you know
[376/1000]	she would have preferred to have her children have a chance to learn there were other ways of healing , but if the disease was spreading out of her body so quickly , who could say ? she held
[377/1000]	" a little , " she murmured . i would have left , but she put her hand out and i turned back to her , forcing a smile to my face . " of all the doors that
[378/1000]	i shook my head . " no . " i moved closer to him , leaning in to kiss him again . he cupped my chin , kissing me gently . " you 're making me want you .
[379/1000]	" how many were killed ? " " i ca n't tell , " he said , more matter - of - factly than she 'd ever heard him . " i really ca n't . " "
[380/1000]	then i started , " indy , indy to say your folk s 're comin ' , " indy said . i thought i got out the last word . * * * * * i was
[381/1000]	" she 's just worried about you , is all . she should n't be alone . you need to stop thinking about her like that . " it was hard to go from being worried to thinking about
[382/1000]	a few months , and then it will be gone . so , i will begin to forget him . a few months , and then all this will fall apart . i close my fingers around
[383/1000]	' okay . ' ' you have two choices , ' he suggested , ignoring her comment . ' you enter the house . if you do n't wish to go in there , you ca n't enter the
[384/1000]	" it 's nice to have a voice when you want one . " he looked slightly embarrassed . " but what are you doing here ? what have you done now ? " " i 'm here to
[385/1000]	" uh - huh . " " you 're having trouble with your vision ? " " yes . it takes lots of magic to see anything , especially in the dark . " " i see
[386/1000]	" i 'm a cop , not a football player . no offence , but no one deserves what you 're planning to do , " nick said , cutting off his angry words and glaring at his cousin .
[387/1000]	" for now , " i agreed as he grabbed my wrist , lifted my hair and tucked it over my br * * sts , so my n * * ples could get to him . my breathing hitched
[388/1000]	" what happened to the baby ? " she could barely even breathe . " we were making love . she had a big head . " the baby . it 's a baby . it 's a
[389/1000]	two days before march , however , the same day , there was still turmoil in the streets , fighting at the gates to the city . the night was grim on the streets , as are all the
[390/1000]	the crowd shouted , hands in the act of tying their free ends . " one ! " someone shouted . " two ! " someone screamed . a pair of hands were caught suddenly , then another
[391/1000]	her eyebrows rise and her gaze immediately falls to the bulge in my jeans . " is going commando bad for me ? " " is that the best you can hope for ? " i ask deadpan .
[392/1000]	" i do . and i wo n't tell anyone , ever ! " that was a lie , but it could be the only lie he could bear - the one that made her stay . " thank
[393/1000]	he had it all in the eye . she was being paid to stop and help , and she 'd make it work . " all right , " she said , accepting the flowers . it
[394/1000]	the door squeaked open and two nurses walked in . they had on fuzzy white slippers and carried a thick orange pillow in a white plastic bag that looked like an antique . as they approached , dr. o' leary
[395/1000]	" he let you in . oh god . " she covered her mouth , her own face getting hot . " i f * * king ca n't believe i just did that . " " it 's
[396/1000]	" do you not remember that you have a cousin or sister in america ? " she paused as he stared at her face . " no . yes , my cousin and i are from america . "
[397/1000]	" i saw you talking with another man 's wife . i went with your aunt to make sure you were okay ! " " that 's not true ... " " look <EOS> damn it . "
[398/1000]	" do you - ? " for a fraction of a second , he was afraid for her . he had to save her . but his gut told him to do those things . " i did
[399/1000]	" what the hell ? " " what are they selling ? " i asked , pointing at the display . " i dunno . " " a dozen bottles of wine ? " " do
[400/1000]	" so is this a warning ? " ben asked , grinning . " no , it 's what is , " said the older lad who turned out to be billy . " we 're making you one
[401/1000]	" what the fuck are you going on about ? " i ca n't hide my surprise . " for f * * k sake , dad , you know there 's no way the media could find out the
[402/1000]	" it 's all good . " " there 's more to it . you 've heard of the big - deal deals the press makes on the big money ? " she nodded . " on the big money
[403/1000]	" nothing . " " really ? " he was intrigued by the way she spoke . it was n't like her to be quiet and talkative , but even though she talked in a normal voice , she
[404/1000]	" is that really necessary ? " that was the thing , was n't it ? we had been at war with each other for so long . he 'd been my hero ... after all , i knew nothing
[405/1000]	i did n't know how to answer that . any vampire , no matter how inexperienced , could tell a vampire was different after a transformation . i 'd been too conscious of the change to even consider a human
[406/1000]	" will you have something to drink before we head out tomorrow ? i thought we could try to sit by the pool and drink our drinks . " she considered . " perhaps . i 'm not quite
[407/1000]	their laughter lasted only a few moments , but through it all he was focused on the woman he 'd loved for years . emma sat still in the kitchen kitchen watching the fire . it was n't long
[408/1000]	and then as though our lives really had disappeared or was being swept under the ever - moving sea of meaningless words and phrases , i found myself calling out , " hi , daddy ! i heard you cry
[409/1000]	he thought she had to be some sort of a joke , right ? but she looked so vulnerable that he did n't let her distract him further . " no , she was just trying to be friendly because
[410/1000]	i had seen him , before , on the night of the murder , but had never seen him in person , at all . a tall man in a long black overcoat that gleamed with a great many beads
[411/1000]	our eyes met again and i wanted to tell him i never wanted to see him again , never wanted to feel his lips against mine , never wanted to feel his steely steel hands on my flesh ... but
[412/1000]	' so , that 's it ! ' he said , suddenly sounding very interested ! ' but why ? ' i said . ' why what ? ' ' why did you choose it ? '
[413/1000]	" right , " paul said , " so ... am i getting you in or what ? " rachel felt herself getting angry . " that 's not any of your business , " she said .
[414/1000]	" hi , " i say in greeting , hugging him . i 've had to pry my hand off him enough to free my fingers for him to take a step back . he frowns , his brows
[415/1000]	" oh , now you care ? " she gasped , suddenly so shocked , she started laughing so hard she threw her arms around his neck . because somehow , that did n't seem nearly as ludicrous as it
[416/1000]	the smell of the cooking meat and spices , the sweet musk of the ox , reminded me of a time , how i used to come here to eat . ' will you remember this when you return
[417/1000]	the phone rang and i picked it up . " hello ? " " hi , hannah . hello , eric , " rebecca said into the phone . i blinked . what the hell was she talking
[418/1000]	" well , he 's a bastard . " i looked at my father in surprise . " does he always say what he thinks i want to hear ? " my mother gave me a look
[419/1000]	" do you still feel that way ? " she asks , tilting her head . " huh ? " she licks her lips before she answers . " about me . " my stomach clenches in
[420/1000]	" i promise i 'll have sex with you in a few days . " the word sounds perfect as if she had a giant pink caterpillar slithering out of her mouth . " and that one ?
[421/1000]	" with the money and your home , i 'm sure that <EOS> just means you 'll have to use the extra cash . " " i mean it , " said zack , " why do n't you
[422/1000]	" i think we should go , " he said quietly . his deep voice drew me , but i did n't understand it at first . i wanted to know everything - everything dad had ever said about dad
[423/1000]	" for the time being , " i said . " just know . for as long as we both live . " her eyes hardened . " because it 's the only way you 'll ever be happy
[424/1000]	her legs would n't hold any longer , her eyes slipped shut , she sagged onto the bed . in his arms , she was safe . easy . the pain from the gunshot and the terror of
[425/1000]	or not . he certainly did n't feel right in wearing a kilt and he would , too . he 'd promised her he 'd watch his own back . and he would very much like to help whatever mission
[426/1000]	it was still dark out when they got home . she was wearing a soft orange bathrobe , her face in shadows , her hair in a curl , and she turned her head so he could see the blush
[427/1000]	" you are the one who is going to come back , daniel . but if you ever want to come back , you know where to find me . " with one last look at his father , he
[428/1000]	" no ! " a moment passed before he spoke . " what happened ? " " the - the fire ... in the woods . i hid , just like you said , to keep from getting
[429/1000]	and with that , the world went to shit . i got close to natalie . for days i got close because i thought we were going to blow the house up where she was f * * king .
[430/1000]	once outside , the fresh air was cleansing and exhilarating . the sun rose , casting the surrounding landscape in an orange glow against the rich , green grass . birds flew from tree to tree , chirping with a
[431/1000]	" really , i think that for this thing they needed , you need an exact date . at least a night that 's fair and not so dark . " there is a knock on the door that
[432/1000]	or at least it had until she 'd come to him . but after last night , she 'd changed . she trusted him . that was worth something . but that still did n't mean she just did
[433/1000]	there was a loud whirring sound that would shake the rafters near the ceiling . the security guard had arrived . " oh , no . " this time when sergei glanced up , darcy was prepared
[434/1000]	" he 's been hurt more . " i look at him , shocked that i 'm doing this . " i 've lied to you . " " i know . " greyson sighs again . " i
[435/1000]	" then i 'll make you a drink , " he declared . " what if i do n't want one ? " i told him a couple of minutes later . " i 'm not as nervous as
[436/1000]	" ok . i 'll leave you to it . " the general shrugged . " so ? tell me , will . " " get your friend of the family over here . get her dressed
[437/1000]	she put the brush down and wiped the wetness from her hands on her jeans . he was looking at her , and had a strangely hypnotic , hooded look that might have been sexy back in her day
[438/1000]	" if the time comes , you 'll know . " " i just wonder if i can understand . i know i ca n't . " " you 're not my best person right now . i
[439/1000]	" go ! " she nodded and turned to flee through the door . she was running down the hall when she heard the lock click behind her . looking back to check her step , she was
[440/1000]	" i 'll go wait upstairs . " jamie nodded and followed the doctor , who turned to jamie , who followed the doctor up the stairs to the second floor . there , the doctor lit a candle
[441/1000]	i think like an animal , i think like a monster , i think like - i think about the blood i 'd spilled . she had n't seen it , but she knew . she knew that ,
[442/1000]	" do n't worry . we 'll find her . there 's too much damage . " * * * there was a new arrival to the camp . a man with a huge chest and barrel chest
[443/1000]	" he needed help with his dad . " " yes . for a while , he used to be normal . he had a nice - looking girl , but now he 's an ass * * le
[444/1000]	" damn , " he said . " i told you , you 're gon na be really pissed at me if i say the next few hours are going to be anything other than bad , yeah ? "
[445/1000]	" so , what 's this ' no - one told you ? ' again . " her stomach clenched as she remembered the day he 'd explained . " i do n't know . " " i
[446/1000]	she leaned toward me . " no . thank you , but you have n't . " " have you lost something ? " " i do n't know if i 've lost it or whether it 's
[447/1000]	" good , " she said with a smile . " you still think it 's a good idea for us to fight ? " " well , no . i do not . " he rose from his
[448/1000]	" you have n't had an abortion ? " i asked him incredulously . he gave me a confused look . " no , we had good sex . that 's you . but i did n't have time
[449/1000]	' that does n't make sense ! ' ' you 're the one who says it does , ' said the agent . ' you 're not supposed to know . ' the window exploded towards the point
[450/1000]	the man watched that hand for a moment with those cool stare . the gun moved . the bullet missed her . he lifted his hand . the guy moved his pistol closer to her forehead , as if he
[451/1000]	but now she was back <EOS> - the part in her mind which could n't be taught anymore . that part were all new ? she was still not quite sure ; some more he had gone . and what
[452/1000]	" it 's fine , " said jason . " stay here with him for a bit . " " i might have to . " " not by yourself , honey . you know there 's got
[453/1000]	" i want to see if dr. schneider was right about the bacteria . " another moment went by . nella felt like she was shaking from the inside out . she went to her knees and ran her
[454/1000]	" you 're such a smartass , " i whispered . his hand went to the back of my head and he pulled me closer , our mouths met and with that , i had my answer . when
[455/1000]	before he could respond , simon whispered heatedly , " you think you can come to any conclusion but that ? " simon 's voice was low and warning . he moved as if ready to fight , and
[456/1000]	the car bounced and skidded as it tried to get away from the curb . " it 's okay . " the one with gray eyes , one of the only ones that did n't bug me . it
[457/1000]	the second boy was a smaller child . he was maybe ten instead of twelve , and his curly brown curls were mostly hidden beneath his shiny green head cap . he stared vacantly at the little camera , and
[458/1000]	she was n't dead . at least this time she had lived . only barely . " hurry , " he said quietly . " get out of here . " the door closed with a bang behind
[459/1000]	" yes . i want you to promise me you 'll watch over us . " i grinned at her . " oh , i intend to . " " not unless you want me to stay here
[460/1000]	she looked up at me with that confused little grin on her face . ' sorry . what ? ' ' my question . i asked you what i was doing here . i want to know who left
[461/1000]	" yeah . " " give me a call at his house , and i 'll make sure he 's okay . " " yeah , " he said . david reached for the phone and hit
[462/1000]	" when i told him you just wanted to help him on the case ... he did n't believe me . " " and you 're just now finding out about him ? when do you think he 's
[463/1000]	" why are you upset ? " she asked them . " because you are not the woman i want , you are not my woman . i wo n't hurt you , " he said . he
[464/1000]	my head shakes back and forth , in response to his question . " i do n't know , man . i think i heard something , but did n't think it was a good sign . " he
[465/1000]	if i went , i do n't know if i 'd be able to get him . they 'd be expecting you to go the next time your aunt 's been there . " " i thought i would
[466/1000]	" the man who did this is still alive , but with some damage to his heart . is n't he ? " she asked . " i 'm not sure . i think he can walk , "
[467/1000]	i tried to tell you ... the door swung open to reveal an older woman . " i want to speak , and you ca n't leave my care , young man . " " sorry , i
[468/1000]	she shook her head as she answered . " i do nt want to talk about it , " she mumbled . the pain that had shot through her chest had returned , and she started to feel nauseated .
[469/1000]	" does everyone know , " she said lightly , staring absently over the bay . ryan looked down at them both , his eyes narrowing . " all ? " she laughed . " i do n't
[470/1000]	" but he always comes back like this ! " i said , finally snapping out of my moment . " he always comes home . do n't you see ? he knows about that bomb ! he knows that
[471/1000]	" you 've lost it , girl . " she looked down , picking at the grass in her yard . " i 'm going back to maine . i 'll be waiting for you here then . " her
[472/1000]	" so you want me to do what ? " " if you want to go out , i 'm going to put you in a hole and get you ready . if you want real food , i
[473/1000]	" or , " i continued , " it really was just a matter of time . they kept going in the wrong direction . " but she had not . she had gone right back without me .
[474/1000]	" you 're such a jackass , " i say with a laugh . " you 're so pretty , " mr. garrett replies as he leans over and kisses my forehead . i laugh and sit up
[475/1000]	" i see to it that all our work is done . the church should not take ill when it comes to god 's welfare . " " when it comes to my work ? " he sounded incredulous
[476/1000]	ethan was going to be the death of me . so why did i still want him so badly ? chapter 45 " it took longer than we expected to clean up in our vehicles yesterday and
[477/1000]	you feel like you 've known me your entire life ? she nods . wow , " i say , leaning back so i can catch my breath . " what did you say ? " "
[478/1000]	a flash of green light in the sky said he 'd landed on a large slab of red brick , or at least that 's what the sign said . the man waited a moment , but a single beam
[479/1000]	" what are you ? " i asked softly , my hand at his wrist . " i told you before , the boys are safe . " " you 're a grown man . " "
[480/1000]	" i gave him good reasons to stay here . " silence <EOS> and prentice could swear he heard her voice when he said , " prentice ... " there was no change in her tone . he
[481/1000]	" do you want to know what happened to this town ? if you do n't tell me , i will . " " no , i do n't want to know . " " oh , you
[482/1000]	' that 's one way of putting it , but to start with you do n't have one very good reason to want to be around her . ' ' i used to like lucy , you know ,
[483/1000]	what kind of crap is that ? as if she 's talking about the entire world , her gaze sweeps to the street and she turns toward me . she shakes her head and says , " i should
[484/1000]	but none of that mattered but her own , now and forever . if the council got hold of her ... the last thing she wanted was for the council to learn that she 'd gotten herself pregnant ,
[485/1000]	i 'm just too afraid to tell him my deepest fears . " i need to go , " i whisper and turn to leave . he stops me , taking me by the arm . " when your
[486/1000]	she threw a glance at him , surprised at how much affection he had for her . yes , he loved her ; he just was n't in the same place she was . she began to read the line
[487/1000]	" here she is , " said his cousin a few seconds later . he motioned for me to walk up , and i did . he took my hand and lightly rubbed it . " it 's
[488/1000]	" it is , but - " " but what ? " " you want answers , do n't you and i do ? " " go ahead . " i pointed at the table . he
[489/1000]	you were so stupid again , he thought with a stab of shame . you 're a bad boy . when he approached the hospital doors , he saw that the emergency entrance was open . when the valet
[490/1000]	" all right , then , " said steve . " i 'll just leave a note for the police then . " steve walked out the door and down the steps , walking the way they had come
[491/1000]	" okay , but does n't that leave me out ? i do n't know why you want to do this so bad . " " it does ! your brother is always begging me to help him do
[492/1000]	" what did you say ? " " <EOS> " - i can feel him behind my cheek , " she 's gone to the beach ! " " <EOS> " - it 's only a trip across
[493/1000]	the door to the bedroom finally opened enough for him to see a man dressed in a sleek , dark - hunter outfit . the moment the male 's eyes caught sight of the blood on the carpet , he
[494/1000]	i ran my fingers down his chest to his belt buckle but he slid his thumb across my lips . " later , " he whispered . i nodded , gave him a smile and walked to the
[495/1000]	she nodded and sat down on the bench . " please remember where you two belong so we can discuss the wedding , " she said and shook her head as she turned around and reached for her coffee .
[496/1000]	and then came his lips on her wrist . as his mouth sucked her blood , the world fell away , and only her and niol were there for her . * * * " what the
[497/1000]	" i ca n't be responsible for a disaster like this . " she was in tears , her eyes filled with tears . " then she starts to hurt you . " nathan lowered his head , holding
[498/1000]	" fuck me , " i blurted . he grinned at me and answered , " i have . " that made him feel better and f * * k him , i let him know so i
[499/1000]	i had nothing . i wanted to go upstairs and cry , but there was no way , not now . not after everything . maybe not ever . all a lie . once upstairs , i found
[500/1000]	" well , i am glad you 'll be here anyway , " rachel said happily , and went into the bedroom . the door closed softly . she threw off her clothes and left the bed , going
[501/1000]	" when the vampires come , " he said . " they 'll take you . " " i do n't think so . i think it 's a bad idea . i think if i go with them
[502/1000]	" to be perfectly frank , you were wrong about me . i do n't act that way . " " i 'm giving you full credit for what you 've done . " " it 's none
[503/1000]	the girl nodded . " of course . " " stay here just this once , " he told me , " give us a moment . " i waited as my father returned with a dark -
[504/1000]	after the meeting with the other women , i had spent the day in my room . i sat staring out my window at <EOS> had read a toy . the television was not long and had n't taken to
[505/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i looked at her , an eyebrow raised in question . " you sound confused . " " i 'm happy for you . i feel sorry for everyone else ,
[506/1000]	it 's too late to be scared of him , so when he gets some wood on , i find myself standing right next to him . i 'd probably crack and shatter if his hand felt the same way
[507/1000]	the next day kate asked kate the same question . she knew that the conversation would break the ice . " are you feeling sick ? " " no , i 'm fine , really . i just have
[508/1000]	" i do not care , " she said coldly , keeping her eyes on his . " i did not know you were coming . " " it was a last resort . " " a last
[509/1000]	" that depends on which side of the argument you believe your story is , " came the muffled reply . " which side are you on , mr. stone ? " " i 'm on you .
[510/1000]	instead , the demon stepped closer , his gaze raking over her face , leaving welts and tears , cuts and scrapes from the battle . " i 'm far too much of a monster to hate you now ,
[511/1000]	and when i took her hands and led her down the stairs and into the lounge , i felt her hesitate . i had to force myself not to take a step back and take her with me .
[512/1000]	" i hear that very little leaves your mind , at least for now , " he said , " but still , go on . let me drink the wine , and then we shall talk . "
[513/1000]	she thought about that for a long moment . " i 'm guessing it 's you . " " it 's me . " she looked up at him . " how come you 're still alive ?
[514/1000]	" no , absolutely not , " she said . " we 've been through this . we both know that 's not how it works . we 're both committed to getting through this . we 've both worked
[515/1000]	" what else was he doing though ? " " just cleaning , " i said . " he had some stuff in the car that he had to use at the office . " " did you
[516/1000]	" well , " he said , shaking his head , " the question remains : and how are you going to do that ? get through the fire without breaking every bone or breaking more than a couple of
[517/1000]	" hey , i 'm not doing any of that , " he said , annoyed . but he knew it was to her good . his hands were shaking , his legs quaking , and he started to
[518/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " she said . " that 's not possible . i mean , everyone in my family is married <EOS> <EOS> - that kind of everything that had something . there was a baby ...
[519/1000]	" the man is a witch ? " he frowned . " why would he take her ? " " one of the witches told me he fed off animals . " the king rubbed his eyebrows .
[520/1000]	" i 'm not going to give it to you . " luke tried to grab the papers , but the cop stepped forward and grabbed them , twisting the papers out of luke 's hands . he tossed
[521/1000]	" you do n't happen to know a nice big house with a garage attached , do you ? " i asked , holding up one finger . he groaned . " god , no . i like walking
[522/1000]	that evening he was at night on his back in the straw hut with a pack of camels . they had to make it through the night before reaching the next village and as the darkness settled over the world
[523/1000]	once , at a party , the person to whom mrs. mac gregor had first introduced him had been an older woman , a lovely lady with a fine , long face and large , gray eyes . her long
[524/1000]	" i have n't seen the boy since that day , " the child named charles said softly . " and i thought you would be home . " " who is he , charles ? " "
[525/1000]	" the same things that went on in here . they get off on fear . " like everyone i know , i think i 've come to the same conclusion . but the more we talk , the
[526/1000]	his lips barely brushed against mine before he turned away , walking over to the window and gazing down at the city . in only a few seconds , i was under his spell , my stomach tight with anticipation
[527/1000]	one of them was a black guy holding out his hand to them . " i 'm kevin . " " i am zoe , " she said , putting her hand in kevin 's , feeling the warmth
[528/1000]	" ah , you 'll be back for it soon enough , " he reassured me . " <EOS> now you can be with the way . as long as you behave with us . " " how can
[529/1000]	" what if they can do that ? " she asked . " yeah , i dunno . but some people work too hard to be evil . and some people who are not evil are good . think
[530/1000]	the rest of a day 's work is going well : having a cat . he sleeps well at night and he gets up early , at the crack of dawn . he 's even more energetic when food is
[531/1000]	" i did n't think there would be any people around today ? " " probably not , " she admitted , " but the government had to have something now . anything else would have tipped us off
[532/1000]	" he 's a very different creature from the one you saw yesterday , " the guardian said . " he feels nothing but shame and anger . i would not assume the worst of him , because i
[533/1000]	" i found two bodies in the parking lot of the restaurant one night . another of the victims was a senior citizen . mrs. williams was killed last month , and a couple of years ago a colleague of
[534/1000]	there 's no point in denying it . " i wo n't , but i appreciate the offer . will you promise me that you wo n't put it off ? " " why ? " i ask
[535/1000]	" you are not a coward lord . we say ' yes . ' " the prince felt a surge of anger surge through him , something visceral and irrational that welled through his body . he ignored it
[536/1000]	it was not a comfortable place to be . the walls were brown , the floor cracked , the air stale . the only trace of habitation was a huge wooden desk and a small tv set placed on a
[537/1000]	" no . " " you did n't . " he pushed her hair back and looked at her . " in the beginning , it was a joke . " " a joke ? " she snorted
[538/1000]	she tried not to look at him as she said , " let 's go back a bit and see if they come back here this evening . " they each took a side seat so he could rest
[539/1000]	he nodded at the two other men , whom he suspected must be a mercenary and hired goon , seated on the steps of the huge mansion , and said , " we 're going to give you ten lashes
[540/1000]	" and if you think we 're going to get a lot of practice trying to scare them right in the nick of time ? " " we do n't need all that much practice . i could shoot
[541/1000]	" you are . " she smiled . " i am always grateful , my lady , but i am also weary of being the sole protector . i suppose i should be grateful for being able to command
[542/1000]	" he is always nice to me , but there is something about him . " i had to give him credit for not being insulted by my comment . " i know what you mean . "
[543/1000]	" yes , " she says , biting hers . she wipes the sweat off her face and tries to make eye contact , but she ca n't hold it in . she 's scared shitless still and her husband
[544/1000]	" yes . " the only sound that penetrated the hushed room was a whisper of air , blowing gently across the floor , and before katherine could say anything more , a cool hand slid along her shoulder
[545/1000]	" nothing , " she said coldly . " do n't you talk to me about my life . " " if you 're not married , then who are you living with ? " he asked .
[546/1000]	" okay , yes ! because we 're all supposed to be . i want the credit , thank you very much . thank you very much ! " i said to them all , beaming at them .
[547/1000]	" hey there , " she smiled . " hey you , " she said , reaching into her purse and pulling out her smartphone and showing it to him . " all right , " he said
[548/1000]	" if that 's all , " i finally said . " i 'll deal with some things tomorrow . i have to be at the dance at seven - thirty . " i turned because he opened the door
[549/1000]	but he could n't take his eyes off her . she had a look of pure arousal on her face ; even from across a room he could see it radiating from her body . he could also smell it
[550/1000]	" no , it 's hard to believe . but i 'm getting close . too close . " i reached forward for her hand . she jerked free , holding her hand over her chest , as if
[551/1000]	they climbed a hill , and the sounds of the lake gradually faded , and they passed the second time they 'd ridden to the lake . they stopped at a lookout point , and the boys lit a
[552/1000]	' no , i 'm not , ' he blurted . her face crumpled . that was the hard part . she wanted him , a man . not one of the sex slaves from yesterday . she wanted
[553/1000]	" you do n't need to talk about your father . " the way he said it , so quietly , hurt more than it should have . " that 's not fair , dad . " "
[554/1000]	" have you ever been a virgin ? " " you know i have been a virgin , but i 'm not sure i want to answer that . " " i do n't want you to talk
[555/1000]	' so , you liked music ? ' i asked . ' yes , very much . ' he said . i could tell he was having trouble believing it . ' how about you , how did
[556/1000]	" no . i meant to , but i could n't . " her eyes were still fastened on the road , but they drifted to him a time or two before she turned toward him again .
[557/1000]	" thanks , but there 's not enough left . i 'll wait for him in the car . " jack could see he was n't buying it , so he pressed his advantage . " okay , but
[558/1000]	i look up at him , my knees shaking . " you know ? " but he gives me a look so serious i know he 's not . " i did n't have time to figure it all
[559/1000]	what a relief . but after what the girls had said , it was n't nice . " well , thanks , " savannah said . " but do n't expect all my friends to want to come along
[560/1000]	" who ? " asked kevin . " do i know you from somewhere ? " " no , i 'm sorry , but i think we 've met before , " said rachel . " we have the
[561/1000]	" what is your problem , blake ? seriously - " " whoa , whoa ! i 'm not going to kick you out of my house through the hell with that shit . " his voice drops to
[562/1000]	" only his c * * k <EOS> if the word belongs to him . " in other words , what had been doing to my insides without words ? i looked at him , puzzled and excited at
[563/1000]	" well , i need to use that as evidence . " she tried to sound coy . " to what degree ? " she shot him an exasperated look . " a one - two punch
[564/1000]	" i do n't like that . a lot anyway . " " so , a lot of new things have happened while you were away . " he smiled a little , but there was a hint of
[565/1000]	" i would love to . " " okay . i 'll leave you to it then . " the smile slid away from her lips and she shook her head as if she could n't bring herself
[566/1000]	i had my gun in my pocket . i knew we could always do this . i had no reason to be afraid , although it had just occurred to me , that the pistol in my waistband was something
[567/1000]	" they 're not worth the risk over , " said wodan . " your loss . " " kill me ! " said the man with the knife . " i 'm not about to , "
[568/1000]	" of course , " he said again . chapter thirty - two there was only one thing that jack could do by himself while sitting in the middle of his bedroom . but he could figure out
[569/1000]	another explosion went off in the distance and she jumped back , bumping into gage . i was going to grab the door for support or something when the flash of a flash of red in her left eye ,
[570/1000]	" not her ? " she raised her head to see that he 'd moved closer , too , but when she saw that his eyes were closed , she realized it was n't one of her imaginings -
[571/1000]	it dawned on her after only a short while that this was the first time jake had had an opportunity to take a blood sample . he 'd never talked much about being strigoi , but it was obvious before
[572/1000]	" i 'm sorry i did n't talk to him . that 's all . " for one brief moment , everything became light . i was weightless and at peace . a sudden , overwhelming sensation gripped
[573/1000]	" what 's her name ? you know what i said . " " olivia . " he paused . " i mean , she 's not just a friend i lost . she 's my friend from the
[574/1000]	her mouth fell open . he would n't . " i 'm going to find a f * * king camera and tear it out of your ass . " she 'd never forget that look on
[575/1000]	" why not ? " " because i 'll just show up with a shovel . and if i try to fight them off , they 'll use the shovel like a weapon . and i do n't think
[576/1000]	a tall , thick - bodied man , his features hard and arrogant , a little too short to be called handsome , stepped out of the shadows and said , a gentle smile on his face , " the
[577/1000]	no , he had n't thought about that last night . why had he thought about it ? he remembered the vision , how it had struck him as odd that maybe he needed to wait until tomorrow , maybe
[578/1000]	he stopped his pacing and moved into the doorway , just a few steps away from her . " how was your first day , amy ? " he asked . " ok , why does everyone else
[579/1000]	" yes , " she agreed promptly . " if when we reach the city , we 'll be taking a carriage . " " do you wish to drive ? " " but ... " "
[580/1000]	that night i dreamt of a stranger , and it was dark . the image turned the room dark and i walked to a window and stepped out of the shadow . i had no clue where i was ,
[581/1000]	it was a large room , decorated after a period of time ( or something like that ) , its wide , floor - to - ceiling shelves filled with every kind of equipment and knickknacks . there were six
[582/1000]	" and when we 're through here we 'll be on the other side . go ! " " where - wait ! " " you wo n't know until you go , " she said , shoving him
[583/1000]	because i could n't think of anything but her or the ache that hummed in my body from her touch . " you brought me here . " she pressed to my chest , her shoulder under my arms
[584/1000]	" what do you call her ? " asked the general . " i call her what i see to be you . the lady of lies . " said dan , stepping into trayn 's mind .
[585/1000]	he nodded in acknowledgment at the woman . she drew in a breath , her gaze finding his . " i 'd seen your pictures , " she gasped . " yes . i work with the american
[586/1000]	" you 're a vampire , yes , but not in human terms , " said simon . isabelle stepped back , frowning . " is that a threat ? " " isabelle . " luke 's tone
[587/1000]	' ' tis mine ... and we are in your debt . if you care to come to the inn tonight , i will take good care of you , ' he replied . she stood up , swaying
[588/1000]	a look of dawning understanding entered his eyes and they turned to her . he was n't a patient man . he could give her a lesson or a verbal slap or even a little sexual rejection . he was
[589/1000]	she jumped like he 'd slapped her and stumbled back . " what is it ? is that you ? " tears poured down her cheeks as she reached out and touched my face . " you look the same
[590/1000]	the door was shut , the deadbolt unlocked , the wood boards had been warped and now rested in an even softer state of decay , but someone was doing the same thing there , with the same finesse ,
[591/1000]	he grabbed the water and slowly drank it down , feeling like he was being drained again as nothing else could have . water was nothing . i did n't ever think it enough against him to know after a
[592/1000]	i pulled back and looked up into his handsome face . he had those gray - blue eyes of his . they were kind . they were warm . they were kind . they were so much like my father
[593/1000]	the first hour was about how i treated the girls and i had to call myself off because i had always felt guilty by turning down a girl , i mean i had done it in the past when i
[594/1000]	" yeah , it 's the only way i 'll get a decent price , " i said . " let 's do it and get it over with . " we all sat down at the table .
[595/1000]	" i 'm perfectly alright , " he replied flatly . sam frowned and looked back at sam . " it kind of scares me that there 's this ... thing out there - i was just trying to
[596/1000]	" i am . i am your guide and protector - to the highest order . all worlds are mine by right . do you believe me ? " " i - i did . " she laughed .
[597/1000]	" if i say i 'm sure , do n't deny it . " she rolled into a ball on the sofa , exhausted but still grateful that at least she was n't wearing a dress . " so
[598/1000]	and just that quickly , the darkness of her mind reached out and grabbed hold of her . it grabbed all the memories of the night together . it had taken everything she had to pull her son away from
[599/1000]	' no . he 's a bloody idiot . and why did n't you tell me you 'd been at the university , anyway ? ' a pause . ' and did you think it was in connection

[601/1000]	" we can just wait , " the girl said . " nobody will ever come here . " " actually , i 'd prefer not to . " i 'm not coming with you , " i
[602/1000]	but it was n't just that . for the last seven years , she had never really fit in here . she knew that , and yet here she was , still a part of it . i do
[603/1000]	" well ? " she demanded . " if you 're going to go , i 'm going . " her voice lost its petu lance and became an insistent whine . " not right now , " he
[604/1000]	she felt a small bit of relief to see the grim expression on his face . yet if not for his presence , violet might 've been surprised at how grim he 'd looked , from his icy demeanor that
[605/1000]	" here we go again . " as i left the store , i noticed in front of a storefront a guy talking to a couple of girls . i walked back to the man on the phone .
[606/1000]	' ah , ah , here we are , my boys , ' whispered ver ence . ' we 're going to see which priest 's going to be responsible for the ' getting back ' . mr bucket is
[607/1000]	" what about my brother ? " i asked as i focused on the ocean of people across the way , trying to distract myself from my thoughts about my brother . " who ? " no good
[608/1000]	" ah ! " i say . i nearly topple backwards . " there is nothing else i can do though . if the attack comes , and it is imminent , you will be both vulnerable and vulnerable
[609/1000]	" no . i do n't have any choice . we need to run after him . " " at least a patrol will want to be close enough to take a shot , " alec replied . the
[610/1000]	" okay , " the boy said , letting out another sigh . " but there 's something <EOS> ... " and then he was in the air . without an ... an idiot , ryan , it
[611/1000]	she ran towards him and hugged him tightly . " i 'm okay , " she said into his chest . " i did n't see you . " " hey . " he squeezed her close . "
[612/1000]	" so what 's our option ? " said beth with a smile on her face . she felt she could already reach the meeting place and her heart started to beat furiously . " your chance of survival
[613/1000]	" this will be my last warning , because we are going to have great sex . you <EOS> , me , and both your partners in this time , but ... " the whole speech had been pure bravado
[614/1000]	" the president ? " " the vice president himself . " the old , balding man , whom she had met at a press conference , did n't say anything for quite a while , but it
[615/1000]	and if she gave in to his pleas , she would soon be at his mercy , the very thing she was sworn to never do again . the thought nearly made her weak as her body reacted like it
[616/1000]	" okay . i 'm meeting you here in five minutes , okay ? " " okay . " " hey , how did you get free passage ? " " i bought you something on your
[617/1000]	" do n't tell me not to . i 've got this . i 'll have it under control . " she gave him the information . " this is weird . " " it has to be
[618/1000]	" we need to find him , " she repeated under her breath , staring at the floor . " when my father finds out what you did , he 'll kill you . " " do n't worry
[619/1000]	" you did it . " max opened the door for me and showed me to my seat . " yeah , but i just messed up . i know it . " he sat down and tilted
[620/1000]	she 'd gotten so damn used to his hands on her . she did n't want to forget this time . she wanted to savor it . maybe this time would be different . she felt absolutely ... alive
[621/1000]	how was i supposed to deal with my grandmother ? " the car we bought for you is a dead giveaway , " dad said . " wow , " i echoed . and for once , i
[622/1000]	" your dad 's on it today . " i almost passed out . " my dad what ? " nick held it forward and then placed it on my bed . it was so heavy . "
[623/1000]	as the other vampires arrived they saw the bodies . their eyes almost glowed with anger and rage . darius walked toward his family members . " they deserve to die for killing your two best , " he

[627/1000]	he nodded and took off running , disappearing from view behind the counter . i turned to rush over to the door , trying to figure out what to do . was he pissed i had fallen so far
[628/1000]	" i saw your picture outside of your apartment , " he says . i gasp . how did he know ? " i keep my blinds shut , " i tell him . " i do n't even
[629/1000]	it was not a comforting feeling . i thought about the time in the past when i had been with the same man twice before . the truth was , i 'd barely gotten laid at all . "
[630/1000]	" you 're getting in my face . " and she smiled at him , but her pale brown eyes still held a tremor of fear . " thanks again for dinner even though i really did n't know
[631/1000]	it did not help much as she heard the others talking in low voices , talking of everything from the first attack to the king 's proposal to come . it must be a bad idea , she told
[632/1000]	' like , you know , if i lived there i 'd know it was mine ? " he smiled at her . " of course . where would you live ? " she ran one finger around
[633/1000]	" yes , sir . " the commander had said " yes . " but now he was at a loss as to what he thought . " she is free , " the emperor ordered .
[634/1000]	" i can see that , " replied clayton while waiting for his reply . so it was that clayton did not find captain foley sitting before him . that was not due in until next saturday to say
[635/1000]	jake smiled as a new chill tore through his gut , stealing his breath and making him look at her curiously . " yes . that 's what i said . i left you alone for a few days .
[636/1000]	i turned my back to him and faced the pool . " you 've been drinking . " i looked at the pool table and the bottle of water on it and waited for him to show the humor in
[637/1000]	" i thought you <EOS> , that 's good , like you did n't want to change . you 've been so cool . he thinks you 're a bitch . " " what have you learned , "
[638/1000]	" it is time for another move . we will take it from there . it is time we left this world ... or so we say . come , little one of us will need our wits about us
[639/1000]	* * * as soon as they had climbed to the platform they all sat and stretched out their legs . a dozen of the prisoners , bound in the usual fashion with twine , stood about around one
[640/1000]	i nodded again . i had no idea if i should tell him what happened . i did n't want to just bring it up . i had a feeling it would take some time for him to accept it
[641/1000]	" well , actually , we have a problem . a lot of bad things have happened here that are far more terrible than this place ever could be . " " yes , we all have nightmares ,
[642/1000]	he was n't going to get the opportunity to say those words . she knew what he meant . because when all you had was this moment , this knowledge and this wish - to , you have waited your
[643/1000]	" i have no idea what he 's talking about . " " have you ever witnessed a man in his power ? " " um ... i do n't understand what you mean , " she answered
[644/1000]	this had the effect of weakening my resolve . now that i had come into full control of my body , i could push past this feeling of terror and rage and focus instead on getting myself out . soon
[645/1000]	one of her hands pushed the covers away and she leaned across the bed to kiss his lips gently . " are you sure you want me back here with you ? i 'm still not sure that i

[647/1000]	and the thing that really shocked them was that charlie was giving me her virginity , all off to some unknown , nameless , weird , and utterly un trustworthy mr. mo len a ar from the third dimension .
[648/1000]	i was n't ready to ask my dad about any of that right then . i knew what i would make of him one day . well , not really in the same way he would make me feel for

[654/1000]	i sat back , almost knocking me down . i was staring straight ahead . my heart was pounding . my breathing was suddenly uneven . what was going on ? why was i feeling so unsettled ? i tried
[655/1000]	he shrugged <EOS> a bit , knowing i was going to stay behind him . ' are we ready to get in again ? ' i continued . ' perhaps the first round seems to be a little bit
[656/1000]	" it 's nothing . " she gave him a puzzled look that seemed to require no explanation . " is what anything ? " he asked , his tone as inquisitive as his fingers had been a minute
[657/1000]	i was walking toward the truck when my phone started to ring . i reached in my pocket and saw that i had a missed call from megan . i answered it . " hello , " i said
[658/1000]	" does n't matter , " he said . " there are n't any girls at school other than me . " " you do n't even have a girlfriend , actually . " " for god 's
[659/1000]	" your girl just made up this story , and this is good and true , all around perfect . so now i think this little girl will grow into a beautiful man . " " when is he
[660/1000]	" go away , " he said , and the darkness took his voice . she followed the steady trickle of his footsteps down the walkway , noting his unsteady gait as he hurried . she had been standing
[661/1000]	" okay . " he waited until i was out of earshot before speaking again . " what 's the deal with you and noah ? " i thought about telling him about how noah was n't my dog
[662/1000]	he pulled me to him , and i tried to pull away from him , but i was so surprised i fell into his arms , and his lips crushed mine . we kissed , and as we did
[663/1000]	" i do n't want to find out . let 's get out of here . " they got in the jeep and alex drove them to the nearest sheriff 's office . he was the sheriff of fort
[664/1000]	he took a step back . " how many people are on this floor ? " " all of them . " " you see in this room like this ? " he pointed to the empty floor
[665/1000]	i smiled and walked over to him . i slipped my arms around him , kissing him softly . " better . do you have to stay inside ? it sounds so small from up here . " "
[666/1000]	" i told you to watch the paper , " he said . " i do n't want to . " " i want to know why you did n't call me back earlier . " "
[667/1000]	" my father calls this ' the golden goose ' , " said sir francis winston . " well , in either case , " he continued , " you know a good soul can be really wicked .
[668/1000]	another explosion followed with another thunderous crack and the earth rolled downwards . " oh my god , i 'm scared . " anna held on and as she felt the shaking turn into the quaking it was
[669/1000]	" you 've only found me once and i 've already lost my appetite for the life . you came here to tell me you 're pregnant . " " the time has come . " " when
[670/1000]	" no , i want to know exactly what 's going on with our daughter . " he took a swig of beer , and leaned back against the kitchen counter . " i 've got plans to take

[674/1000]	' and you know what 's in the bag ? ' she asked with a smile that was forced that evening . ' yes , " i have a secret to share , " by the way . did
[675/1000]	and there was something very important that the president 's daughter was supposed to have ... oh , and a note of caution ; the word " suicide " should have had more to do with those items used

[679/1000]	" that would be nice and all , " said mr. bun dy , rolling his eyes but , oddly , not moving an inch . " so , if you do n't mind , we could , uh
[680/1000]	" a woman too . " that was n't good enough for me . " you 're only supposed to do what i want you to do . " with my hand on his chest on the way
[681/1000]	" oh , " she said , giving another small giggle . " because i am wearing an amazing blouse and matching skirt . and my heels .... " what ? i just stared at her .
[682/1000]	before julia could say anything more , the door opened silently and the man he 'd approached was standing in front of her . " what the hell are you doing here ? " oh no . he
[683/1000]	why do i ask her about something i 've never asked about her ? it 's all because of sam . it 's the thing that 's complicated . i shrug . " just a hunch . her
[684/1000]	" i 'm good . " i knew he had to be before he was ready . that was why i was standing around the pool and not getting in . sometimes you just ca n't find the door handle
[685/1000]	" yeah , you just ca n't deal with it . it 's like a bad habit . like the one that happened of course . " he sighed again and i was starting to worry about why he was
[686/1000]	" i remember you were a close friend of my grandmother . i 'm sorry about those two . " " you do n't have to apologize . " " perhaps we should go talk to your girlfriend
[687/1000]	" oh right , " she said absently . she looked at me like i 'd just said the stupidest thing ever . i thought , when it came to this girl , i was always going to hurt
[688/1000]	" the second thing is , i heard from my mom . she was crying , and i 'm right here behind her , but i know that there is nothing i could have done . plus , i 'm

[690/1000]	by the time they 'd left the forest and hit the soft , white , powdery area of the forest , they were almost at their destination . the trees continued on for a very little longer . "
[691/1000]	" i have . there 's information and i need it , " i demanded as i walked up to them and pressed down on the button . i heard the sound of an electric whine as a machine started

[694/1000]	" how is this possible ? " i whispered . " all of you ? " i took a deep breath ... and then another one . the room moved with a great swirl of green light and i
[695/1000]	" you do n't make anymore cookies ? " " if you thought i baked them to your liking , you would n't be here . " sarah knew that . but it was still weird to be
[696/1000]	" you can talk , you know . " " but i can not go to the doctor . " he shrugged . " if i take a look , he wo n't answer anything you say .
[697/1000]	" they all go through their first - time trial now , " said the detective , and then turned to the girl he had been examining . " do you know what happened to the girl ? "

[700/1000]	" thank you . " i was n't sure if he was thanking me for saving his life or for saving my life . i did n't care . it seemed irrelevant now . " seriously , i 'm sorry
[701/1000]	" a bit of a dick , all my life . " aidan snorted . " i 'm not judging you . you have good genes . " " you 're an ass , " aidan grumbled .
[702/1000]	" i want it . " she lifted the sheet . the heat of his chest pressed against her back , and goose bumps rose on her arms . he 'd asked not to touch her . cadence
[703/1000]	" do n't worry about it . someone will come pick me up . " " no , you can stay at the apartment . i 'll get my things together , " he said . " what
[704/1000]	" what 's up , bro , " i murmured . " i 'm not even sure who 's the better - lookin ' of you on this tour ? " for some reason i knew better than to question
[705/1000]	before he could respond , max had moved out from the bed . " i think that 's everything for the evening . i have a date with a lovely woman , " he said , sending max 's
[706/1000]	" you 've got to let us take you in instead , " said the other guard . their voices became familiar , but it was the way they spoke that bothered me , not their accent . "
[707/1000]	" then where do i go ? " " we do n't know that . " " you mean i stay here , with you all day . " " we do n't know that . "

[709/1000]	" with us , " he said simply , staring at the floor , at the floor and the empty wine bottles . something was wrong . something really , really wrong . " we have to do something
[710/1000]	<EOS> she sat alone in her hotel room , holding the sheet tighter around her . it had grown hot today and reminded her of how hot it had been the night before . how everything had just ended .

[714/1000]	maybe he was n't the one . and when it came to him , he just did n't know . " just do n't forget that you do n't have to worry about hurting anyone else , " he
[715/1000]	" you might start walking again , but you 're not going anywhere . " we walked together toward the lake , which was exactly where i had hoped to see the lake . " we do n't

[717/1000]	" no , we do n't , " sam said slowly . " did you have anything to do with that ? " sam shrugged . " what do you mean ? " " did you know
[718/1000]	" the fact that he was with you , the fact he 's always in the club even though we 've been away for a month , " tate said . " he mentioned sex . " "
[719/1000]	" the boy , " he whispers , " his father - i was told he was on a business trip . i had no idea . " he looks almost as if he 's about to cry .
[720/1000]	" your face looks terrible , " said charlie . " i 've spent my entire childhood in a wheelchair so there 's no way this is possible for me to look horrible ! " " how much
[721/1000]	" oh , no , " she said , giggling like a schoolgirl . " i wanted to say : i was sure there would n't be any trouble . for you anyway . " he felt an ominous
[722/1000]	" why ? because i 'm a dumb bitch ? " i was angry and angry at the same time , but i did n't care . " i 'm just as stupid as your dad was . but he
[723/1000]	" that is a very strange choice . " " yes . it is in the nature of a very weird choice , " james replied , looking at emily now . " <EOS> back in the country .

[728/1000]	" not ' til i know that you are n't in danger . ' " he felt her tighten against him and it was so welcome , he froze . " what ? " " no reason i
[729/1000]	" i 've even noticed how different you are from me . " she does n't have that easy glow to her like i do , but i also have n't had this many people in the past two years
[730/1000]	" i 'll work it out . " " come on , mary , you 've talked to the lawyer . " " and i 'll work it out when we get back . " jack took
[731/1000]	i ca n't , i thought . it would be a great start . then i mentally forced the image off my brain and decided that this was the whole point of the day . so i typed ,

[733/1000]	" let 's find some more suitable materials . " " yes ma'am . " they continued going and came to the same end he had come to the night before . " i ca n't walk
[734/1000]	" sure . like you did before ? we 're talking about the past . " i asked . " it 's on your mind now . it 's more sensitive to us than the past . "
[735/1000]	" uh , yeah , they 're our family . " " there 's an island just north of here that you can stay at for as long as you want . " jim told her . "
[736/1000]	" i do n't , " he whispered as his tongue circled the side of my sex with devastating force . i buried my face in his hair and moaned as he continued his torturous assault until finally ,

[738/1000]	she gasped and did a quick double take . it felt ... familiar . her bedroom was small , with a small desk and a single bed close by . no door . just her bed . but it
[739/1000]	" of course you 're right . i am only saying that all we have to do is wait for another year . it might take years to have the results back . " " so you still think
[740/1000]	" damn . i wish i had n't left you at home alone . " " why were you there ? " " why did you throw your phone away ? " he asks me . "
[741/1000]	i ignored the way it made me want to punch him in the gut . " how late ? " i asked , pulling out my phone and texting the time so quickly i could be a minute late .
[742/1000]	i ignored him . " i am willing to take a chance with you , " he said in a smooth voice . " just once , " he said urgently , " does that do it ? "
[743/1000]	" do n't . " his voice sounded oddly metallic in his own ears . he reached forward , but stopped when she gently turned away from him . " why , for your benefit ? " she asked
[744/1000]	i glanced sideways at her . i ca n't read her expression , but it looks blank , blank , and kind of scary . " how can people who have been dead for the last few years just
[745/1000]	" yeah ? " he thought over her words , nodded , and then moved back to the bike . " take my bike , " he said . " it can be like this all night . no

[747/1000]	" maybe he had the wrong idea about everything . the rest of us , though ... we can work with this . " in truth , the doctor would n't think so . at least that was what
[748/1000]	" then , of course , you want to stay , or you really will be staying here ? " " maybe not if you 're serious about being an artist , but this ... you are important to
[749/1000]	" thanks . not as simple as the idea of keeping kids , but that 's how it 's been done so far . " " yeah , but we 're using condoms , right ? " she patted
[750/1000]	" oh , come on , do n't be so emotional ! " she exclaimed , her voice a little more shrill . " i 'll be so much more efficient a replacement when we find him . "
[751/1000]	" yes , " he said very quietly . " i 'm afraid she turned on him . i came to see if you were still in there . " her head had gone spinning . why was n't
[752/1000]	i did , and was amazed she made it any further before collapsing to the floor with a soft <EOS> a sigh . ' please do you have a mind - do you not ? ' again it
[753/1000]	" the whole family ? " " yes . there is a large family . " " who ? where are they all staying ? what are they like ? what else have you promised them ? "
[754/1000]	but did i ? what did it mean ? could my intentions really just have been good ? one thing was clear to me : if i wanted to move forward and move on , i was going to have
[755/1000]	" please you do n't even try to act tough , " i snapped , not able to contain my anger . " what is taking so long ? " the men exchanged a secret look , and another
[756/1000]	she nods , keeping her face serious . " i knew you 'd have the answers you needed . is there anything else you need to know about what they would do to the world if they ever got their
[757/1000]	" who , john ? " " my parents . i should go , to talk to them . i just want it all out so i can say good - bye to them good - bye . "
[758/1000]	" all of it , " she breathed as she looked up at him . <EOS> by her . " what in the shower . " that was when he 'd told her that it was pure
[759/1000]	" you know , you should have told me the exact same thing , " i told him . " and i should have told you the same shit . you know what ? i was so caught up
[760/1000]	you and i , we , we 've done everything you could . all the while , she had wondered what was doing that man to him . what it was why she never called . what she never
[761/1000]	" i think not . " " why do you think not ? " the girl asked . " i do not know about how . he was ... well , i wonder . " " he
[762/1000]	" okay . " " i 'll think about it . " that was a promise . i had a feeling that if i did n't have anything else to do , i 'd have to think about what
[763/1000]	" this is n't an accident , " jake said . " it might be important . " " you 're a psychologist , " jake said . " can you tell me anything that would help us
[764/1000]	" you okay ? " grace asked . i was n't sure if ethan was asking about her and i did n't know how to answer him anyway . " great ! " i said brightly . she
[765/1000]	" oh , you , too ? " beth asked and her tone was one of surprise . " is n't it amazing ? no one ever got to see you with your hair down and an apron on
[766/1000]	" let 's hope it 's enough . " as she placed the receiver back in its cradle , <EOS> hand was gripping her lower abdomen again . her hand had taken on the mantle ; it seemed she
[767/1000]	then his hands were over hers and he hauled her closer . " what the f * * k ? " he clipped . " you were in bed before christ ever touched you . " " oh
[768/1000]	" that 's one hell of a job ! " " and this , i 'm sure , has given our country an opportunity that we sorely need . " " i still do n't see how you
[769/1000]	" no . she 's not a monster , " she said , looking back up at us with her lovely eyes . " are you sure about that ? " i would never , ever use the word
[770/1000]	" here 's how it 's going to dance . " " how 's that ? " " i believe you 've made it clear that you do n't seem to be aware of the significance of your
[771/1000]	" yes ? " the door swung open . " dr. talbot ? " there it was again . her heart . it had begun again . her mind started ticking over . " come in . "
[772/1000]	" that 's the big - city types . " i was glad she had n't mentioned that i was a pretty badass . " what 's your name ? " she asked . " oh , i
[773/1000]	he was wearing a pair of cargo pants in what he took to be an outfit , complete with a tank top and pair of loose fitting converse , and a dark brown windbreaker . his shirt and jacket were
[774/1000]	it felt so damned good to be feeling at this point . he felt safe . completely at ease in his own skin . every cell in his body was attuned to her , waiting for the moment when
[775/1000]	" i 'm glad you 're back . i miss you , " he finally tells me . " i miss you too . talk about awkward . " he laughs . " well , we got ta
[776/1000]	she felt a sudden urge to tell his parents that she was going for a walk . it was n't that she had n't wanted to , but something about the way his father 's expression turned from astonishment to
[777/1000]	" i would n't put it past him to send you there alone . " sam 's eyes snapped open . at least he knew she would n't be alone . i came on to you , he
[778/1000]	" does n't matter what he does or does n't do . but anyway , he ca n't be an angel . he can only be human . " " so he does have a soul and that means
[779/1000]	" why do n't you go find emma and have her try to start packing ? " he nodded then looked me over , frowning a little . " you feeling all right ? " " fine .
[780/1000]	he threw back his head and screamed as he finally came inside , and i felt his body relax as he took his seed deeper . somehow , i knew he would never forget the feel of that hot pulsing
[781/1000]	' this is n't the time . ' ' i do n't want to talk . ' she watched him closely , but he was n't about to look up . an old bird might have been able
[782/1000]	" i 'm good . " john did n't seem to care about his bruises . " the old woman , the one who attacked me on the stairs , was standing with her back to me . i thought
[783/1000]	" that was my intention , as well , " he said . " this has to be the end of the war as far as we 're concerned . " " you ca n't control this ? "
[784/1000]	" you know we do . " " then answer my question , dammit ! " " first , what you said about not calling your daughter and picking her up . " he glanced at the front
[785/1000]	one second the small room was empty and i was staring into another room . i was n't sure whether to turn , to watch him or be afraid . a tiny part of me wanted to turn , to
[786/1000]	' my turn ! ' he whispered . <EOS> damn him right now to hell . the heat from his voice had created a kind of heat that still sent goose bumps up her arms and spread through her .
[787/1000]	nick grinned . " in that case , i 'm not a serial killer . but i am a good person . " he paused and looked at him . " you can trust me , too . if i
[788/1000]	" only when it comes to this kind of stuff . " he paused . " which would be a lot more than you 've endured so far . you 've had your fair share of tragedy . i just
[789/1000]	" what do you mean ? " she made a grab for them without looking back , but he could tell she felt his finger on the trigger before she finally turned around . " there 's something about
[790/1000]	as we approach the car the night - time lights of the place start to come on , all in order to show the night - time beauty that they are the beauties of paris . they are both a
[791/1000]	" no ! " the soldier was trying to pull his hands free , but the other one held them fast . " no one will ever be able to remove my knife from your throat , will they
[792/1000]	three weeks later , the last of the employees packed up , leaving behind the boxes of books , papers , and other files that lay abandoned throughout the building . back in his office , i glanced around
[793/1000]	" me too . " she did . it stung . she loved being with him , too . he surprised her , seeing as he was used to women running from him and yet , he had n't given
[794/1000]	" she 's sleeping , " mike said , " that 's all . " " the kids are with her . " " that 's only because they 're here to help . i told you ,
[795/1000]	i pushed it open . inside was a black - and - white picture of a child , in jeans and a denim jacket . the same body . i 'd seen that image two times already . it
[796/1000]	" i wish i could talk to you , but i ca n't , " said jill , grabbing his arm . " i just ca n't . they 're taking me away . they 're taking the house .
[797/1000]	" they 're quite good , i can see . they must have some extra - rich blood . " " that 's true enough . all those things he 's showing us here in ar gos . how
[798/1000]	" good girl . you were always my favorite thing , " he said , gazing at the picture . his voice was so throaty - rough and hoarse , and the rasp in his voice made her shiver .
[799/1000]	" thank you , " i said , not knowing why i said it , and he gave me an easy " i like you " smile . " what about you ? " he was still staring as
[800/1000]	it appears to me , from many of his actions , that this man , the same as his former self , is a master at his games of the round table , although i can not see this so
[801/1000]	" this all seems so convenient , " i say , just to shut anyone up . " like i was suddenly gon na disappear into thin air and you could n't find me on facebook or something . something
[802/1000]	nick looked surprised . " you want to leave ? " " yes . " the expression on his face remained that of a hurt child , and kate felt like a heel already . but this was
[803/1000]	i put my hand on the small of his back and pulled them up . his back muscles contracted under my palms . ' you 've been so cold lately , ' i said . for the first time
[804/1000]	" what ? " " you like him . " i laugh . " i do , but he 's really messed up . " " i 'm not getting into that , " she says .
[805/1000]	" i think you can . " but again , she says nothing , only gazes at her hands on the table . <EOS> if i do n't let me watch in town . she stays up
[806/1000]	" yeah , " sam sighed , " we did n't know where to go , and we did n't know what to do after losing the bus and all ... but i think we figured we had a shot
[807/1000]	she met my gaze as we neared the stairs . " go back , then " - she pointed toward the door - " but do n't get any ideas . if you have something to say , think it
[808/1000]	" i will not give your daughter to a man . ever ! " " do n't believe that , father . i was born here . i have been taught my place in the family . "
[809/1000]	" so ... have you told her yet ? " she pulled her head from his chest . " i 'm doing it this time . " and that was the extent of it . then there
[810/1000]	" it did n't seem to work too well . " i took a deep breath and let it out . " it did n't hurt that much , either . it did hurt a bit , though .
[811/1000]	the wind of the forest blew in , ruffling my hair , so i had to do something constructive with it . even the tree branches rustled . some of us laughed a little at the joke , feeling
[812/1000]	" what 's he thinking ? " " he 'll never let me out of the house again . he 'll burn my house down with him if he tries to take me . " " well ,
[813/1000]	" why do you think that is ? " she gave him the strangest gaze , and he felt only utter contempt . she started to rise , and he grabbed her by the arm . "
[814/1000]	but it could n't help but be a big freaking deal . " i 'll call you when i land . " he clicked off and tossed the phone on the console beside his head . *
[815/1000]	that was what he liked about her . she was n't weak and insecure . she had dignity and intelligence . she could walk up to a situation , even in her position as someone 's wife , the way
[816/1000]	it goes before that . and the story of our fight is not the one we 've told our readers . it 's the story of us . " take a look , " noah announced as soon
[817/1000]	it took a few more rounds to get through to the last man and they knew where they were . she gave a soft sob . the men were n't talking . they had to be talking .
[818/1000]	a white car pulled into a courtyard from the opposite direction . its lights were on and red light reflected off its window . the big glass doors slid open and a tall , lanky man stepped outside . he
[819/1000]	" i wonder who is responsible for these murders ? " " to question a man like that deserves a nice bonus , my lady . " " i 'd be extra careful , then , if i
[820/1000]	it was n't quite a lie . i 'd barely spoken to him much , but i 'd noticed something more in his eyes . they 'd been quiet , at first , but then he 'd seemed to see
[821/1000]	no one had actually attempted to turn us into toads yet , but a few months after the divorce , the neighbors reported that a strange man named jason had gotten into their yard one night long after the residents
[822/1000]	" do you speak in riddles ? " he countered coldly . " or do i ask your name this time ? " " i do , " she emphasized . " very well . in that case
[823/1000]	" if my blood is in you , then yes . when you 're through with me , remember that . " when is she getting out ? i stared at her in shock as the room grew
[824/1000]	" your turn . " he smiles at me . " i ca n't handle going through my stuff again . the idea of going into that room takes a f * * king vacation . " i start
[825/1000]	the girl took the glass from me and stood , grabbing the bottle from my hand . " thanks for everything , kiera . " she looked over to denny and gave him a hug . kellan and anna were
[826/1000]	" get rid of them , " the knight stated . " i have a feeling your orders would be to kill them , " the king said from the corner . his silver visor was lowered a little
[827/1000]	" she 's a girl who wo n't stop . she really seemed convinced she was capable of being a good woman . " this was the type of talk he had thought he 'd avoided on his return
[828/1000]	" did n't you just teach me that lesson ? " " yeah , i did . i just thought it was a good lesson for you . " " but you said it was better to be
[829/1000]	and now i feel truly wretched . the thought of me to blame but me knowing , in my heart , that i have done such a nasty thing to deserve it keeps replaying in my mind . but i
[830/1000]	" what do you mean , ' what do you take me for ? ' " she asked . he smiled . " as a rule , i like the wild , free , free girl he 'd drawn
[831/1000]	he gave no response to that either . what he said next made her lose hope , so she could only hope her actions and thoughts would be coherent . a man in a business suit walked past
[832/1000]	" you 've taken to drinking too much , " i observed as he struggled to force himself to take a full couple of heavy breaths . " and you look like you 're about ready to collapse . "
[833/1000]	" for the record , " i whispered back , " i want to know why you want to know why i 'm here . " " and you need to understand why i 'm here . " his
[834/1000]	" wait , you 're going to tell me you never slept with another male before . and now you are telling me you were with him while i do n't know ? where is he now ? " i
[835/1000]	but the new . " you know what , then ? " i was n't sure i wanted to talk about them . " maybe i 'm not quite ready to meet them . maybe i have responsibilities here
[836/1000]	he went back to putting the last of the garbage away , and i turned a corner and saw the office . he 'd left the door open . i pushed my way in , closing the door behind
[837/1000]	he was n't in his room . her home smelled like him , the scent of him that was always there . one that always seemed to exist . she took a deep breath . the smoke in her
[838/1000]	" you did n't . " damn right i did n't . he and i were different that way . but damn him , he was still at my side even at this pace . when we 'd left
[839/1000]	" i think i like whatever you tell us . " " you were n't in hell , " quinn told him . " you 're back in the human world . " " true , " he
[840/1000]	he was n't sure his reaction was one of anger and shame . the next day , the crew took a break with a break from the ocean . they took time to eat their dinner for the first
[841/1000]	i looked with disbelief at al the blood red patches of his skin on his cheeks . he lifted his head to look at al - seeing . " was he there ? the witch - i mean , that
[842/1000]	" and when i do that , the men will be on the watch , " said de vries . " i 'll leave you to tend to your hair . " " my hair ? " latham looked
[843/1000]	" wait , " emma protested . " let me see if i understand this correctly . " mrs. mercer turned to face laurel . " she 's a laurel now . " for a moment , emma
[844/1000]	he lifted his eyebrows and smiled , sending her into a giggle attack . " maybe we both need the stress , can you imagine what the media feels like when we tell them we 're engaged ? it 'll
[845/1000]	ryan stared at the man . he recognized him as one of the first things he 'd noticed about him : he had n't changed much in the last eight years , to give ryan a reason to believe he
[846/1000]	the air was warm , but it smelled good . i sniffed the air . to my right were the water bottles and bottles of shampoo and conditioner i 'd seen at the store , and hanging on the wall
[847/1000]	" she does love you ! " his eyes flashed and i sighed . " i know . thanks for everything , grant . " " anytime . i just need you to know that in the days
[848/1000]	the door next to the desk opened , and someone stepped out . " hello ? " asked a confused receptionist . " is this mr. james bond ? my name is leslie , and i 'm from dallas
[849/1000]	" you 're mine ! " she screamed at him , spittle spitting from her mouth . she turned toward damien , and started shoving him and shoving , trying to get him to stay inside . " i 'll
[850/1000]	" and , like you , i always have a bit of darkness inside . my family has a lot of darkness inside of them , too . they get ... emotional . for some reason , we 're always
[851/1000]	he did not even try to block her again , and she reached out a hand to touch his face , drawing his smile closer as it curved softly into her palm . her throat turned suddenly dry , and
[852/1000]	" i 'm not taking that chance , " i 'd said , and looked around the crowd . i could n't see an ounce of red or green in the sea of pinks and pur ples that surrounded us
[853/1000]	" that 's not cool , i need to explain this to someone who has me confused . " he grabbed my wrist and pulled me closer to him . " listen to me . we are right now in
[854/1000]	the same one who 'd tried to hurt her a year before ? she wanted to ask , but she did n't . that was just selfish . in fact , her best friend was doing that already .
[855/1000]	" oh , honey . " elizabeth stroked my cheek , soothing me . " sweetie , we do n't need you up running for the homecoming court anymore . you 're a part of this family now . "
[856/1000]	" the only person inside these walls who has ever used those words is you . " " are n't you the one who said that it 's easier to believe in your own shadow than to be seen
[857/1000]	he 's breathing too hard , in too deep . i begin to feel nervous and i 'm not sure if it 's from arousal or from the idea of him touching me . i 'm not sure any of
[858/1000]	" then they want him . " i ca n't believe i am hearing this . " do they kill people ? " " they do not . " " how many people do you kill ?
[859/1000]	" well , i need a word with you , son . " " go ahead . " " i have been thinking . " he spoke his words around a mouthful of beer . " about
[860/1000]	" no he 's not , ma'am . but i know what you told me , and that 's why he 's here . i know who you are ; i need to know . " " go ahead
[861/1000]	a series of explosions shook the tree trunk only feet away from her . she jumped once -- just as two feet of tree trunk came barreling toward her . the branch stuck in her chest , but it held
[862/1000]	his laugh was a cold rumble that sent a shiver of excitement through her system , and damn , he looked good . " thanks . i 'm glad i could help . " " it 's a little
[863/1000]	" not much in the way of physical power . i 've often had a feeling that there was more to it , something that was controlling the magic flow from you . something that was trying to stay out
[864/1000]	" i do ? " she was amazed to hear the sound and texture of his voice . " then they would have done what , when ? " " you would n't know . it was in the
[865/1000]	she took a deep cleansing breath and said , " after yesterday 's outburst , i must ask that you respect me as a friend and take me seriously . " then she stopped , put her finger to her
[866/1000]	" to buy from me , " the young man replied in a strange accent . all of my money had gone to his name , his ability to raise his brother alive . for his part they did not
[867/1000]	" you and your son will be spending the night here . that wo n't be pleasant , " he replies . it is a dismissal . so , i follow him out , leaving one of the women
[868/1000]	another voice behind him said , " did you tell him how pretty she is ? " david turned . his gaze seemed to catch the other man when he rounded a corner , but by that time david
[869/1000]	" i know something about that . " " yes ? " " you have to get word to your buddies . " tom did not like that one bit . he said , " why ?
[870/1000]	i sat in my desk chair and looked up at him . " okay . i 'll help you find that band . i 'll send mike to go find you when you 're ready . " we talked
[871/1000]	" well , maybe , if i knew how to talk to people , " i admit , my heart sinks . " i guess i 'll just be in touch ? " seth looks so forlorn and conflicted
[872/1000]	" the problem with that is i ca n't get my hands on your body . " her breath rose with emotion . " ca n't ? oh , no . i 'd rather it worked for you .
[873/1000]	" no , that 's not it . that 's just how it is . " she looked crestfallen . when she realized he was n't going to elaborate , her face lit up with enthusiasm . " my
[874/1000]	" thank you , " she snapped back . " you 're welcome . " " where else can i get a ride ? how about your local ? i need a ride home . i 'm a
[875/1000]	the lady in black , the one who wore all gray , stood by . she looked like a queen , a queen of the black . even without the silver lining , she stood above him , her face
[876/1000]	it 's a perfect day for a movie , and i 'm so glad i decided to come over tonight . after another eight calls <EOS> so - i 'll never get out , until i think of the fun
[877/1000]	this time , he got up and grabbed his clothing off the floor and returned to the bed . he took her hand when she was n't awake and put it on his chest . " wait here ,
[878/1000]	" oh , yeah . i always remember a new customer . " " this is all new , is n't it ? all the new clients , the new uniforms and the beautiful furniture , is going on
[879/1000]	" you 've worked all along , " he whispered . anger bubbled , and all she could think of was that he was going to pay for this . " i could n't work a better salary .
[880/1000]	with only a single thought , my mind had come to a different conclusion . that everything i had thought we shared was just a figment of my brain and nothing more . despite the fact that it had felt
[881/1000]	" no problem . " he shrugged . " hey , can we ride to the opera ? " " oh , sure . with just these two ? thanks . i 'm going to grab a soda
[882/1000]	" i 'm fine . " logan pulled me a slight distance from him and looked into my eyes . " now that i have you in my arms , i feel happy . " " i 'm sorry
[883/1000]	i let out an empty exhale . " fuck no ! you 're right . " i was ready to fight , really i was - and there was too damned much at stake for that . i 'd
[884/1000]	" she 's dead now , " eddie said . " i 'm not sure that 's true , " wireman said ; he was back in the shadows . " here 's another piece of me that 's
[885/1000]	her hand , warm and sensitive , cradled his chin and gazed down at him . " you like me , do n't you ? " he did . to her , a guy was nothing bad .
[886/1000]	she pulled away with a gasp . " what the hell are you doing ? " my head did n't want to clear . " i hate you , " i whispered back . she stepped back and
[887/1000]	" i can understand you not wanting to kill him , but do not blame yourself , " she said with a weak smile . " i wo n't ever be human again , " she said and it
[888/1000]	" that 's much better , " said the director after a short pause . " now let 's go watch the replay of the replay . " there 's something else . " a pause . " when
[889/1000]	in the last half hour , he 'd been the captain of the king 's guard and was once again the crown prince , the only member of his family with any regard to the throne . this he
[890/1000]	i had a hard time believing that when you could have someone you loved to come home , you really gave up on me . i hated the thought of losing her . i pushed the thought aside
[891/1000]	" you do n't want to ? " my heart went out to him . i 'd never truly known him . " i do n't . " he shook his head sadly . " i do n't want
[892/1000]	" what ? " " i 've been calling you for hours , " he growled , suddenly back to being irritated . his voice was raw with frustration and i smiled up at him , thankful for his
[893/1000]	" not even close . " " that 's good . " i was surprised at the excitement in her voice . " but i 'm not sure why they sent you . " " i saw
[894/1000]	then his hand covered hers , holding her palm to his . " i know what we have is better than what they have , but that does n't mean that 's how our marriage is going to work .
[895/1000]	the last of its breath disappeared . its eyes widened . its cheeks turned red . <EOS> - its jaw clenched . it had the look of hunger , hunger to a rage . " that was something else
[896/1000]	i nodded . " i saw it . from the tower . " " and ? " " and i think we should stay and find out . " he smiled . " i know you think
[897/1000]	" i can not bear these thoughts . my father was a man . if he had waited we should have seen an opportunity to marry and produce heirs . " his father was even now , and would
[898/1000]	but he would need to get the info soon before they figured out his plan . with a shake of his head as if he had thoughts of his own , he put a knee to the desk and

[917/1000]	" wait here . " he ran to the bathroom and quickly covered the windows as he returned to the kitchen . " we do n't have long . " the sounds of a generator blasted through the walls
[918/1000]	" are you the one i 'm supposed to be studying for ? " she asked , feigning interest so she could get up and go find the girls to take home . " you 're looking for them
[919/1000]	" you want another one ? " he asked , winking at her . " yes . " she did n't want to miss a second of the song they were dancing to but she 'd said she would

[924/1000]	" yes . he 's wonderful , " she said , her face warming under his inquisitive gaze and teasing smile . she was trying , but that was n't the same as actually telling a man you like him

[926/1000]	for the past four hours , he 'd been staring at his laptop , his mind racing . this had to be the beginning of a nightmare . another chill hit him as he reached into his pocket
[927/1000]	" all right , then ; how do i get out ? " " it 's simple . " he looked down and rubbed his right hand across the back of his head before standing up and pushing his
[928/1000]	" i miss you , too , " he said , suddenly breaking down completely . " how could you miss me ? " they turned together to face each other and in the small space it afforded

[982/1000]	" i never want to talk to you again . " the kiss lingered like that , long enough for daisy to be tempted to push the man away . the sweet taste of his mouth was intoxicating .
