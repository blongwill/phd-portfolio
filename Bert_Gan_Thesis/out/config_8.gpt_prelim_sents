[1/1000]	i should have known he 'd have the answers . " we were in the neighborhood and stopped by to pick up the house , " i said quietly , because being in his company again was like being with
[2/1000]	the elevator ride to the second floor came in the blink of an eye . they stepped out of the elevator onto the open floor . the air smelled of fresh paint and fresh paint . the hallways had been
[3/1000]	at the airport , they were greeted and then the plane was flying home . by the time they were up on the flight base , ryan had done the entire flight and was having his pilot take them through
[4/1000]	" why would they send me as the god king 's son ? " raoden asked , struggling to understand the question . " a man who can stand before the church - a man who must . "
[5/1000]	" where 's his room ? " " he 's standing at the front door , staring through the hole in the glass . " they got out , leaving the two of them alone in the living
[6/1000]	" good job <EOS> after that . i was having the best orgasm of my life . " he stepped back . " you 'll work more in the office then . i want to make sure it 's all
[7/1000]	" sorry . ca n't hear you . but i do n't hear you either . just you and me . " her eyes go wide . " who said that ? " " who do you think
[8/1000]	" what the hell do you want ? " " i want to know why you have n't knocked . " i shrugged . " <EOS> one day when i 'm taking care of this one night . "
[9/1000]	" of course i do n't ! what am i going to do ? " " do you want to take the job with the cia ? " " no ! of course not . my salary is
[10/1000]	" i 'm a little confused , but not for him ... " " do n't worry , " she said , laughing . " i have plenty of women in here , lots of room before bed .
[11/1000]	" what 's going on ? " he turned toward her and she saw the fury burning beneath his black eyes . " you do not remember the book ! " he shook his head . " no
[12/1000]	' so do i. ' when i left that day at lunchtime , he gave me the gist of what had happened . his eyes became troubled and he said quietly , ' i do n't know what to
[13/1000]	he is going to kill me . there 's a door opposite us and when i turn around , i see that the room to the right of me is occupied by a large black screen that does n't
[14/1000]	i almost did n't recognize the words coming out of her mouth . " i 'm not you - you know that , right ? " i blinked before i found out it was exactly the wrong thing to
[15/1000]	i nod , agreeing . " yeah . " i pause , then add , " at first i had no idea when i came back that things must have been different with my father . i mean , it
[16/1000]	" wait , he was in the house , " he said , " a few days before that girl , that jennifer , got killed in front of him . " " i thought he was working that
[17/1000]	" what ? " one of the women asked while the other one started counting on her fingers . the last one was obviously not particularly impressed by my manners . " what ? what is it that
[18/1000]	" well , what are you waiting for ? you need to get the hell out of here ! " i hissed , sending the last of my senses to take over . he jumped up and lunged for
[19/1000]	he paused as if to make sure that ben had not yet asked about him . " i was there a few years ago , " ben began . " for a few minutes i was the real ben
[20/1000]	" i like the look of you ... " i blushed . " no . you like it because you do n't have to . we 're both pretty stupid for running , but i think we 're both
[21/1000]	once he finally opened his eyes to see his wife standing up from the table , he realized that he was actually quite tired . he slowly got up off the sofa , wincing at the soreness in his neck
[22/1000]	" okay , then , " said mark . mark had been told that he was allowed to eat only vegetables , and that both he and the table were required a large room to do him what it
[23/1000]	" and the boy ? " she asked , staring at him hard . he glared up at her . " he came in earlier and saved me . " " he would really do that ? "
[24/1000]	she did realize his interest in her and wanted to protect his own interests . " i guess i should give you something , " she blurted , as if he 'd told her that they were lovers . "
[25/1000]	" no , it did n't . it 's a computer . it did n't come through . " i 'm sitting in the same chair , so when i heard the television click off i jumped instantly .
[26/1000]	' they ' , muttered the dwarf , ' need ' er to be cut up ' . he moved under some of the great pillars and watched the dwarves work on her . ' do you want that
[27/1000]	" i did n't mean to hurt your feelings . " the words came out of my mouth before i could stop them . it was true . i was hurt . i felt like a broken piece of myself
[28/1000]	my mouth dropped open . " no , i got it . i understand . i wo n't tell them . ever . " " that 's my girl , " he said , his tone one of surprise
[29/1000]	" we are all friends in many ways , " she said gently , lowering her lashes . " just you and i. it is true that i have had a difficult time getting what i want here , but
[30/1000]	" she is so beautiful , " she murmured . " i barely recognize her . " his grip tightened in her hair . as much as he knew she was n't as attracted to his mate as he
[31/1000]	" it was n't what i remembered . hell , it was more than anything i could have been thinking about ! something came over me and i felt something and everything started to click into place . he was
[32/1000]	or he would n't . or you could be lying . maybe while he was thinking those things , she 'd slipped off on her own . maybe it was easier that way . " i 've

[34/1000]	" yes ? " " we are not in the position to demand an apology if he were not our man . when will he be back ? " " as soon as he can . "
[35/1000]	" when did you realize you could do this ? " " when sam disappeared . " " you thought he was the one you 'd never see again ? " " i thought so . "
[36/1000]	" what ? " she was so surprised that she sputtered a laugh . " i do n't think i have ... " " you know , " he said . " you look totally comfortable in your suit

[38/1000]	i put in my earbuds and listened to the song , listening to it for hours as i worked on my thesis , until i could finally drift off to sleep . chapter 7 i woke to the
[39/1000]	" well , " i said . " what kind of equipment am i ? " " your driver 's license is actually not from this planet , " he said . " i think it 's because your

[41/1000]	" i do not want to . i do not want to make a big deal on this , " mr. parker said . his thin black eyebrows were creased the whole time as he stared at them . he
[42/1000]	" you look beautiful . " i leaned back and grinned up at him . " thank you . " i ran my finger along the line , to the center , and i gasped . his eyes followed
[43/1000]	" you 're still my husband , emma , " gabriel rumbled . " i 'll do what i can to take care of you , but not until i 've made sure you 're well . " "
[44/1000]	" do n't worry about it , " he said . " just a little test . " they were still at the cave door . jackson placed his hand on the door to let it open . it
[45/1000]	" i see . he 's a long shot . " ben 's lips pressed together . " not my way . " " your way is good . that 's why we 're here . he 's
[46/1000]	" no , i do n't think you 're still a complete lunatic . " " i 'm not ? " his blue eyes sparkled . " why , ma'am ? " " because <EOS> really mean men
[47/1000]	" you can do it , " he said with a frown , " like that . " i let out a small - maybe grudging - laugh . " or what ? " " you 're a
[48/1000]	" when did you and your brother marry ? " " a few days before my dad died . " i was pretty sure my lips were actually going to curl up in a half smile , but
[49/1000]	that was when he noticed the small patch of ground she was walking on . there seemed to be fresh dirt under her feet . his nostrils flared with desire . " come in my house . " "
[50/1000]	my eyes narrowed . at his actions , i guessed he had n't meant anything by it . i looked up at the woman he 'd shared with me . she was petite , blond and had the blu
[51/1000]	" my name 's not john . " the doctor looked at him for a moment , then said , " okay , john , i 'll do what i can , but you 'll have to open this
[52/1000]	i had not expected this . it was not happening . " do you know who these people are ? " " no , but i know who you are and i think they 're dangerous . "
[53/1000]	she pulled them off her face , taking her time to let them slide down from their pins and tuck them in the bottom of her dress . as she adjusted them on the back of her neck , she
[54/1000]	she smiled and nodded enthusiastically as she nodded again . " so , you want to go out on a date with me ? " she asked in a tone that made his heart beat harder in his chest
[55/1000]	" i saw a man and woman who look about our age . they were both wearing black . they were n't alone . a lady spoke of a doctor . " " what did they sound like ?
[56/1000]	" yeah , but ... " " but a gun did n't kill her , " john yelled out , feeling panic rise in his chest . " if it did it 's not because of the bullets .
[57/1000]	" what 's the catch , then ? " he asked . " it 's a lot of money to my accountant . " " why not just get it ? you 're rich and - "
[58/1000]	" no one gave me that description , " i answered , " but then , i have never been good at guessing . " " it was at the time , " he muttered . " then ,
[59/1000]	" do n't think that 's a good strategy , " i said , taking a small step forward , " just a little more of my own space . " you 'll hate it . " are you
[60/1000]	" maybe ? " " i want to pick out a room . " then he got up and started heading towards the kitchen . " maybe it would be better if i sat down down somewhere . "
[61/1000]	i pulled out my iphone from my pocket . that had n't been the phone i was looking for . it had been in my drawer . it was the one i 'd given aiden last year at
[62/1000]	" you wo n't , " she whispered . " i know it . i 've learned it from you . but he still loves you , so i wo n't stop him . and if what i see is
[63/1000]	before she could move back a fraction of an inch , someone knocked on the door and called her name . she felt herself start to slip before her legs tried to hold her . she felt her body being
[64/1000]	i 'm not proud of that part of my life . even the fact that it was a good thing , even though i needed to pay a visit to a hospital . the feeling of that one encounter with
[65/1000]	when i arrived back home , i opened the door and noticed my mother was indeed still in her dressing gown . she was sitting up in bed facing the window , but when i walked into the room she
[66/1000]	" here . " i held it up . " it 's perfect . thank you . " she walked over and hugged me , squeezing me tightly . " of course . i ca n't be angry with
[67/1000]	his voice low , he ordered , " you 're mine . " she knew it was the truth . but it also struck her as that of a warrior , in battle , he had absolute control of
[68/1000]	" fine , but no talking , " i tell the old man . " a couple seconds . " " anything else , mister ? " he asks in his surprisingly stern way - it 's hard not
[69/1000]	" i wish for you to come home . " i take a deep breath and realize i 'm thinking of tucker . " but you 're running from your mom . " " it 's not like
[70/1000]	" yeah , " connor answered . " tell them not to waste any more time . we mean them no harm , it 's just important that we act on their orders to save the people we want to
[71/1000]	" oh , god . it 's back . " she scrambled to her feet - she was as dizzy and nauseous as she was frightened . she took off running , her sandals slapping against the gravel . she
[72/1000]	i did not let anyone in . and i was n't in an enclosed space . what i shared with ren about my mom was totally my business , nothing to change . i started speaking as
[73/1000]	i put the key in the ignition . i do n't know why i called him this morning . i was going to tell him that there was something going on with me and my mother , but
[74/1000]	he was suddenly at his kitchen table , a bottle of whiskey in his hand and a bag of pretzels in his lap . the sight of his hands was calming . he ate and drank quickly , the taste
[75/1000]	" hey , a while back , " i say innocently . " i was supposed to , but it was n't working out so well with your mom . " bella 's face registers not quite betrayal ,
[76/1000]	it 's not easy to find the owner of the mansion you have taken over - she 'd never expected anything less of me , but i knew it was someone i trusted better than someone i hated until one
[77/1000]	" yes , that 's the one . " he hesitated for only a second . " i 'm not surprised . " " me neither . and maybe we wo n't ever see each other again .
[78/1000]	" yes , i saw that , " she retorted drily . another few moments passed , and she thought he was going to take those fingers and pull them out , but he did n't . " i had
[79/1000]	" what ? " jake asked as they walked back to her cabin . " i 'm going to be sick , " she muttered to herself as she made it to the bathroom , then tossed the empty
[80/1000]	the next morning they arrived before dawn and reported to lady l conn ach that she came in last night , to discuss lady maccon 's latest dispatch case . it was to be a new one , though one
[81/1000]	" it took her a minute to stop screaming when i brought a crowbar in here and busted the lock off . " i look around the room , " i found a bunch of clothes too . i think
[82/1000]	at first he felt nothing . he was only aware of the touch of his hands gently caressing his knees , his head rested against his knees , his body in shock . ' why ? why did you
[83/1000]	and here came the rest of the " team " , armed to the teeth . the moment of reckoning came as i came upon the man i suspected was my father . he stood at least six foot
[84/1000]	" yeah . i already know if you 're coming . " she said putting a finger to her mouth , just above where her mouth hid before she took a hesitant step onto the patio and peeked through the
[85/1000]	" i 'm telling the truth . " " tell me , danny ! " " why should i ? i got a lot of jobs or shit from my dad too . i love my money and
[86/1000]	" oh , man , look , there 's so much more to you than you think . " my smile is lopsided . i do n't have the heart to tell her that i 'm much more than
[87/1000]	she nodded , but what she really wanted to do was to pull him into the shelter of her bed . he was so thick and solid . " does it hurt when i 'm with you ? " she
[88/1000]	her lips moved and i remembered having the strangest premonition about his presence in my life . " no . just the other night , when i woke up in my bed again . you 're in there , as
[89/1000]	" do n't worry , " he said . " you 're going to get a lot of action . tonight i 'm teaching you some self - control . you do n't want to be fighting with your brother
[90/1000]	but maybe the future of our nation depended on it . not the past . the future was about keeping our children 's secrets and protecting the legacy that had been left in the hands of the powerful .
[91/1000]	slowly , almost as if it was painful for him not to move , he lifted his arms wide and then closed his eyes . his breath stopped . she thought she heard him say , not my name
[92/1000]	ian : see you later . i run past the group and go out the back door . ian : i have one more part of the wedding party to put up with . me : got
[93/1000]	" what kind of food costs , " i asked . " oh , a lot of money . the store is owned by a woman . some of our regulars call her the store manager - or maybe
[94/1000]	and though all i heard was the sound of my own breathing , i could n't look away from her . " you ... do ? " " you did n't tell me how you found out , "
[95/1000]	i guess in the early stages of the season , you do n't need much imagination to get what you want . " i glanced at my watch and looked down at my cell phone , then back at
[96/1000]	" i do n't regret my choices , " she said honestly , " but they 're just what you should have wanted . i was disappointed in you people , i was angry - " " at what
[97/1000]	after reading their letters they had decided that she was the better man , he was the good man , but neither wanted to ruin what they had . although they had never been intimate before , the thought of
[98/1000]	" your face ... " he did n't follow those words . he put his elbows on the railing and stared down at me . " the thing is , " he said quietly , " we do
[99/1000]	i gave a slight smile to her . " sure , i will . " she nodded and then hopped into the front seat of her car . as i leaned back and let out a sigh of relief
[100/1000]	there was a quiet period and , without a word , i pushed the car back into gear . the speed limit indicator was still high . my hand was getting tired , but it was slow . i kept
[101/1000]	her eyebrows , like feathers , lifted . " i 'd say , though , that has earned the right to kick down doors himself . " his smile was a slow , lazy glide , settling in the
[102/1000]	" we need to find him , " he insisted . " you ca n't just leave . you have to talk to him or at least talk to your mother . this ca n't be done . not without
[103/1000]	" are you sure it would n't be better if i come here some other time ? this is a very important matter , " she said , a bit too convincingly . " i 'll cancel . i
[104/1000]	* * * it was around eight in the morning in the city of me gid . after nearly five hours traveling on an endless route the streets became quiet and abandoned . the streets began to thin ,
[105/1000]	" how much do you care ? " she asked , ignoring the question . " i do n't care about your money , eva , but i love my family more . " he did n't look happy
[106/1000]	" do n't tell another soul that i do n't have any secrets . tell them that just because i 'm not a priest does n't mean i 'm a good wife . god knows i 'm no christian -
[107/1000]	" and to answer your question , it is a really complicated set of rules you 've got on the table , so it 's easy to see why we want you for the right reasons . " a
[108/1000]	" i was in a foul mood and decided to stay for lunch , " he says tightly . " you 're not going to believe any of this . " i pause , turning to face him .
[109/1000]	and with that , ian turned and left , leaving her to her final task . chapter 10 sophie 's mother sat on the sofa , trying to concentrate on food and drinking with her mother . no
[110/1000]	" you may do as you please , " he said . he turned his head back around . i felt a rush of shame to realize that i was so lost in him that i had actually forgotten what
[111/1000]	" really ? " jason 's surprise showed , and he backed away for a few steps , his eyes widening . " then you ca n't be serious ? " " dead serious . " " really
[112/1000]	" i see . " " let me move the boat so that some of the men can remove it . " alex thought about it for a moment before she nodded and grabbed it . then she
[113/1000]	" i do n't understand about this other guy , " jane said , giving danny a worried look . " why 's he so weird ? " " i do n't know , exactly . " danny looked
[114/1000]	she looked over at me and gave me a small , sympathetic smile . " i hope you have a safe trip back to houston . " she pulled around to the side and parked beneath a light -
[115/1000]	he was right . after a short while , when all the lights went out , she said , " i 'll sleep under the stars . " once you realize you have something real and valuable , no
[116/1000]	" the people in the building ? they were locked up ? " i remembered the bodies . i nodded . " yeah about that ... you have to get all the victims out right away . that 's
[117/1000]	" be sure to put yourself into the same category as the rest of us , " said the queen . " there is an ad age : ' one who hates the enemy of god is one who desp
[118/1000]	" i see . i will get to them first . " but he was fading inside his own head . where will they go now ? and what will happen to me ? when he began to move
[119/1000]	" yes . " a half smile pulled at his lush mouth , which was set in a cruel , sensual line . " i understand where you 're coming from , of course . " " then why
[120/1000]	" i was ... i do n't know what went on between us , but i should n't have walked into a trap like that . the only explanation is that i was n't looking . " i looked over
[121/1000]	" are you saying you 're not serious ? " i asked . " what does it matter ? " david laughed softly . " have patience , kasey . you will know when the time is right .
[122/1000]	' you know , first in every event , he goes wrong . ' suddenly , if only you had not interfered , she thought . but you are here , so let it go . when are you
[123/1000]	i opened my mouth to say something to him but he was gone . no words . more than i expected as i watched him walk away from me , taking the stage in his tailored tux . a tuxedo
[124/1000]	" where are the other two ? " " not sure . and what 's going on is the kind of thing an adult would know . i really do n't know ! " " where are most
[125/1000]	" i am . " there was more than a little belliger ence in him . we both looked over to take a look at the open space . the car was still there . " i 'll lead
[126/1000]	i watched , eyes wide , as the door started to open . a tall skinny black man in sunglasses followed , followed by dozens of others , each carrying a staff . they were all laughing , my
[127/1000]	he started shaking his head like someone wanted him to do something else . " a lot of people think it 's a silly thing to do . their whole life is n't about taking care of your mother or
[128/1000]	i wanted to argue but he 'd seen - felt and tasted to the depths of his soul . i did n't owe him any explanations . i had tried to protect him , but i could n't . nothing
[129/1000]	he did n't want to look any closer at the face . we stood outside . " yeah . how you feeling ? " " better . are you okay ? " i nodded . " i 'm
[130/1000]	she grabbed my hip and pulled me through the house to the doorway on the right . if jake was waiting outside there he would wait for me . i stopped in my tracks . " did you actually
[131/1000]	" no , " he said , in a quiet voice . " the same one . " his lips found mine and i felt his arms tighten around me , giving me an involuntary shiver . it took
[132/1000]	and i understood . i also knew her mother was a very old woman , in her seventies maybe , and it made me happy that my very old mother even seemed to still be alive . finally
[133/1000]	in the early afternoon the sun dipped downward , casting the sky into deep purple shadow . the sky was far from full ... this time of year the shadows were lengthening , and the sky was an almost deep
[134/1000]	that 's what i 'm worried about . " i ca n't get the name and the number of the call they were expecting , " i inform the clerk . if they 're called ahead of time ,
[135/1000]	" we 'll talk about it , " i assured him , sitting back on my heels . " and i 'll be careful in getting my purse back . " the moment ian took off , i scrambled
[136/1000]	" all right , we 're going in the main saloon . " the boy looked at susan in surprise , " you can tell the barkeep not to fight . " the girl nodded and pointed to the
[137/1000]	" because . " because ... ? " " i like you , and i 've wanted your brother since he killed my grandfather . " a tear had fallen from her eye . " because i love
[138/1000]	not knowing what else to say , i say just what i need to tell her . " are you okay ? " " yeah . " her eyes shift down to her hands and she opens her voice
[139/1000]	to the north , the night sky loomed above the tall trees , his twin siblings visible through them . they were all dressed in black , despite the sun , and though he told himself they were all of
[140/1000]	he could see , through the haze , that she would be up in the rafters , working . he could hear her breathing . she had no chance of moving much beyond the room and he 'd already told
[141/1000]	" she thinks i 'm gon na ' have a baby . " a low - pitched laugh escaped through his dry lips . he held his hand up between them and stepped back . " i should give you
[142/1000]	" okay . i agree . i really am sorry . " " what 's the matter ? " " i just want things back to normal . that 's all . i do n't exactly want the
[143/1000]	" what , the car ? " " no . " she laughed , but the sound was oddly flat , and that caused her throat to swell shut . she forced a smile to her lips , but
[144/1000]	" no , it does n't , " said neville . " we have to wait a few minutes and see if we can find anything out of the ordinary . i want us to be able to see and
[145/1000]	" we can always do a re match tomorrow night . " when he pressed her against the glass panel of his rental , she pushed against his chest , not moving an inch from this man who could
[146/1000]	a light - headed wonder , she got to her knees in front of her father 's desk . pulling back his chair , she sat down and grabbed one of his hands , squeezing it tightly . "
[147/1000]	she blinked . she 'd always had been good at controlling him , but this ... this was different . it was n't going to be easy . it was going to be very bad . cole took a
[148/1000]	well , actually , she only had one stipul ation , but the second was something in the contract . one stipul ation would allow her to go to one of the men without the risk of losing her job
[149/1000]	in place of the one - way mirror , she 'd been wearing a pink - and - blue sequined top . her breasts were round and round and strong , her nipples hard , her hips tiny . damn
[150/1000]	" i think he was going to say that . i do n't think i like it , " i replied . it had been too long since i 'd spent time with a kid , and if

[160/1000]	a sense of doom swept over her . a sudden realization hit her . it was her fault . would she die if she stayed ? once again , " the damned bitch thought to offer your hand
[161/1000]	" no , she 's the one who did it . " as the two men faced one another , he could n't help but notice that , regardless of what else was on the table , neither of
[162/1000]	i had another thought . this one had me on edge and wanting something , something really real , but i did n't know what i was looking for and the most terrifying feeling was that i did n't know
[163/1000]	" so that 's where the tears come from . you 're as brave as you are magnificent . " " thank you , " she said with a wry smirk . " do you mind ? "
[164/1000]	" i think it 's what my father would probably call in a hostile takeover , " i tell her . " what else can it be ? " she asks , her face a little dark . she
[165/1000]	he went right for it . " i 'm not your servant , jane . you 're my sister . nothing less . " " then why can you look after me ? " anger seethed out of
[166/1000]	" we ca n't just stand around here , " he said , putting his hands in his pockets despite the heat of the day . " we have to go . " without glancing back , we sprinted
[167/1000]	without thinking much about it , i move back into the living room . a lot closer than i had originally thought . with almost as much as i feel about him , he 's already made it clear we

[171/1000]	where was this little piece of shit ? they passed her slowly . they did n't stop . they did n't look at her , they just stared . she was no special . she was a worthless
[172/1000]	" this is not a pretty picture . look at the dead bodies : a young boy and woman lying in front of the camera , blood covering their body , lifeless . their throats ripped out . when the
[173/1000]	he took another leap . they fell free and fell before the river . for a moment we all froze , then turned to the man . there was a hint of panic to his face that i

[175/1000]	" i 'll deal with the driver and the cops . " the next several minutes were spent in silence . the detective 's hand was a steady steady pressure against claire 's shoulder and the radio behind her
[176/1000]	but then , suddenly , the line went dead . " um ... john ? " " hey . " he smiled at me . " hi there , liz . think you could look at my notes
[177/1000]	" my father and uncle . " his first reaction was to cry out as joy echoed through him , but then his joy and anger faded and he understood her intent . in the old days , the

[180/1000]	" no . " one of them ran his fingers through his fine hair . " that 's not what i meant at all . " " then what was it ? " john asked , stepping back and
[181/1000]	she could hear him thinking , ' i 'm sorry , son , but this information 's on my desk . ' his desk . why ? as expected , it was a room in the back wall of this
[182/1000]	" sure . i guess we could go out and do something . i need to get my hair done though . " " i can take care of that for you . " " no , i
[183/1000]	" what are you up to , sugar ? " he asked when she paused . " it could mean nothing . " she laughed . " why would n't it ? i just wanted to say goodnight .

[185/1000]	he was already in motion , heading for the stairs . " but i do n't want to be rude . " she could feel charlie watching but she ignored him , her heels clicking on the stone floor .
[186/1000]	" do you want to go ? " he asked . " let 's go , " cassie said . and with that , they made their way out of the hospital with the same purpose as before
[187/1000]	the last word seemed to echo around the cavern . then its reverber ation eased into a normal sound , enough to fill him with relief . with one last look from the giant black eye gazing from beneath the

[189/1000]	" like you 've got anything else to say . " " oh , i do have something to say . " he walked around our table and caught up with us as we strolled through the mall aisle

[191/1000]	some of the workers at the factory , having finished their lunch , waved at me and i went inside . it was small and musty , but i found a bench that was like many others . i sat
[192/1000]	even so , with that touch , it startled her , if not at all , and she suddenly found herself staring down into his clear blue eyes , just inches away from her own . was she dreaming ?
[193/1000]	i did n't care . " ca n't say , " i muttered . " i have n't told him yet . " " well . he seems to know , " she said , biting her lip .
[194/1000]	" did you see how they treated her down below ? " she asked , her voice carrying across the courtyard to the servant 's entrance . she stood at the base of the steps with her hands in her
[195/1000]	it was her mother who interrupted her , and when she heard her say , " there you are , my dear , i was beginning to worry about you . i have been worried for days . "
[196/1000]	" when or where it should be . " " it should be ready in here at four o'clock ? " " two hours from now . " " good luck , nick . " he
[197/1000]	' that 's a good question , ' i said . ' are you going to stand there looking all indignant for an hour ? ' ' no . ' ' no ? that 's too bad .
[198/1000]	the woman shot her a look but did n't say anything . the man took out his phone and made some calls . it did n't take long for a short while before detective burns was on the line .
[199/1000]	" no , but there is something i think you should know . i do n't know how to explain it to ye . " jamie gave him an odd look . " you should understand . "
[200/1000]	she frowned . " the phone calls - " her fingers stroked over his skin , easing the rough scar tissue . his breath hissed out , even as she soothed it with gentle petting . his fingers tangled
[201/1000]	not that i was going to say that myself . i sat up straight , grabbing more water from the jug and taking a big swig , swishing it around in my mouth . that did the trick .
[202/1000]	" yes , mr. van wright , " she said . " she 's very dedicated , i 'm sure you 'll be able to work it out . " sean began to nod . " i want to
[203/1000]	" no , " the stranger said firmly . " i 'll get my sword . you stop him , then . i wo n't stand here next to those two dead . i have some serious respect for you
[204/1000]	the young woman had a nice look about her . slim but shapely in fit but bulky boots , short skirt , and short sleeved but clingy sweater . on her feet she wore dark brown leather boots with clear
[205/1000]	what is wrong with her ? why does she act so strange over the phone when we 're supposed to be doing the best we can ? but she just has this ... this crazy look on her face
[206/1000]	she chuckled and opened her mouth over her words to tell him about all the places they got to see . what they had done , what they missed , the history they shared , the experiences they shared ,
[207/1000]	his eyes flickered to mine , one eyebrow arched . " you 're telling me you 're being set up ? " " no , i 'm just saying that if you call and tell me that you need
[208/1000]	" you 're about to get a concussion , you know that , " i warn him . " i 'm fine , " he retorts . " look , this is different . it 's my job to

[210/1000]	not that he bothered asking . he already knew . he 'd had almost no sleep the last couple of days , and despite all his efforts , all he could think about was her . she was
[211/1000]	" it could last a few days , but ... " he made a grimace . " i need to be present for the final showdown against the vamp queen , so ... " " shit , " i
[212/1000]	who was in charge , though ? she thought . she would n't push . she had n't been expecting a proposal of marriage ; she had been thinking of a way to see the marriage through to the end
[213/1000]	you ca n't , " he said , " you ca n't . " " i wo n't , " she said from between gritted teeth . " your secret 's safe with me . " he offered
[214/1000]	" you always have , " i say to myself . " so why not ? " " uh , because , " i say , smiling a little at my own cleverness . " it 's too late
[215/1000]	" of course i will . what is our plan ? " " listen , it 's going to get rough . he 's going to be in the water , in which case we 'll have to do
[216/1000]	i was about to ask peter if he 'd heard about it when he pointed his pistol at me . " i have an idea , " peter said . i glared up at him . "
[217/1000]	" hey ! " she screams at me , but then i see that it is n't her voice anymore . she 's screaming at someone off to my left ; i do n't even recognize the name . if
[218/1000]	but really ... nothing was her fault . except they could n't accept the fact that on this trip she 'd been completely absent from her friends , not to mention every single thing she 'd been doing
[219/1000]	" well , she might n't stay in the picture then . " " she 's your daughter . " " i 'll let your husband know i thought about it . " once again i was
[220/1000]	" no comment . " she said simply , but her tone and the implication in her words confirmed that she was not at all impressed by his lack of commentary . " what is it you think of
[221/1000]	" you mean that ? " " of course . " she leaned in and kissed him a final time , long and deep . " that 's right . just do n't let a man 's bed ever
[222/1000]	" not really . maybe the only thing that 's done is to leave it to your imagination . " he stared at me . " i just like to work . even though you make me miserable .
[223/1000]	" the thought came to me . you give me pleasure , and i treat you well , and to my lord 's relief you feel more like me . " " i feel the same , for i
[224/1000]	" no , please , i need you to tell me what you had for dinner tonight . " " oh , it was just something we had . it was chicken - fried steak . " i
[225/1000]	" it seems that i did exactly what mom would have done , done the same to my own people . " " she would have killed you , son . have you found any evidence yet ? "
[226/1000]	" maybe , " she said . " you 're not going to get a lot of blood done with this . " " what do you mean , i 'm not going to get blood ? "
[227/1000]	" we 're going with the high - speed , high - endurance , high - endurance , high - endurance motor vehicle . we must drive an equal mile and then loop us back around to be able to

[230/1000]	jack had called me last night back , at five am . we asked if he was okay , and he 'd told us he had been a little freaked out . it was the equivalent of talking to her
[231/1000]	<EOS> on the deck , a small figure appeared beside her as jennifer fell into a light sleep , aware only of one small person at all . she could not quite make out her companion 's features , but
[232/1000]	" i love you . " ~ ~ ~ " hey , guys , " ari said , sticking her head in the door . i wondered how she 'd gotten through the day without all her girls
[233/1000]	" just do n't say hello . " it took her a moment to realize he was asking her permission , but her hand flashed out and connected with caleb 's before he caught the doorknob in his fingers
[234/1000]	he was staring at her . " i told you i 'd take you to bed if you 'd just promise to come to me home . " she 'd known him her whole life , just like that
[235/1000]	she looked down at her arms . they were pink and she had put several freckles on them . why in the world had she done that ? she could hear her dad calling her out of the bedroom
[236/1000]	" nothing . " he 'd just been too busy trying to explain the finer points of bdsm to watch if a woman came on the scene . " have you been up there ? " lily shook her
[237/1000]	i guess it is ! she leaned back and lowered her gaze . our lips rested slightly apart , and i noticed that she was breathing faster , too . my whole body felt feverish in the moments
[238/1000]	" you 're a little different than your buddies out there . " the first part was true ; he was . she might have felt a bit of empathy whenever she 'd seen him at parties and clubs
[239/1000]	" maybe , " i said , shrugging . " or maybe you 're just a bitch . " she raised an eyebrow . " you two are n't that different . " " i probably am ,
[240/1000]	" you 're all out of luck - because i do n't have a date . " she tried to put on a smile , but the fear was still there , along with a pain in her chest .
[241/1000]	" i am , on your side . " " i guess that made you mad . " " no , " i said softly . " because i know your value , too . " my
[242/1000]	" she is , " he said . " but not enough . " he held out his hand and reached for me and pulled me to him . " in fact , " he added , " i would
[243/1000]	' right . ' she looked at the sky . ' so now what are we supposed to do ? ' ' just lie still until dawn , ' said peaches . ' a few hours wo n't hurt
[244/1000]	' no ! ' i screamed , taking the knife from him with desperate strength . ' i 'm not going to run away . i never go away ! i need to find the truth ! ' my hands
[245/1000]	" nothing . i was fine earlier . " he was looking down at his hands . " i 'm still a little shaky . it 's just being reminded of everything . " she reached out and gently
[246/1000]	" we 've already established there 's nothing to suggest that the three of us are working for the same entity , " said trevize in an attempt to save face . pelorat said , " is that so
[247/1000]	it 's nearly midnight , and i 'm exhausted . i want to be back in bed with my boys , but i could n't talk myself out of going to bed . that would only make things worse .
[248/1000]	" so , he 's off to a meeting with some politicians , " says amy , " and i 'm sittin ' here here with mr. mcbride , what 's all this going to be , his big ,
[249/1000]	" at the moment , some things require something different . " i sighed . he did seem different . " the doctor is going to get me to the hospital . and i need some rest .
[250/1000]	" yeah , " connor answered . " we 'd like to hear about that one . " the old man sighed and pulled at the lapel of his wool overcoat , the man with the handle bar moustache
[251/1000]	" why did he attack you ? " he asked , and she could tell why he did n't want to answer until she agreed to the question . but how could she tell him the truth when he had
[252/1000]	and then she gave it just a little bit more , until he was gasping for air . she brought the sheet up to his hips , and pushed inside , deeper . he started to lift up

[257/1000]	" no , i 'm having a very bad dream , " she answered , feeling the fear that she was actually about to share her dreams with her father . like maybe he was actually aware of them ,
[258/1000]	" not good ? " i tease . " good , " he breathes , putting a hand on each of my shoulders and turning me to face the wall again . " i want to show you what
[259/1000]	i kept my eyes closed for a second and listened to the quiet of the kitchen . " you got a way back to them ? " he asked . " no . " " not ?
[260/1000]	" it 's just that ... it 's just like everything to her . you do n't do people . " " well , it 's not all that different from being that she had to work with and
[261/1000]	" you 're really a prince - and not of the kingdom , either ? " " not all royals have a unique coloring or facial structure . my mother is the heir , so i am the second
[262/1000]	her answer was a little louder than she 'd expected . she figured she 'd have to hope for the best . " the girls are in a group down there . " he jerked his head in the
[263/1000]	" i do n't think i 'll miss out on this . " " of course not . " the corner of her mouth rose . she was so serious . " now you must leave at once or
[264/1000]	" how many of these bastards will kill you ? " he countered . ar mont continued to stand . " all of them ! " " do you want the hell off the island , or the
[265/1000]	" sure do , and i 'm off to tell you why . " " really ? you 're going to talk about the way you 're feeling ? " " yup . " he 'd made
[266/1000]	" uh ... yes . " " what is that supposed to mean ? " " why i 've turned now . " he looks more furious now than normal . " you ... are ... insane
[267/1000]	" oh , please , i 'm so not ! " she had to remind him . " of course i will . that 's not what this whole summer is about , nick . you 're going to make
[268/1000]	" do n't think we have to talk to them , " he mumbled as he opened the door . she threw her drink down in the trash can and began walking out . " why are you even
[269/1000]	" it 's not my fault ; i just got some answers . " the line died , leaving him sitting at the desk , frowning and staring at nothing . " james , " she said ,
[270/1000]	" i 'm sorry i did n't call you sooner . i was afraid something might have happened to you . " " nothing happened . " her eyes are glassy with tears , which gives me hope .

[272/1000]	i looked at his back , his ass , his skin , his hair . god . i loved his hair . it made me forget what i was doing and my eyes fluttered closed . it felt

[275/1000]	" yes . " she nodded , and kept searching . " i saw my father , but i had no idea about the others . father said they were all to be killed . i do n't know how
[276/1000]	" and the next time you tell someone about the fire , you expect a response . no one with a gun will believe you . " you ca n't fight a war that much harder than the one

[283/1000]	" i said this is for the police ? " there was even a hint of respect for the family , if a touch over exaggerated , in the man 's whisper , as though he expected it .
[284/1000]	" you ca n't mean that . you know i have an account here at the hotel . " " i told you how i feel about nothing less than a loan . but i 'm thinking you 're

[298/1000]	he closed his eyes and took a deep breath . just a few minutes more . he felt the press of the hot stone and the vibration of the stones beneath his skin . the others stood , silent ,
[299/1000]	" you mean the baby , " olivia said , wincing at her joke . " no , olivia , " robin said , frowning , " the baby . will you remember that , wo n't you ?
[300/1000]	" maybe i 'll take you fishing someday . unless , you do n't want to learn not to ride . " he laughed . " think about it . we could put you in a cage ,

[302/1000]	" you wanted to be , did n't you ? " " i 've often envied the kids our age . what would a daughter want to do if she was young ? " " maybe you 're
[303/1000]	" i told you i am . then it is your turn , " i say . " oh , yes ! " i hear his voice in my head . i 've caught his scent in my lungs
[304/1000]	" you sure about that ? that still sounds a little old , considering the age of all of us " . " how old is it ? " his face twisted . " the question is . "
[305/1000]	' ah . ' the wizard turned round expectantly . the wizard raised several fingers . ' which of these ? ' the wizard gave him a significant look . ' ah . i do n't quite
[306/1000]	i smiled . " thanks , " i lied . he looked at me with his soft brown eyes . " so , i guess i should get back to work then , huh ? " " yes
[307/1000]	" wow , " i finally say while i search for my cup of tea . " it 's been a while . " " yeah . " she stares off into space without saying a word .
[308/1000]	she nods her head at the door , her face pale . i step up to her and give her a hard hug . " it 's going to be okay , baby . i 'm right here ,
[309/1000]	" ah , " he said , and he lifted my gaze to meet his . " what ? " " there are n't any books . we are n't using them . " i shrugged .
[310/1000]	the other car pulled into the circular drive - one that had a red car like her own . the girl behind the wheel nodded and called back to her . " i 'll be there in a little
[311/1000]	' yes . ' ' you are an expert , ' the bfg said doubtfully . ' i am very good at being a very good girl , ' sophie said , having finished her long chat with
[312/1000]	she smiled , reaching past his shoulder to push the buttons of the door , giving the order to open . no sooner had she grasped the handle then the door swung open , revealing the black sky beyond with
[313/1000]	" you said your name was ... " i wanted to speak to her , but it was all a blur in my mind . i looked at my hand . i did n't know him , but i
[314/1000]	something about the way they were held up was alarming to me . they were like baby kittens - delicate and fragile and fragile . but these babies - they were not fragile . their bones seemed to be bent
[315/1000]	" that 's really sweet of you , but i do n't think you have any interest in this , " said the young woman at my side . her words sounded nervous . " oh , i think
[316/1000]	i thought of the look on my face that first night we met . a look almost like regret . a look i 've never seen from jett . he must have been terrified to get close to me at
[317/1000]	the boys were having a real hard time in accepting it as true . of course , they did n't know that the real reason they were living together was to avoid the stress of living together . it was
[318/1000]	she would not , could not . " the queen 's sister was right . i was stupid . i deserve that . " " oh , that 's just wonderful . " his hand moved to her cheek
[319/1000]	maybe she was right . maybe it was still true . but what did that mean ? where was she supposed to drive to the next two days ? where would she go ? what would she do ? could
[320/1000]	it was me that should be crying and i could n't take it anymore . i just needed him to say it . he needed to hear me say it in words so that i would n't feel like i
[321/1000]	" so were you at that party , too ? " she said , her voice filled with curiosity . " at the party at the club back at your place ? " so she always knew my whereabouts
[322/1000]	" it 's okay baby . i know it 's late . " i was already shaking my head . i was so tired and the tears came out fast . i took a moment to catch my
[323/1000]	my face felt warm and i glared . " i 've been around you all summer , you know . " this was true . i 'd moved in and moved in six months before . " you
[324/1000]	" well , you 've been so kind showing up here . i guess , yes , i suppose you should be grateful not to have been on duty all day and <EOS> the rest of your days . "
[325/1000]	" sure . i was thinking of an early picnic . " she turned to sam for confirmation . " do you want to come , too ? " " yeah , " he said . " i 'd
[326/1000]	the rest of dinner consisted of a lot of food . " i do n't know about what people say about us , but i 've had better . " she said , breaking the silence . "
[327/1000]	" i thought he had an appointment with my lawyer . " i had n't thought that point out . like i said , he 's probably my lawyer or something . " yeah , but he really should
[328/1000]	" now do n't you start saying that , " james warns . " it 's not the first time you 've threatened my dad . " " of course it 's not , but it 's the first
[329/1000]	" not true . " " the man in " - i was hesitant to use his real name - " he 's good . real good , " i promised as she slid up my body and kissed
[330/1000]	" i 'm not really sure i want him <EOS> at least not to tell . " the look on his face , even though he stopped breathing was strange for some strange reason . he had asked about
[331/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said . he looked embarrassed , and he looked pretty disgusted with myself . " i was a dumbass . but i 'm tired of lying to myself . i 'm sick of
[332/1000]	what ? " why - ? " he trailed off , and the shock of it seemed to stun her . " and why in the hell would you do that ? all those poor people dying , one by
[333/1000]	" no , mom , you 're not . you do n't get it . just do what you need to do . if any of us survive , we 'll find a way to fix it . "
[334/1000]	the voice in her head has been getting louder since they 'd entered and it 's more determined now than ever . you are a whore ! she stares hard across the room at me , shaking inside
[335/1000]	" i see , " dr. pazzo said , " and your testimony is based on our findings ? " " we have not uncovered his secrets . we have only found traces of his dna . we know
[336/1000]	" a couple of the guys are helping us with the computers and stuff , " said jay . " it 's all still pretty cool . " " how exactly do you know all this stuff ? "
[337/1000]	" if it did , it would definitely be in their minds ! " " did she have a boyfriend ? " i ask . i 'm not sure i want to hear the answer , but there i
[338/1000]	" she put the other car . " " she did ? she had to wash it , did n't she ? " " it 's a brand new old car , from some company with big tires
[339/1000]	" i heard his brothers got married all in the middle of the night , " john states , breaking the silence . taking a deep breath for courage , i answer him . " it sounds like a
[340/1000]	in exchange i just shrug . " what do you know about getting paid in money and then not spending it ? " he asks . " nothing really . i 've spent thousands of dollars on clothes
[341/1000]	" i have to . " he sighed . " but you know me too well . " i felt my heart swell as jack hugged me , his head leaning against mine . " i love you
[342/1000]	i turned around so i could see the sun shining through the ceiling . since the sun was probably already up , i pushed the door open and walked in . the room - we were inside - was so
[343/1000]	" you know , there 's been this one guy who 's been in my life that i 'm not sure about , " said jane . " i do n't know much about him , but i know it
[344/1000]	" have you thought about what i said ? " he asked . he took his left hand from where it was resting on the door sill . " i do n't want you to break any of my dreams
[345/1000]	i nodded , looking forward to the rest of my day . if only i could make it through the day without him , even a few minutes before i started seeing him . we should n't be apart for
[346/1000]	that 's actually what she 'd said . too bad , because she 'd made it clear she thought those were the last words and that she could n't help him . of course , one of the reasons she
[347/1000]	" i 'm sure , " he said . which was also something she would n't have thought a man like him could talk to her about . it was n't simply that he was sexy , that he
[348/1000]	" who are you and what do you want ? " he asked . she was silent for a moment . " i have a request , " she said , trying to think of a way at it
[349/1000]	" what is this place ? " " some place you wo n't be able to leave anything . " " let me grab your jacket . " " what ? " " all of it
[350/1000]	the driver got out of the car , and before john could react , the boy opened the hatch and climbed up the wall of the van , holding the handle . john took a long gulp of the cool
[351/1000]	only when she saw the man coming for her did she feel a rush of power - the kind you get when you see magic , one you 've never known before . she tried to turn away , but
[352/1000]	he stepped back toward the tent and i rushed after him . he was shaking his head . ' that 's crazy . ' still , i pressed my lips together . it was n't the same as
[353/1000]	with a flick of her heel , she dragged me to a stop beside her , and i looked up to see a group of rowdy - looking boys standing at my back . laughing in delight , the group
[354/1000]	" hello ? " i answer , and i can hear someone shuffling around in the background . more than just a soft , muffled voice . but then someone says , " mom , it 's me , caleb
[355/1000]	she sighed . " i hate being a princess , you know . so what should i do ? tell her she 'll have to live with herself . live it for the rest of her life .... "
[356/1000]	the two men looked at each other in silence , the only sound the faint hiss of their breath as their lungs struggled to fill what they were both breathing . nick held up a hand before he could speak
[357/1000]	he nodded . " and she 's out of town . " grace was quiet for a moment . then she took a deep breath again . " are you okay ? " " no . "
[358/1000]	alex left her alone to gather her belongings as she made her way back to class . several days later they were able to get a late lunch between classes and returned to the empty classroom to grab some food
[359/1000]	" he 's going to be okay . i just did n't want to worry you either . he 's trying . " she nodded and tried not to worry that now that she had her brother , that
[360/1000]	" i 'm pretty sure . " i said sitting down at the table . " let me see . " " here , " i handed him the list of items i was willing to give him
[361/1000]	i leaned up and kissed his lips . " thank you for helping me , " i whispered , kissing him again . " i thought i was getting a little carried away that night , " he said
[362/1000]	" well , you do n't have anyone to invite . you have the whole thing planned out , it happened , the whole thing and the reason you called it a date . anyway , i can see it
[363/1000]	" let them know i understand . " i could n't help but meet <EOS> - ( again as if he really did everything he was in the forest that i used to use . i had never been a
[364/1000]	he had to get to her . he could not let anything happen to her . he 'd had his chance all along , he was going to take it , now he just had to hang on .
[365/1000]	" this is not a problem , " he answered , his voice harsh with fear and pain . the second body remained where he had left it , but it was black . she was in one
[366/1000]	he 's an old enemy of mine . i have a good feeling that he 'll end up with his balls knocked up . " " he 'll be with me even if i 'm not . "
[367/1000]	slowly , he closed the gap and placed the butt of his gun against her adam 's apple before saying , " you were n't there . " " damn it , ethan , it was over five years
[368/1000]	" i wanted to see you all three times i was married to karen , " he says . " we were good together . " " so were the rest of us . " " no .
[369/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , baby . is it <EOS> " - as she placed her head on my chest again and my finger at her neck , breathing into her hair - " your grandmother ? "
[370/1000]	" i would like to have a chance to think after your visit , " isabella replied , hoping to ease the tense atmosphere . " that 's why i came here . " " i see , "
[371/1000]	" you have no idea , " she mumbled , as she stared out at the water . " i know . have you ever experienced freedom ? " he asked . " no . " "
[372/1000]	" no , " he said . " it was always me . he told me your father was a detective . he knew about you . he told me i would n't be able to go home with you
[373/1000]	" i 've never really liked him , " kendra added , " <EOS> you look so grim you could use a brick around your mouth . when he said you promised to love him forever so he could grow
[374/1000]	" my father said how the town did it the first time . " " you think he 's right ? " " well , when i leave here , in two weeks or so i 'm calling
[375/1000]	" she 's already here , " he replied . he watched as their eyes met and a desire lit the depths of her eyes . he felt a sudden rush of warmth at the knowledge he probably was
[376/1000]	i hear the clatter of feet on the stairs , then the creaking of the door , announcing damien 's arrival . he gives me a cursory shake as he stands on his tiptoes and hugs me . " i
[377/1000]	not good . " i think i would like it if you would move in with me ... for a few days . " she slowly raised her head and looked into his eyes . " i ... have
[378/1000]	i hear one of the kids call out : " hey , i 'm talking to the boss , we 're leaving ! " i follow the rest of the team from the hangar , towards the driveway .
[379/1000]	" what kind of people ? " " she does n't say . but the women she 's with have them all . " he paused . " but when she has a boyfriend or lover , someone or
[380/1000]	" do n't be stupid ! you 've been doing nothing but sleeping all day ! you 're going out there in the middle of the night to do some boring stuff if you want , so i suggest you
[381/1000]	" the fact that you think that i have any say in your whereabouts is a good way to prove that i have any say in us . " he takes a sip of the cool water from a bottle
[382/1000]	chapter 13 ' are you ready to do this , little brother ? ' patroclus called out as the final hours of the night unfurled . atreus jumped from his bed . ' yeah , ' he called
[383/1000]	" i 've got it . " he took it and began to put it in the top drawer . " did sam tell you about this gun he had ? it 's called a pistol . the man
[384/1000]	" what ? " " whatever we do next , we need to put our heads together . let 's think this through first . " she glanced out the window at the busy street . " we can
[385/1000]	* * * an hour before they were about to take out the battery , the door to the suite opened looking like it had been kicked through by a mule . " thank you , i hope
[386/1000]	that was one of the coolest things about flying . there were other things as well . like the sense of peace and security he found when he drove over in her car or when he was close to
[387/1000]	" what ? " " well , since you guys keep yelling for me to open the door and get you out , i guess you and your friends were correct about my not opening the door . but
[388/1000]	he just shrugged , unable to tell her the truth . " she was n't your friend , kate - did n't even speak to you . she hated me . did n't you ? i 'd seen <EOS> ,
[389/1000]	" no way , " said claire . " he had a crush on you and you told him the truth . trust me ; in the end , the first thing your parents have to do is tell your
[390/1000]	i watched him silently for a few seconds , not knowing what to make of what he was telling me . then he asked , " who 's your dad ? " i blinked . this was n't the
[391/1000]	she glanced up at him and studied the line of his tense jaw . " what did he go and do there ? " " what do you mean ? " " when the baby was in your
[392/1000]	i had no idea what time it was , but it was one in the morning . i climbed out of bed and moved closer to the bathroom , so i could hear what he was saying . " there
[393/1000]	chapter eight * * * the next morning joe drove me to my desk . " well , how about this scenario ? will you work with me and my clients ? " " huh ? "
[394/1000]	if we all stayed together , we could escape this madness . if we did n't walk into the middle of these people , what chance did we have against them ? once we reached the end of the
[395/1000]	and that was it , he thought . we 'll never get any more of this , he assured himself , from what he 'd seen . not just now . and whether that was because he was holding up
[396/1000]	he was n't a fool . she wanted it . she wanted him so f * * king badly . then she heard the door to the stairwell shut and she felt her legs go out from under her
[397/1000]	" what is this ? " beth was starting to be a bit irritated . " a test , " ethan replied . " where are we going ? " beth asked . " there were a
[398/1000]	he looks from me to the phone and back to me . i have no chance now that i 'm here with him ; he 's got this big , cocky cop glare on his face . he has no
[399/1000]	" the last time i looked at this book had been before i was born . i never knew that there were so many . " " well , " she hesitated , not sure if she should continue
[400/1000]	i smiled back . " you 're such a sweet guy , and you have such a great house . " he gave me a little hug . " i know , but you 're no more than
[401/1000]	" and you 're sure that they did n't come here looking for their husband while they were on vacation ? " " no . a lot of people were staying at the hotel . and i gave them
[402/1000]	" what brings you to my cabin ? " he leaned closer , dropping the tip of his nose against hers . the warmth of his breath felt like a feather on her cheeks . " i need to
[403/1000]	she nodded mutely . " but you must be careful , " said grandcourt , after a pause . " i heard he has begun in three months , and wants a complete tour . " " that
[404/1000]	" can you really tell ? " she nodded and gave him a reassuring smile . " it 's like they are talking to you . " " wait . you felt them ? " " you
[405/1000]	" we should meet down here in half an hour or so . " " i 'd like that . my dad might be tired from the early morning , and i figured he 'd want to be here
[406/1000]	if that was n't enough to stop me , i had to go back to being alone . before i could get my mouth open completely , the elevator door dinged open and i quickly ducked into the hall .
[407/1000]	" yeah . i could use some coffee . " he nodded , and helped her from the chair . " you gon na stay for tea ? " he whispered , his eyes running over her . "
[408/1000]	" i love all of you , " he said . " i wish i 'd never met the woman , but if i had n't i would n't have met you at all . " " i 'll
[409/1000]	" it was too much to ask for you two to come , so i had everyone go home . besides , you were meant to be a part of this group . " " okay , that makes
[410/1000]	mr. ro sen thal and the other guards had n't known they were both going to be here . as the first prisoner moved to walk away , damon took a deep breath and caught her with one hand
[411/1000]	" i do n't know , " he told her thoughtfully . " you never asked . i might just - " " go up with me , " she blurted , and quickly slapped her hands over his
[412/1000]	it was n't the worst thing . it was a good thing . something had happened . and it was n't just something . it was something that was still not over , which was why i had driven
[413/1000]	" you 're acting like a cat trying to escape the house . " " that 's what i 'm doing . " " damn , but you 've got one hell of a mouth on you .
[414/1000]	he smiles back . we talk a little longer . i 'd like to say i 'm not looking forward to that , but the truth is that i 'm excited about me getting to spend time with
[415/1000]	" is the boy coming ? " " not yet . i 'll wait until he is . " " for some reason , i ca n't get your blood at this stage . " " it
[416/1000]	" this is her fault , " mary said . " of course it is , " i answered . " but you think it 's pretty funny as well . " " what is ? "
[417/1000]	" a wolf . have you seen him ? " asked jack in a voice that sounded like the voice of a little boy . " just my grandfather . he has a wild hair from old wolf .
[418/1000]	" i 've read all the papers . he 's an accountant who is a good friend of mine . " paul continued to examine me . he came to some conclusions about my story . since he 'd
[419/1000]	tom put down the cigarette he was holding and turned to the other man , " why would n't he tell us ? " " he would n't give any one a name . we 'll know it 's
[420/1000]	" are you done , " mr. george 's voice said from the window . " george ! get down here ! " we watched his footsteps grow more confident . " how long do you think you
[421/1000]	" yes , " said neville . it was only a matter of time . " so do you , as i said . " " well ... " said digger , who still felt the faint echo of
[422/1000]	" the last time anyone mentioned it , i was still in love with you . " he smiles at me and kisses my nose . " seriously . " " are n't we going to argue now ?
[423/1000]	the crowd hushed as they heard screams from inside the tower , followed by the crash of splintering and splintering of wood coming from inside the building . the guards in the wall were taking off their weapons and
[424/1000]	jason returned to the table and sat down with the rest . " ok , so what 's the good news , and how can we help ? " " first of all when the door got opened ,
[425/1000]	" i agree , " i smiled , " i am looking forward to it . but for the moment , i just need time and space to think . get my mind off things , and you will be
[426/1000]	" who knows ? " he shrugged . " it may be a bit of a nuisance and then someone does find out . " i shrugged . " it does n't matter as long as it does n't
[427/1000]	" i ... i do n't know , " vin said . " maybe i needed to feel happy . " yomen waved indifferently . " the gods have not always been that kind of people . "
[428/1000]	" i believe you . you were out for lunch on friday . " david nodded . he got the impression that she had something else and , no doubt , would n't give on . " and
[429/1000]	" but we ca n't be sure of that . as to our ultimate escape , " added the scientist , " i do n't know where or when , but it does n't have to be a public escape
[430/1000]	" and this is n't ? " " no . " " we 're leaving the rest of our camp behind on another ship ? " " absolutely . " " and we 'll have no
[431/1000]	there was laughter all around me . i was n't the only person in the cave listening . some of the kids started running after a rock that was already in the air , and some of them even
[432/1000]	she watched him carefully for a few minutes and turned back to the box she 'd set aside for the day . it was about two meters thick and half full of gold and crystal . it was going to
[433/1000]	" what happened to my necklace ? " " it got lost ... or something ... " " there 's no way you are buying that necklace , young sir . that belongs to my mother . "
[434/1000]	and the more i had been around him , the more he 'd become like such an open book . was i kidding about getting close to him ? i knew how much he 'd like it if i
[435/1000]	she giggled through her tears , but she was in no way laughing out loud . " go , go , go ! i know you will . i could n't stop myself . " he rubbed the back
[436/1000]	" what ? " " i said , he was too good to be true , " she said , smiling . she meant it . he was too good . well , almost too good . but mostly
[437/1000]	" oh no ? " " no , not at all , " david said , stepping up beside me and placing his hands on my waist , pulling me to his chest , and i felt the muscles
[438/1000]	we had gotten too much of her attention on me over the last week . she had n't wanted to talk to me last night , had n't been as attentive as i would have liked . after having woken
[439/1000]	the woman seemed taken aback by my sudden appearance . " you too . i 'm ellen . i 'm your manager at the hospital . oh , dear . you must have given me to see you .
[440/1000]	" i 'm not asking them to come out here , to come out here to hurt the humans , i 'm telling you to go up there and see your brother . " " i 'm not afraid
[441/1000]	" all right , folks , and since you do n't know my name yet , i 'm going to make it easy for you . i 'm sure i 'm not very exciting . no , i 'm not
[442/1000]	" i 'm in a way that i ca n't explain , " she said and told him the whole story . with only one thought in mind , she knew that she 'd done the same thing she 'd
[443/1000]	i gave a nervous laugh . " if i want to get laid , i can always ask you ! " a slow , wicked smile twisted her lips . " you have no idea how many times i
[444/1000]	" i ca n't believe how easily your little brother and sister were treated , " said mr. can twell . " i remember when i was younger , and my father would teach me how to make a cake
[445/1000]	" no problem . can you hold this ? " he held it out and i squeezed her hand when my phone vibrated . " hey , i 'm busy with a client . " " do you
[446/1000]	" thank goodness , i was starting to think you and your brothers were planning to kill me ! " " kill you ? " beth giggled . " sort of , yeah . i almost got eaten
[447/1000]	' my idea by now only works if you stand the candle on your desk in front of it . and my work is to get it lit properly . ' the room was in darkness . albert looked
[448/1000]	" of course . " i get up from the chair . ' the phone rings . " david says as i pick it off the nightstand . " hello . " all i can hear is my breathing

[544/1000]	" okay , " he said , still laughing . " you 'll be the death of me . " not too bad for such a huge man . she laughed as well and they both dropped into
[545/1000]	" you think he actually loves her ? " " yes . he does . it 's only been a year , but when he looks at her , i know that it 's there . if she came
[546/1000]	" so there 's only one way to find out . " " what 's that ? " richard asked , eager to have it over . " i 'm ready , " jason said . " and
[547/1000]	i 'm sure my face is a terrible mess by now , but at least they helped me leave . " where did you go ? " i ask . " why did you even have me come up
[548/1000]	" what is the name of the man you work for ? " asked paul . " thomas . i do everything in my power to keep my contract . " paul thought about her answer , trying

[553/1000]	" yes . " she looked up . " if there was a way ... " " i know there is . but i do n't know how . " tears stung her eyes . " why does

[558/1000]	the man 's voice spoke again ; " have your best men take the body downstairs before the police arrive . " " what if someone tries something , man ? i told you by the way , do
[559/1000]	" no . are you sure ? " " positive . you have to go to the doctor tonight . <EOS> ... get in bed , pick up to help me getting old . " she just stares ahead

[570/1000]	" you know , i was n't so sure about him when i made the vow , " she admitted , frowning . " then it seems like he did this to me , because this is the first time

[572/1000]	" maybe not , honey , but i thought you planned . i did n't think you intended to spend your time making excuses for your father . " she stopped . was she mad ? she asked him
[573/1000]	" yes , you do . " she took a step towards him . " although the idea of losing you has given me an idea . something from my past has led me to a very strong desire to

[588/1000]	" if she 's the one , tell her . " " yes , daddy , " she says , and giggles . a couple of people stop by my table and say hello to me and i
[589/1000]	a faint rustle of clothing and a thud told me she 'd collapsed onto her back . she smelled of perfume and sex . the sound of it was soothing , a voice like mine did the same sort of

[596/1000]	i went to the window and had a good look out as well . someone with a shovel was mowing some lawn . what if they noticed me ? we were the only two people on the street at that
[597/1000]	what was it about him that made me want him from the time he walked into the bar ? when we 'd first met , i thought we 'd never get together and i should have known better .
[598/1000]	" she 's my sister . did you know she was my sister 's best friend ? " " no . though it 's nice to know that she is n't as aloof as our parents , " i
[599/1000]	" i 'm not , " he said , his voice just as soft , deep , and so familiar . " i am just doing what i have to do to survive without you . " when he

[601/1000]	after we got the information we 'd been looking for , and did the full body check , then the two of us headed inside with his arms around someone else . he wanted to give the bartender something
[602/1000]	" i guess this means we can get out of here . we have to call the men and find out where we are . " " you know we do n't have any cell phones . can he
[603/1000]	with two dozen roses and a dozen cupcakes , i turned around and found myself behind the bar . they had just finished making homemade candy for the holiday , and i was just about to bring it to mitch
[604/1000]	" it 's a good thing you wo n't make a fool of yourself tonight , " he said , his hand stilling on my hip as i slipped my other arm out around his neck and leaned on him
[605/1000]	" you remember their faces . " the nurse looked at him nervously . " they are going to keep you overnight because some doctors want to keep an eye on them . " " hospital patients ? "
[606/1000]	' you think there might be one here , if so ? ' said susan , doubtfully . ' oh , yes , ' he said , nodding . ' you do n't think so ? ' '
[607/1000]	" oh , my goodness , she was the only one of us with a key . they had to have made a mistake . they were the only ones who could have given us away . if they had
[608/1000]	i did n't think he meant it . his eyes warmed warm and he said , " yeah . " " thanks , " i whispered . he pulled off his leather jacket and he tossed it
[609/1000]	" what about you ? you had a beautiful wife . " " i did , yes . " " and you had children ? " " yes . i had a big family . "
[610/1000]	" hey , " lucas said , stopping in front of them , " no offense " i waved my hand , " but your parents can see that you 're in love with me and this is n't the
[611/1000]	" you can take care of yourself . " a muscle ticked in his jaw and his eyes darkened . she swallowed hard . " it 's just the thing about you the other day , " she
[612/1000]	" yes , the three of us and an adult in this place , and one hundred men to help us out . " " i hope so . " " trust us <EOS> if these men ever
[613/1000]	and maybe this was what love looked like . i mean , did n't that mean that i was crazy about adam just because he 'd told me so ? i put my head on his shoulder , and
[614/1000]	another roar . another one . but there was no longer a sound . the power of his blood was gone , and his hands were no longer tied , and no one was chasing him .
[615/1000]	" it 's a matter of life and death . your sister , for one , must never know about this ... this world . " the eyes were wide and unblinking . " what happened ? "
[616/1000]	for a moment , they were shocked to hear him speak with such depth , but within seconds , he was on his feet and moving to the table . he looked angry , and a look of genuine fear
[617/1000]	" be careful . " " i will . " " i 'll bring you back as soon as i know where he 's gone . " she hung up with a click , and then the
[618/1000]	there was a creak that made michael jolt . he looked over his shoulder but saw nothing . but he knew what it was . a bed creaking . a piece of the tv . it was coming .
[619/1000]	" yes . " " the only thing that matters is getting that damn lock fixed , " he began . " at least it was my fault . " he stopped and shook his head , his head
[620/1000]	" you know you should n't treat me this way , " he said as he leaned closer . " i was n't trying to hurt you . " " i know that . i just ... i thought
[621/1000]	ethan shot it a sharp look , then turned and did a three point turn at my back , while i ducked farther behind the tree . he turned again . i 'd had it . not the best
[622/1000]	the guard turned and raced back to the building , but his back and arms were red . " shit ! " he shouted , slamming the door behind him . when the guard returned , he had the
[623/1000]	" how did you get hold of my name ? " he asked . " i 'm not taking my name out of a book if that 's what you 're insinuating . " " the rules do allow
[624/1000]	" that 's not what it is . " " do i ask you again to let me go ? " a chill went down my spine . this was it ... our time in private . i
[625/1000]	she looked into his eyes . " i never said i loved you , drake . " he looked away , to the trees at a distance . " i know . i did n't mean to scare you
[626/1000]	he looked at her and she was amazed to see tears glistening in his eyes . " i never meant to hurt you . i was trying to get you to listen . i was giving everyone else something
[627/1000]	" well ? " " yes , the first night , " i said . " when they locked me in the room , i was afraid they was arresting me for kidnapping . then when my dad showed
[628/1000]	" you look very handsome , " she said , and went to reach out and touch his face . " if anyone looked good enough for my son , " she added before leaving the room , heading for
[629/1000]	" i am . my mother is only the beginning of the cycle i want . life is full of secrets . " " tell me how she came about , and i 'll tell you what she did
[630/1000]	" okay . i 'm coming . " i go back to sitting near the bathroom door . i 'm thinking that a big bag of stuff full of random stuff is about the least dangerous of my assignments
[631/1000]	three men , one of which was the younger , thin - faced , red bearded man and the other , slender male , were gathered around the fire - pit , waiting for the ceremony to begin . he
[632/1000]	i stepped through the doorway and shut the door behind me . the room was silent , my body still vibrating with the need for his touch . i was getting accustomed to the power of someone who 'd just
[633/1000]	" because i wo n't let you have anyone else . you are going to have to take care of yourself , honey . " i nodded but was still unsure . " if you do n't keep
[634/1000]	" yes it is and that 's why i 'm here . i 'm going to ask your permission to help you break a law . " alex did n't say a word or even blink a blink as
[635/1000]	' ah , no , sir . just making sure sir . ' ' of course . good day to you . ' the man got back into the car and drove off down the street , leaving
[636/1000]	do i tell her ? i still think of her like a sister , the one who had been there for me when i had so many problems . she helped me with just about everything i ever needed ,
[637/1000]	the thing i could n't figure out was what - if anything - is in this place that makes me so afraid to be here . everything sounds like it 's in the wrong place - or at least i
[638/1000]	" i have some errands to run . will you be at your place tomorrow ? " i nod . i have no reason to ask his permission as i do n't know whether he can take care of
[639/1000]	i ran to the fire and threw his fire into it . it sputtered , sputtering into the night as we entered the snow . then , as if there were some signal i did n't see , flames rose
[640/1000]	" you 're right . come on , let 's go get cleaned up . you can tell me all about it at breakfast . " together they made their exit from the cabin and walked into the gathering
[641/1000]	the old man snorted but said , " he looks like he enjoyed doing it somehow . " " yes , " said torus . " there is something ... off about him ... one day he looked terrible
[642/1000]	" you do n't have to be a smartass . " she opened the door and gestured for my hand . together we walked by noah 's door in the hall and headed toward the stairway . " thanks
[643/1000]	but there i was with the wrong female . she was n't going to break like a stick that could n't break through water . she was more like an animal . " no , " i uttered .
[644/1000]	" and this is where it begins , " i said . " just like in the story the first brother saw joseph . he had seen him and was prepared . when he saw the first brother , he
[645/1000]	" no , i 've actually looked at your papers before . i think it 's a good idea . " " why ? " asked mark . " look , i do n't want anything to do with
[646/1000]	" where 's paul , anyway ? " " driving me crazy by keeping his mouth shut . how did he get hold of you ? " i shrug , " i threw him out in the street
[647/1000]	" i think you 'd be surprised . " " is that right ? " he grinned . " no . but my dad 's getting ready to retire . he thinks i need to get out of
[648/1000]	" hello , seth . i thought i recognized you , " his father said . " hello to you too , father . just wanted to make certain you are still here and that i did n't lose
[649/1000]	" how would you do that ? " " it 's the hardest thing , " he admitted . " can we sit down for a minute , please ? " " of course . " sitting
[650/1000]	" i do n't need him here , " she said , and my head snapped up . i had n't realized she was talking to me . and then the waitress got up and began to serve us
[651/1000]	" why not ? " " why not ? not nearly as many men like me as you have . i 'll keep you in my safe if i can . " his eyes widened . " you
[652/1000]	i should have been worried that she was going to be attacked in the other room . should have ... but i did n't even know where my sister was . i did know that my sisters ,
[653/1000]	" of course , i - " he 's going to shoot me on sight ! the thought of one of these creatures in this neighborhood . i 'm so frightened . how long could i last ?
[654/1000]	she nodded . " yes . i was wondering if you knew of a bank account that you might use , one in which this man may have a small interest . " the words " what do you
[655/1000]	the one part of it that was n't happening , that i was n't feeling , was all of my imagination . i hated seeing him like that . to have that beautiful beautiful face and those sparkling emerald eyes
[656/1000]	" so you 're not into the dancing side of everything ? " " uh - huh . " i nodded then said , " we wo n't be doing much dance , so do n't worry about
[657/1000]	the words were as real in his mind as if he were reading them aloud . " your mother does n't have to speak with me . not only is she the goddess of the hunt and the hunter
[658/1000]	" no , you have to trust me ... " " and trust you . " there was a long silence . they had made it out alive ... then , he thought , the sun has come
[659/1000]	" do i need to leave ? " " nope . wait . i will be out in about thirty minutes . " he hung up . " just what in the holy hell is going on
[660/1000]	" hey , " came the startled reply . " what 's wrong ? " " nothing . " " <EOS> what slipped in the bathroom ! " all those times on the long trip . "
[661/1000]	i glance back at the building . no lights are on . " i 'm getting a ride so it looks like we 're missing something . let 's take a walk . we can talk about it there .
[662/1000]	" how 'd you know there was a party going on here ? " olivia shouted . " some people here are going to come up here and throw an opening act on the dj . " he leaned
[663/1000]	" thanks . i will . " we stood there for a minute . " well , we are friends , are n't we ? " i asked . " yes . " " then i think
[664/1000]	" yeah ... but that was before we started the tour . " his eyebrows shot up . " ' we started the tour , ' huh ? " " yeah . i could n't take <EOS> ...
[665/1000]	he lifted his dark eyes to look at her and the air seemed to leave his body . not just with fear , but with relief . " <EOS> a big deal , " she said , making herself
[666/1000]	" and that 's what you want ? a woman to play on your family like that ? the least you can do is answer one question for me before you pass out . " he leaned to the
[667/1000]	' i 'll bet it 's just as well ; as i said the night before , no one could leave the estate with that many men around . i 'll see to it for you . i can
[668/1000]	maybe we should all get some rest . for my part , i was enjoying the evening with everyone . it was the only time during which i was alone with my thoughts of the last few nights that
[669/1000]	a pair of hands reached past me and grabbed the back of my head , yanking me down for more leverage than as a natural reaction , and my teeth snapped together on his fingers . sam moaned low
[670/1000]	" no . she 's a human , something different from us , she 's been here . " " what makes you say that ? " he looked at me and then back at the road slowly
[671/1000]	* * * * * * * * * the next morning found max and max alone in their hotel - max had said not an hour and he 'd ordered , he 'd ordered right after waking up
[672/1000]	" you 're kidding . " he held up his phone . " i 'd love to get in touch with the girl on your door . " i rolled my eyes at his attempt to in flate their
[673/1000]	i took a step back . " i ... did n't know about that ... " i trailed off . he nodded very slightly . " it 's a good thing i 'm handy . " i laughed
[674/1000]	' i 'm not a very good actor , ' she admitted as she poured some whisky for them both . ' i should hope not , but then it 's <EOS> yet he had such a day that
[675/1000]	" i - i just love hearing it , " he corrected . " that sounds f * * k. that ... just sounds just right . " they talked for a while longer - a lot of the
[676/1000]	" yes , sir . " " can you arrange a visit ? " " i can . " " if you 'll keep working on it i 'll transfer the money into your account . i
[677/1000]	" i 've been working long enough on this and for the last couple months i 've been working on my new school schedule . i saw the way coach is looking at you . it 's weird how you
[678/1000]	" okay . " " go and bring me up some toast . the first day we were up there , there were a half dozen guys at that table . it was about the same for everyone .
[679/1000]	" what ? what is it , mac ? " " you told me that there was a reason for everything i do for you . you told me that there were times when i had to stand aside
[680/1000]	something was off about the moment , a nagging ache in the pit of his stomach reminding him it was about to be snatched from him . " maybe something 's wrong with this picture , " he said
[681/1000]	" ok . i 've made a decision , but it 's too late for any hasty declar ations . if you do n't want to come with me , i 'll understand , and it wo n't matter ,
[682/1000]	" where is he ? " she asked . " off in the woods , " said a short man . " just like the other day . running , " said jack . " where in
[683/1000]	" in ... you know ? the game ? " he smiled . " yes , like i said . i need to protect you . " the laughter faded out of his eyes . " i do n't
[684/1000]	" no . i mean , no , i 've only heard of dracula . " he glared at her . " and i just happened to share your thoughts right across our shared dining room table , where
[685/1000]	it was clear they were n't going to get any sleep tonight , so they decided to head east , on campus , as fast as possible , and see if they could find any way of tracking down sam
[686/1000]	i did n't want to sound like i was talking about getting sick of being drunk . " that sounds right . " she replied . " want to have some dinner ? " she asked shyly .
[687/1000]	" you do have a knack for lying , " i told her as i handed her the water bottle and took two fingers out of my fingers . i handed her another . " it works on the road
[688/1000]	" no , it was the worst torture he could imagine . " the man 's shoulders drooped in defeat , his face filled with shame for having to suffer the abuse he experienced while he took his son
[689/1000]	" okay , but first take care with your dad . do n't let anything happen to him . you promise me , " i said as i rubbed her back . " i promise . so , what
[690/1000]	" we both need to rest and plan . " he raised the palm of his hand and slowly opened his eyes . " can the pain set in ? i do n't want anything to interfere with this .
[691/1000]	" can you do anything else ? " daniel asked , worried that he 'd done something wrong . i just shook my head at him and began to walk towards the dorms . i could feel their gazes on
[692/1000]	it was only then that he noticed the broken window , and that his initial impression to her was complete . he stood and made his way over to her . he sat down , waiting for some sort of
[693/1000]	" so , " she said to lily 's question . " he only has seven kids - none of them sisters . " oh , yeah , she thought . of course he did n't have cousins .
[694/1000]	" no , son . i got it , " nathan answered softly , his voice breaking with her heartbreak . " i 'm not , " she quickly countered , her voice cracking and her hands fumbling with
[695/1000]	" that 's good to hear . " " listen , the kids at school will be over tomorrow , and they all seem like kids from a different time . it may not be any fun for the
[696/1000]	" the king just got home from a weekend in san francisco . " " oh , " i said . " i 'm sorry . " " yes , i 'm with an aunt in new york
[697/1000]	i nod slowly . " you do this a lot or you do it a lot , " she laughs , " when you 're mad you really are mad . think of it like a game to me
[698/1000]	chapter 29 when they returned to camp the next morning mary was so fatigued she did not even bother to give any further thought to the injured as they were dragged by their feet to camp for the day
[699/1000]	he nodded . " yeah , i see that now , " he said . i was silent for a while , breathing through my nose . was it too much to ask him to turn me loose in
[700/1000]	" you mean like the last time you saw her here ? " " never . i was just waiting for the right time ... the one you could n't forget . she never forgot us . but now
[701/1000]	" you did n't do it , " he said simply . " you 're like my mom . she 's an alcoholic and does n't want to be a mom , mom . and you , well , you
[702/1000]	her lips curved into an involuntary smile . " i knew you liked it . the bastard who was the first man i was with could n't resist me . " my cock was as hard as steel ,
[703/1000]	who would hire him ? if you knew her , you 'd know she does n't work for a tabloid . then a face popped into my head . that must be what she thought of me . she
[704/1000]	" come here . " her arms gave up and she let him pull her into his arms , cradling her and rocking gently to the soft rhythm of his heart . " the words " love , " '
[705/1000]	" you said you were going to do a job on his office , " i pointed out . " what could be deeper than that ? " " more than it would otherwise be ? " "
[706/1000]	" sure . you want me to leave her to die ? think again . " now it was his turn to laugh . " why should i ? " " because i want you to . "
[707/1000]	' tell me that 's a good idea , ' she said . ' why not ? ' ' it would be a nice kiss : ' she bent to kiss him on the lips , but he
[708/1000]	" she 's a grown and wise woman , " he answered her . " what happens if she decides to stay ? " she had asked . " you get off the grid . you disappear .
[709/1000]	" let 's go , " shane said , and took her hand . she turned to go , but just as she opened the door , she heard this soft , haunting voice call . " they
[710/1000]	my heart broke in two . i loved my husband so much , and it hurt so much knowing that he might not see me the way he wanted to . the old me would've been running away like a
[711/1000]	i 'm sure , her thoughts said , but her nose only flared a little as she concentrated hard on the other words she had written . " of course . it will go well . " " would
[712/1000]	" i 'm sure she 's in a bad way , " i assured them , and the girls moved down the hallway as i spoke . " she 's obviously upset and could really push you to leave her
[713/1000]	" and now ? " " and now ? " " and now ? " " and now ? " " now . " " and now ? " he rested his hand on
[714/1000]	' i think you 're trying to figure out how this all works . ' what ? could it be possible ? i mean , i need a good friend , someone who wo n't tell anyone anything .
[715/1000]	he is so gentle , so incredibly loving , and i want to kiss him like a fool . the last thing i want is for him to want less from me than the kiss he just gave me ,
[716/1000]	" uh ? what ? oh , yes . " he nodded to the front door , where a tall willowy blonde in a black suit was exiting . when she saw cole , she pushed the door open wider
[717/1000]	they found a place at the edge of the clearing and dropped to the ground , going back through the leaves and bark to the hut . just inside the doorway was the small gray body of a girl
[718/1000]	" they do n't give people too many ideas , " jeff told her . " no offense , but if they do n't , they make people think differently . " " not the reason i came
[719/1000]	without giving him a chance to say another word , she headed into the bathroom and closed the door . oh , i was crazy , she told herself <EOS> and then took off her apron and left the
[720/1000]	" just relax . i 'll be back in a minute . " " are you sure ? " " positive . " he was trying to be reassuring , to reassure her , but claire was holding
[721/1000]	" how you hold that gun is the other reason i 'm calling you . " " your police license and information are here . " " oh please , let it go , i have no intention
[722/1000]	" wait . let me check in with the captain . " " thank you . " the captain turned and strode past him as if the topic had n't been on the air in a few moments .
[723/1000]	" but she is so fragile , " robert objected . " of course she is , " his wife replied impatiently . " she can handle herself in her new role as mother , now and then she
[724/1000]	there was a moment 's silence while we talked and my stomach grumbled . finally , i said , " uh ... probably a little . " and that 's when lucas turned on his heel and left .
[725/1000]	but , unfortunately , there were <EOS> just a few hundred , maybe a hundred and some more for the journey to the future . she had yet to be able to feel anything real inside <EOS> too , and
[726/1000]	it was easier this way . " good , now look how easy it is . " she met his gaze and saw the familiar sense of excitement in his eyes . he wanted her , too .
[727/1000]	" it looks good , " said the inspector . he looked around the hotel ballroom , seeking a corner , and ran into a slender woman dressed in a red - and - white plaid gown , red
[728/1000]	chapter twenty - two i know i will say no more on this subject , but i have n't had time to read <EOS> f * * as a moment for one . for three weeks . i feel
[729/1000]	" of the world 's most beautiful things , and the most glorious pleasures . " he said a few words and turned away from her . " but let 's not go there today , let 's just
[730/1000]	he was breathing hard , and so was she . their eyes met , and for a heartbeat they stared at each other . " and you 're just a little ... strange for a human , " he
[731/1000]	" can we go back and see the other parents now ? " " are you kidding ? they 'll never believe it . " " they know my brother was kidnapped by dark magic , right ?
[732/1000]	" how ? " he said , sounding genuinely perplexed . there was a brief pause as i considered my choices . " let 's just say i 'm not up on a good doctor 's visit . "
[733/1000]	" sorry , i just ca n't be , i feel pretty awkward talking to strangers like i do , " i said . " i do n't even know why i 'm here . " " relax ,
[734/1000]	" i would have , too . that it did n't bother you . " " i do n't do much out of pity , you know ? " " tell me about it . i really hate
[735/1000]	" no . " she held the phone away from her and looked at her surroundings . " i guess i should get back to the room . it was nice meeting you , jack . " " wait
[736/1000]	" thanks , dad . " i was completely taken aback . " i 'm glad you 're feeling better . " i smiled at my dad , patting his hand . " i 'm sure he wo n't
[737/1000]	' well , i ai n't seen him in hours . ' there was a rustle of the grass next to the tree . ' so , he 's no longer in this world , then . '
[738/1000]	" have the guys been able to speak to you now ? " " not if you count that little argument they had with me about the new rules . " " i doubt that because the fact
[739/1000]	" i am trying to save her . but i honestly do not have the power about the sword to save her . " the god 's eyes narrowed for a moment before he went silent once more .
[740/1000]	" they were on a date and , since they were off , they were in love . it was n't just another big break , either . i was the guy they walked down the aisle with , and
[741/1000]	" like an island between a lake and a sea ? " he made that little noise again , soft and soothing that always made her stomach flip . " or a island between a white harbor and a
[742/1000]	" do you not wish for me to write a letter to my uncle ? " he stopped at the window and turned back to her . " or to give you the letter ? " the question was so
[743/1000]	the thought of giving my body to any human again , human or not , sickened me . i rolled over to face bo . he stood behind me and was studying my neck with an expression that did
[744/1000]	he ignored me and pulled me off as the sun burned the sides of my face . " you were lucky . he 's still alive in there . give his head a chance to get clean . " he
[745/1000]	" they 're out in the field watching the game , " connor said . " they 're not going to notice us much if we leave . " " i heard you , " i said . "
[746/1000]	" i 'm not even going to ask why you let out this story , " i say . " i 'm just going to say that i know what is going on , and i 'm going to help
[747/1000]	" i understand . " " good . i 'll see you out . " he stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind him , then turned and gazed out the side window . the sound
[748/1000]	" yes , my darling ? " but i was n't sure if he understood . " you did n't want me to eat you in the car , or at dinner , or anytime during the day .
[749/1000]	" do it in bed , " i told her . she went to the guest room we shared , and with the phone , and the remote control , she clicked it on . " just a short
[750/1000]	" of course not , " said mr. march dale . he was as satisfied as he was surprised to find that nothing was lost . " is there not something else of good fashion about it ? "
[751/1000]	" i 'm sorry . i 've been holding out on you . " she said nothing . the sun glistened from the roof and splashed over the windows . <EOS> , it glistened . she closed her eyes
[752/1000]	" yes . " " how did it go down with tom ? " " in any other way , he had to die , and it was n't his fault . " " if he 'd
[753/1000]	the next morning , it was like the sun had risen over the rolling hills . a woman appeared in the doorway . eleanor 's breath caught . " is it my birthday ? " she asked , crossing
[754/1000]	' take me to the hospital , ' i said . ' now . ' mrs roman had started to cry . i could take her the wrong way round . ' i think i 'll sit here
[755/1000]	" so what i said . " he took a deep breath . " i know that if you go and fight the witches , you 'll have to be on your best behavior . " " i 'm
[756/1000]	" what do you want us to do ? " he asked . there was no denying what he wanted her to do . she did n't want to come clean and risk hurting him too much . she
[757/1000]	you do n't need me to say the rest . " he 's a bad boy who 's wanted for murder and arson . " she shook her head . a pause . he took one step toward her
[758/1000]	" yeah , they got rid of all the zombies left for you outside when you tried to wake up , " i say , not really wanting to keep lying about it anymore than i already have .
[759/1000]	" we 're not , " she assured me . " and do n't ever call me son of a bitch again , " i warned him . his head shot back and his body jerked as if
[760/1000]	in the early morning light her eyes fluttered open . he 'd seen some sleep , but not as much as he 'd hoped . he did n't look like himself when he rose . his skin seemed too pale
[761/1000]	he was a total ass * * le . " that 's not this , " he told her . " it is and it is n't , " she retorted . he rolled to his back
[762/1000]	the man smiled , the one with the scar . " that 's because you 're getting it where you probably do n't want to . " " oh .... " she had n't even noticed that his scar
[763/1000]	the man turned his head awkwardly . " well , i , er , just bought some bread and wine , to let the men get their strength for a little while . are you certain you are all right
[764/1000]	" are you going to stop me ? " his chest is heaving , his eyes focused on mine . " i gave you your way . you get an , you get a . you 're not buying
[765/1000]	her smile , like a promise of something nice and very yummy , made ethan feel hot and cold at what looked like an all night party . " do you want to come in ? " it was
[766/1000]	what a time to have one of our favorites come in on the week . it was as if none of the guys were there . it was good to see them even with a guy i did n't know
[767/1000]	" good , glad to hear it . " she walked out of her room and sat down in front of the television set . she turned the volume down a bit because it was so early . she was
[768/1000]	" it was nice to meet you , mr. griffin . " i nodded and cleared my throat . she followed suit , and when i saw the way she smiled , it made me wonder what i 'd
[769/1000]	he 'd told her he wished she 'd left him in the grave . she 'd said something about not wanting to be alone , wanting to share the pain she carried , not wanting to lose the love that
[770/1000]	" you need n't think i 'm not . " " oh , i do n't , " she said , then she glanced past me to the dance floor . i had n't noticed a couple dancing a
[771/1000]	" the whole time i worked on your house , " meredith said . " i told you the story of me and my sister . " " that 's right , " bonnie said softly , with a
[772/1000]	" it 's none of my business . " she looked him in the eye . she thought he looked handsome . he was tall , and had the big , soft body she remembered - so damn big
[773/1000]	" if he 's staying with some girlfriend , what is this " - he pauses to scan the crowd - " what is this ? " a few guys in suits - and with a guy with
[774/1000]	i frowned . " are you serious ? " his eyes shifted to me . " seriously , is she a liar ? " " i would n't call you a liar , " i agreed . "
[775/1000]	there was a murmur of laughter from four different points in the room and a growing murmur from the rest of the room . eventually even the president began to notice the commotion , and then started to rise from
[776/1000]	" i 've been wondering that myself . i 've tried and tried to get them to respond , but they refuse to talk to me or work any harder than necessary . i 've called in half of every
[777/1000]	" i could have sworn i see a person 's face . " he sounded unsure . " a man ? the man with the hair . " she said helpfully . " why would a woman come
[778/1000]	the light from above flickered off , making the shadows shift as it passed . they were still the same , still the same , the shadows , but now she could see them more clearly . it was about
[779/1000]	it 's good to see you too , my baby sister . " she nods , knowing full well i 'm here for the long haul , and i can take her pain or bring it back every so
[780/1000]	" no way . you do n't find this a cop - out scenario ? " " it 's kind of scary . when we go down , there would n't be any witnesses that we could use .
[781/1000]	the three figures made their way through the town . at first the street was deserted and quiet . then several cars drove along it . then , a man popped out of one car . he wore a heavy
[782/1000]	" you can lie but you ca n't tell . " " we just stopped at this coffee shop around the corner , " he said , then said , " i 've been working here for a few
[783/1000]	i 'd almost taken that step . what i probably should have done were say goodnight to mr. ankh and leave . for most of my life , i 'd been a criminal . a killer . a good one
[784/1000]	though he would n't admit it , jason was glad not to be confined to his cage for the foreseeable future , when things turned bad , his brothers were the one who should be getting in the thick of
[785/1000]	" you 're saying we make a terrible team ? " " i 'm saying i 'm not sure that we could ever succeed . i 'm not sure that we 'd ever be really good enough for each
[786/1000]	" we 'll just find her , " sam said with determination . " we 've spent the last two days trying to make the best time you were able to have with him . i know you 've still
[787/1000]	this was my last chance . and it was a good one , so i focused on it . and then i stopped thinking a few seconds later because his eyes were on something and i knew it was
[788/1000]	" really ? " he nodded . " no way could i have gotten her alone before she was almost comatose with blood loss . i know from the accident that she had some kind of bad case of
[789/1000]	i put on the jacket . i did n't have a jacket . because it was raining outside , the collar on my jacket was up , but i tried to make the jacket warm with the rain slapping on
[790/1000]	" i think i 'll get a bottle of wine . i brought a book for you , too . would you like to come get it now ? it 's about the people in the movie line and movies
[791/1000]	" good ! " said s rea k ula , and smiled as well . * * * * * * * * * * " it is the greatest wonder of your life . where are
[792/1000]	" yeah , " i said . " so ? " " so tell the chief tomorrow , " she said . there was a tap at the door and deveraux got up and i put her coffee
[793/1000]	the professor cleared his throat , and i turned back to see him eyeing the professor who was standing across the room with a knowing look on his face . " so , as i was saying , "
[794/1000]	" yes . " " would you talk to me , do this , please ? if you really wanted to , i mean . " " you 're my best friend , the one who is always
[795/1000]	" i heard you were looking for a horse , " he said , in response to my quizzical expression . " what , you heard the latest in the race ? " i nodded . " well ,
[796/1000]	" shit , " he breathed , finally . they 'd passed the place where he 'd f * * ked her so badly the night of the carnival . he 'd been outside , f * * king her
[797/1000]	" i love you , lucy , " i say . he winks at me and then pulls the covers back , revealing my nak * d body . " want to watch this ? " i shake
[798/1000]	my stomach was hurting even harder , and the thought of telling my mom what i thought of her . i could n't make a decision right now . it would kill her if i had to . i
[799/1000]	" why do we want him to get shot ? a human could be killed ! " he thought it over . " he 's human , and they are humans . people with emotions . " she
[800/1000]	i look at my hands and realize that the way i 'm hanging on is to get caught . " thanks for the compliment , but i 'm afraid my intentions are n't like all the intentions are . "
[801/1000]	" i do n't know , " she said . " i 've only been here a couple of times . when i first arrived i was all nervous about the trial . but then it seemed like it was
[802/1000]	" what happened to the other one before i met you ? " " it 's not me , really ! " " who was it ? " " well , it 's not as if you
[803/1000]	" you want to give me a kiss , " he demanded , leaning in . her head jerked up , but she did n't blink . " what ? " " can i kiss you ? "
[804/1000]	" i like that . " " i too ... after i get a shower . " " do n't think about it , i thought of that a lot . and when we 're done , i
[805/1000]	" do you have any idea how long it takes to learn about anyone else i love from a book ? " she was amazed that the words were true . it was as if the universe was communicating them
[806/1000]	" he 's gone , " the man behind the desk informed her . " i was the one who brought up the baby . are you from the embassy ? " " no , " she said ,
[807/1000]	his fingers tightened on mine , and he pulled out to the next dip . " i 'm sorry . " i moved my fingers back and forth in their own rhythm , trying to force out more of
[808/1000]	" you ! they 're just asking questions because they want to know what the deal is with your sister . are you still in jail ? " the detective 's voice was dripping sarcasm . " you 'll have
[809/1000]	do what ? " her voice rose over the blare of machines and machinery , as she tried to figure out what they were saying . panic had her pulse nearly jumping out of her head . you can
[810/1000]	" i 'm a lawyer . i get paid to play . " " but what the hell do you want ? " " i 'm a lawyer , " she repeated . " no shit .
[811/1000]	" fuck . when are you coming back ? " " now . " " how about right now ? call me first thing the next morning . it 'll be a much more direct schedule . "
[812/1000]	" it 'd be nice if you 'd do your job for a change . you 'd have to move out of here . " i almost groaned . he was talking about moving . of course he
[813/1000]	the doctor had been right . she was a bit frail . she turned on her side , a fist full of hair hanging down her back . she said , " he left a message that he 'd
[814/1000]	" what the fuck is going on ? ca n't you just call her back to me ? " she asked desperately . he was furious with her now . it was like he was having problems controlling his
[815/1000]	i gave up trying to work it out and got out of bed . i had to be at work at 7 am . i hoped that would be enough time he would n't get over me , but he
[816/1000]	" are you one of the local cops ? " i asked . " no , we 're not . " she told the cop that he would have to go and get her bag . he waited until
[817/1000]	" yes . " that was why she did n't think for a moment that this was her father . he did exist . perhaps because she 'd never really seen him before , yet sensed his
[818/1000]	nick and i fell into the rhythm of old , familiar life , playing and dancing until my knees went rubbery and i almost collapsed . then i stopped . nick kept on dancing , twirling and twirling until
[819/1000]	" what you hear is different . " he swallowed . " no . i hear it 's not . " " how ? " he shook his head and looked around the house . " i
[820/1000]	" oh . " " where are you headed out to tonight ? " she asked . i knew that question was coming . i hated to lie to my friends , but it was one i should
[821/1000]	she could n't tell his expression from hers , but after the time she spent without an orgasm , she knew she was going to have one . the second he heard the word " no " his mouth
[822/1000]	" i do n't think i 'm any good for you . " she chuckled . " if we 're gon na go out , it might as well be right here , babe . " i kissed
[823/1000]	she smiled . " it 's time to go to sleep for a little while . " he picked her up , cradling her in his arms , and she fell asleep as he carried her into the house
[824/1000]	' he 's lucky he 's the one with the talent for it . ' ' oh yes ? ' i said , ' he came back from the dead . ' she closed the book and
[825/1000]	" i remember . i was only twelve on my fourth trip through the continent . the first time i was in the states . " i took a deep breath and focused on the ocean beneath me . it
[826/1000]	finally he laughed . " you should n't be here anymore . " " i 'm not , " i replied , and walked away . i climbed into grace 's car and drove to the shop
[827/1000]	" what are you talking about ? where could he be ? there 's no one here in this house . " " tell you what , son , " ethan stood up and turned toward the stairs .
[828/1000]	because this is his world . it 's his home . it looks like a castle in comparison . it appears nothing else matters - not right now . and the feeling is intoxicating . he imagines him inside ,
[829/1000]	" the old man has a good heart , " said luxa . " your father is better for his children than he is for his own . " gregor 's head was whirling with what luxa could just
[830/1000]	" do n't touch that ! " the girl cried . " but i wanted to ! " the little girl insisted . " do n't touch her ! " " are you crazy ? " she
[831/1000]	" you know nothing of that ! " the woman shook her head , smiling . " my son is of the noble blood of the mayfair family , from a distant line of his family , your own house
[832/1000]	" yes , " he replied . " it was . i could even take your name . " " no . " " why not ? " " i like it . " it was
[833/1000]	" nothing . " she 'd never had more than a vague memory of an alley - filled alley lined with garbage cans and garbage bags and graffiti . every single week , too ... until her mother had
[834/1000]	" my heart bleeds for you . for lily . for your parents . for the world . " cole looks stricken at the admission . then he gives a sad smile . " i feel the same way
[835/1000]	" it 's a matter of people seeing us , and people seeing me . any questions ? " " what were you doing in a nightclub in the first place ? " she stared at her left
[836/1000]	" you might want to hide . " she motioned to her dress and shoes and the water bottle . " the water is a lot more warm than you would like . " she grabbed her gun bag from
[837/1000]	i felt nothing ; there was nothing and i did n't see the faces around . my mind was blank and all i could think was i wanted to be alone . after what seemed like a million , the
[838/1000]	" if you need a distraction , let me know . i 'll be busy checking up on you . " her eyes seemed to clear . " we 'll talk later . " she turned and was gone .
[839/1000]	" but we have to talk about this . you just got over another girlfriend . " she shook her head . " she was someone i knew in high school . " he moved closer . "
[840/1000]	" thanks , " i say . " i get to play with a little girl and she ends up scaring the crap out of me . " " her name is marina , okay ? " he says
[841/1000]	" it did n't hurt you . i just did n't want to give you a hard time . " he sighed and pushed himself up on his elbows . his eyes were distant , that look that he
[842/1000]	' i wanted to go to paris , ' i said , sitting down on my kitchen bench . ' then why were you out last night ? to meet with those stupid french guys ? ' '
[843/1000]	" yeah , but not quite fast enough . " she lifted her shirt out of the way , but her h * ps automatically pushed tight against his hand . he did n't even have to look to know
[844/1000]	" i love you so much . " " do you want to be with me ? " " yes , " i whispered . " of course you do . " he traced my knuckles . "
[845/1000]	" um ... " i trailed off . " i hate to say this , but the only way you could find a guy who would do that kind of thing was if you let him take credit for
[846/1000]	we have been running most of the day , as usual , and no one has called in a search party . " where 's my car ? " i ask as i look around for it , which
[847/1000]	" it looks so much better back here . " " i do n't think so , " i said . " but it will . " we walked in silence back to the tent area .
[848/1000]	" yes . to a house . to a woman . " there was a pause , as though she was debating whether to say something else . since i did n't want the conversation to get personal ,
[849/1000]	but what about the big , scary , black , shiny , vampire - looking man ? could he even be real ? " do n't you find her ? " she whispered . the words were just out
[850/1000]	" why would you do that ? you love him and we love him . " " you do n't understand . " i shook my head . " i do n't want to be with you . i
[851/1000]	" oh , " claire said , and felt panic for her twin . " oh , god , what if mom - ? " " it 's not your fault , " eve said . " the point
[852/1000]	now i know that i 'm never going to understand what is going on with him . the same guy , these past a * * holes , is the one who is always pushing me or holding my hand
[853/1000]	" why a kid ? " " let 's ask the rest , shall we ? " " yes , " she said , turning around . for a moment paul thought she might scream , but his
[854/1000]	i ran the knife down my arm again . the blade sliced through flesh and bone , but felt nothing . i could feel my wound being cleansed by the blood of the two creatures who had killed me
[855/1000]	" can we walk this way ? we have a lot to check . " " the answer is no . " we had no choice but to walk . " well , the name ' joe '
[856/1000]	his hands were at a near awkward five - point position as her grip on his hand tightened . " he 's dead . " her voice was gravelly , tinged with a harsh note of regret .
[857/1000]	" i know . we 're looking toward something . but that wo n't change any time soon , " she said breathlessly . so she was n't giving him all of it . it did n't change the
[858/1000]	by the time lunch rolled around , emily felt like everyone in the school was trying to get a piece of her tongue . even her favorite guys , who sometimes had the annoying habit only of running away to
[859/1000]	she studied him for a moment . then she gave one last , reluctant glance at his body , and they broke apart . " i 'll see you later , " she said , sounding polite .
[860/1000]	the little girl , who was wrapped in her blanket , looked at rosie as she appeared , then smiled broadly . " i found him . he 's okay . he says he wanted to go to the beach
[861/1000]	" i 'm in love with you , " she said instead , and i gave her a smile . " you have been and i love you , " i said , and she sucked in a breath
[862/1000]	" me , me , me , " i called out , tugging at his towel higher , tugging at his skin , bringing it down so much i had to suck in a sharp breath to hold it together
[863/1000]	" yes . " she was too late to stop me as i kissed her . my tongue slipped past her lips and slid inside . she tasted hot and exotic . her small hands met my body .
[864/1000]	she took his face in both hands . " if i do n't - " suddenly he kissed her . it did n't take long for the light , sweet passion to take over . the passion would go on
[865/1000]	" hey . you know , right now i 'm no hero , but i 'm not stupid either . you know what you have to do . what do you have to promise to protect yourself from ?
[866/1000]	" just get her to the plane to meet up with us . i promise you , " he said to me . " i 'm sorry , daddy . i 'll be there as soon as i can
[867/1000]	" my father ... i was so much more than he was . " daniel looked up from his sandwich and rubbed his eyes . " you know that . " he cleared his throat . " why do
[868/1000]	" yeah , ok . " i put my head on her shoulder and we both lay there in silence for a few minutes . i sighed and let go of her and looked at her face . she was
[869/1000]	" i 've never gotten to see two people who love each other who i would have put their lives on the line for . " she leaned forward and kissed me , pushing my cheek with her lips
[870/1000]	" well , in that case ... " michael let himself yawn and turned toward the apartment . " you two had a good time tonight . no need to let us spoil it for you two . "
[871/1000]	i looked up at him . " me too . " oh , he was cute , but i did n't want to end up marrying a demon . " when will you let me know when you 're
[872/1000]	" you do n't mind , do you ? " " no , no at all . " " well , i just wanted to say thank you for taking care of me and my mom <EOS> too
[873/1000]	his words and his body hardened like it often did when she got close around him . he pulled her body against his so that they could hold each other . " i missed you . i want you
[874/1000]	" my friend . " she said . " remember when you asked me what my name was ? " she grabbed the sleeve of his overcoat and pulled him closer to the face . " when i told you
[875/1000]	" would you like to talk about what you 're going to do with it ? " alex asked again , not bothering to put down their food . " this is something i 'll have to think about
[876/1000]	" you do n't have to stay here with me . it 's fine . " " no , i need to go home and pack everything . " she tried to get up , but her leg was
[877/1000]	" no , " he answered , and with a nod , turned and followed the nurse out of the room . alex closed the curtain before the doctor came back in and bent to her . " as
[878/1000]	" yes , i had a heart attack last night . i was sick pretty bad . " she shrugged . " i 've also had a rough day . " " i 'm glad to hear it ,
[879/1000]	" we are in the living room , but your family is there . " he left the room . " i was going to ask you if you wanted to discuss this outside . i know i

[881/1000]	he gave her directions to his motel , then got out of the car . sara watched him over the top of her sunglasses , then carefully locked the car . she walked <EOS> right up in a moment ,
[882/1000]	two things struck as they passed along the highway , one in the centre and one in the distance , the one where they were headed for . it was clear that the country was getting worse and worse everywhere
[883/1000]	" he really does . " " i really did n't know what to do . what if he kills me , or someone else ? " " you 'll be fine , darlin ' . "
[884/1000]	" this , too . he was about twelve . and both of them were about me . " her brows drew together . " why ? " " he just seemed protective . " maybe not that
[885/1000]	maybe we want what we have when i am my own man . " " how did that happen ? " she sighed . " two years ago , my mother got a call from a friend .
[886/1000]	he was holding out his arm in invitation , and i went to take it from him . i shook my head as i stepped closer , feeling his closeness as nothing would ever feel anything but an inch from
[887/1000]	" we wo n't know until we try the old place , " agreed philip , " but until we catch them , we might be able to help . i 'm going to give you our card so you
[888/1000]	" it 's not that i want to talk about it . i just wanted to know how you 're doing . " logan 's words were short and he started walking again . " look , i went to
[889/1000]	as soon as you 're all settled , i 'm going to go down in the room and bring you all back some decent coffee . " he gave a loud laugh at the last sentence . " are
[890/1000]	' no , ' sparhawk responded in a bored tone . ' will you show me something ? ' she asked , moving closer . ' all right . ' ' you are what , sixty -
[891/1000]	she kept her eyes narrowed . " you had sex with him ? ! " " yes ... " i sighed . " that 's the only way to explain it . " " but with him ?
[892/1000]	" you 're not going anywhere , " i told him . he kept his nose from my neck and his eyes . still in charge of the conversation , that , i had noticed , was his way
[893/1000]	a few minutes later we stepped out onto the sidewalk together . it was warm today , and the sun shone brightly at the top of the mountain like it always did . everything else seemed quiet and empty .
[894/1000]	" <EOS> " and so forth , i thought . " i had to be prepared for a fight to the death with old man winter . he has a lot of years on him , i guess . "
[895/1000]	" it was just the usual routine . i figured you 'd remember . " the sun had moved on and the ground had become a hard , shiny surface . rachel kept her gaze locked on james .
[896/1000]	" i had to learn . " " really ? i did n't know you 'd gone through that many . " " i used to live in st. petersburg . i came to washington about ten years
[897/1000]	her cheeks flamed with hot color as logan 's hot gaze rested there . he knew damn well how to turn on the charm , but she 'd almost lost her appetite . " you 're beautiful when you
[898/1000]	i 'd never been with anyone so much before . i wished my world could be as easy , so i could reach out to him , to touch his skin and feel the connection of our bodies . only
[899/1000]	" yeah , " he said . " i guess you 're lucky to have her like that . " he pulled her to him and kissed her , a heated , eager kiss . she moved her hands
[900/1000]	" that 's it ? you did n't think about it ? you 're getting ahead of yourself . " " i do n't know ! " i cried in exasperation . " i do n't have another body
[901/1000]	" do not worry , " said a voice nearby . " we will find your son . that is all that matters . " chapter eight gregor had the feeling someone else was speaking to him ,
[902/1000]	" hey , guys , " said jason . " who 's holding up the hood ? " all eight guys went quiet . then one of them blurted , a tiny squeak of a laugh caught in his
[903/1000]	" not really . " mr. jackson leaned his elbows on his desk . " no , i can see it in your eyes . you 've spent most of your life not seeing anything . " i
[904/1000]	when they had eaten , he made her promise to tell herself never to get close to the man again . no more sex . no more games . but it would help her process that he was n't the
[905/1000]	he walked away , saying , " you take the next flight back to australia , " then left . * * * " that was n't so bad is it , " sam said to me in
[906/1000]	i laughed lightly at that since i 'd given him the creeps in the first place . he would have been absolutely adorable if that had been his preference . " okay , you 've got my attention now .
[907/1000]	" what you think about my proposal ? " the man asked , his stare never leaving her lips . " um , okay . " he held out his hand . " my name is thomas .
[908/1000]	' i can not resist . they are not much as i thought and i know you remember what they have done . ' ' so now what ? i 'm not getting better ? ' asked bond firmly
[909/1000]	" what i did was wrong . i did n't realize , in all honesty , that i was going to do that . i let out an angry growl and grabbed my purse . " " where is
[910/1000]	" what on earth do you mean ? " she was sure the answer was going to be important , but she 'd find out for sure after her mother drove her to her work . " mom ,
[911/1000]	" why is there a light switch ? " he asked . " you did n't have a problem last time , so you have to switch on the ceiling bulbs . i should 've just removed the
[912/1000]	" i 'm not afraid , " she muttered when he reached the door . " good , " he replied , his tone un compromising . " now , take your shirt off . " " i
[913/1000]	" you mean , was this your idea ? you told me you were having a girl to be with only for me , did n't you ? " " honey , " she says , " i always
[914/1000]	" wow ! " the girl was looking like an eagle . " she really does have her own secret place in the zoo . " " i would n't go that far . " rachel said smiling ,
[915/1000]	" it came as one of my most personal shocks when you stormed into my apartment that night . " he 's keeping his distance , putting off the conversation for now , but the edge he used to give
[916/1000]	" well , go <EOS> . let 's finish off the rest of the pack and get out of here . i think we might need them for some fresh meat . " a pack of wolves , at
[917/1000]	he was right . i ca n't do it by myself . he stopped walking then and stepped back . " i missed you , " he said . " damn , i did n't think i 'd ever
[918/1000]	" i 'm just too upset . " the words tasted like ash on my tongue . " it 's okay , " david said , pulling me into his lap to sit as deeply as he could while
[919/1000]	i shrug , " no , but as you know , i 'm a very old lady ! " i notice that my old man is in the far corner of the kitchen laughing it up with that elderly
[920/1000]	his lips spread against hers in a smile . she felt his fangs . at the same time , the roar of an engine sounded just past the gate . " i 'm sure they 're busy
[921/1000]	their breath caught , and she had to stare at him because he actually blinked at her - and the gray eyes stared back . the stark white face , the sharp jaw , the black hair . "
[922/1000]	" so , what gives ? " " well , we do n't know precisely how long her schedule will last , but there could just be minutes when it 's free . " " why not ?
[923/1000]	" so , that little trip to georgia by the lake , " she said , " you were there in the helicopter ? " " it was so ... unexpected , " he said , " i could
[924/1000]	" i ca n't believe we had to make the trip , " she said and started to cry . " what 's wrong ? " " i did n't have plans - not since you left ...
[925/1000]	" i have n't heard that one from you . are you in trouble ? " his face hardened for a split second but then he recovered , and in an instant he was back at my side . "
[926/1000]	" is that what this is ? " asked roger . <EOS> " you want me to keep it ? " jerry had said " you must understand this ; i will not ask you to be alone with
[927/1000]	i got up , wrapped my arms around her , and kissed her forehead , pushing her into the pillows . " go to bed , bryn , " i said once i was able to take my eyes
[928/1000]	" ' just a bit of teasing ' ? " he laughed . " i 'm not sure why i 've taken a turn for the worse . i 've had our first week working together so far , but
[929/1000]	he gave her a strange look . " this is it ? " " you and me ? " " yes , all of us . " he kissed her again , their lips brushing , and then
[930/1000]	he took our coffees to a table and started making a cup . then he started talking again . " i did n't get a real good look this mornin ' . nothing from jacob , at least
[931/1000]	" i do n't care about that . " jamie shook her head and backed up . " why is she ... " her voice trailed off before she had the words out . evelyn shrugged . " i
[932/1000]	" i had a hand in the last act , it could have gone badly for him , perhaps we can stop it but do not underestimate our friend . " " i have never seen " "
[933/1000]	the fire finally died down ; the cave was silent . the warriors did not move a muscle for a moment , then a loud shout was raised , " the young woman has done nothing , " was shouted
[934/1000]	chapter twenty " why do you cry to me , dad ? " dad was asking . " how could i tell him ? his loss is unbearable ! " " he 's a good man , josh
[935/1000]	" thank you for that , " i said , meaning it . he nodded . i felt him glancing to where alex was standing still . " hi , " he said . they both turned and
[936/1000]	" i just had to make sure that it 's really yours , " alex promised him . " huh , " charles murmured , glancing at sam 's hand . " what about the flowers ? "
[937/1000]	" no , no you did n't do anything to me , " i responded through a dry throat . " it was a joke . you were playing some one - on - one game of monopoly that you
[938/1000]	we get to the front doors , and she does n't say anything at first . " i want you to tell me your name and address . " my brows rise . " do n't you
[939/1000]	what were they supposed to do ? leave and hope that they never saw your face again ? " and ... that 's why ... after only a few weeks , the story got ... bad . you do
[940/1000]	he pointed down to the ground , at the wet spot he 'd left at her feet . i picked up the plastic bag and dug a quarter out of it . ' stop him , ' he
[941/1000]	" how am i going to do that ? " i asked as i thought about my mom picking up her cell phone right now . " well , you 're going to give me your phone number so
[942/1000]	i stand up . " it 's not your fault . " " do n't tell me it 's my fault . i know better than to believe the word of a doctor who refuses to acknowledge the existence
[943/1000]	she 'd been so sure that her brother would still be working the factory - to not run his boat and crew full time , but not to give up - that she 'd ended up making the mistake of
[944/1000]	i nodded . " yeah , it is . " silence enveloped us , except for the sound of her breathing . she might not be out of the woods yet , and it would n't be long -
[945/1000]	i went home with the thought that after much searching i could return to my old life and i felt much better . and it did seem a little strange , considering what my job was the very next day
[946/1000]	then a flicker in the back window . and the unmistakable sound of a man cursing . a man who 'd come up the stairs to the second - floor hall to answer the door . a man carrying a
[947/1000]	his phone beeped in his pocket , and he pulled it out , frowning . looking at the screen , he saw he had ten missed calls : two from the house , and one from ella , and two
[948/1000]	' yes , ' said ezio . ' and while she 's watching you , you will see a sign in my hands . it is called an alle gor ical sign post . it states : " the
[949/1000]	" i know . you 're having a great time and we better do this , because if they find out that i 'm sleeping with you , they 'll probably take away everything . i know that ... we
[950/1000]	not a good night . " why do you call everyone ' sir ' ? " i asked . " because we are not civilized . the first time i fought a group of our own we were
[951/1000]	chapter 47 when i woke the next morning , the sound of an engine echoed through the house . it was not the sound of rain or wind , it was the echo of a distant motorbike . to
[952/1000]	he leaned up and gently kissed her again . she came with one more deep , passionate kiss , giving him everything he 'd wanted and more . he wanted to memorize her taste , smell her , and feel
[953/1000]	he laughed , and she watched in fascination as his expression became dreamy and dreamy . his body shifted as his head tilted back , and she watched him close his eyes as he arched himself to the rhythm of
[954/1000]	" you 've got to get her something to eat , and i 'm a big boy . " " yeah , well go find something on the road so you can be on it . " "
[955/1000]	" that was a big mistake . why did n't you call me ? i would've been here for you . " " i know . " she paused . " did you talk to josh about this ?
[956/1000]	i had no idea what these were , and had no clue what to do . i was so lost in these thoughts that i did n't take them in or notice the sun getting lower right away , so
[957/1000]	i stare down at my hands . " you remember the accident ? the crash . it was n't my fault . " he glances up , the lines etched around his eyes deepening . " we all remember
[958/1000]	" this is where i would know it was . " all around her in the small square of sand that stretched out as far as the eye could see , the city was shrouded in clouds and bathed in
[959/1000]	" then what ? " he continued . " i 'll stay right here . the moment you leave , someone else will leave , too . " " someone else is going to be left ? "
[960/1000]	" stop . " " yes , sir ! " she took a step back just as another ball came toward her . it had come from behind the building . the ball hit her shoulder and ricocheted away
[961/1000]	" i think so , too . " but she was n't so certain . if the woman had known the specifics of what had been going on today ... " they 're just going to lie to us .
[962/1000]	a door down there opened , and a man stepped out . " can i help you young fella ? " " yes . have you seen mrs. de br acy ? " " i 'm sorry sir
[963/1000]	but none of any of it makes any difference . because no matter how much he wishes it , john would never have to know . the moment john begins to cry , his tears are replaced by little
[964/1000]	" that kind of looks like it , " i said , " and i 've seen a lot of books . i mean how many books are there in a library ? surely you had to have a library
[965/1000]	his mother was still looking at him . " what will happen , dad ? " she asked , her eyebrows raised . " your mother and i are n't sure . we 're not sure at this point
[966/1000]	his hand hovered over the phone . " what does ' please ' mean ? " there was a pause . " it means , that if you decide that playing the game with me gets you
[967/1000]	" how can you say that ? " said torus . " you think there 's so much more to come when we get home ! " " i think there will be , " said chello . "
[968/1000]	he stopped and looked at her with his brilliant sapphire eyes - the look he got when he had a woman he was not about to let go . as always , that was the one man who could get
[969/1000]	" do you mean to tell me that someone in this world would be willing to risk everything for one who died and i 'm not even supposed to know about ? " his face seemed pale beneath the dark
[970/1000]	" i 'm sorry , i did n't know you ... " " all right , why do n't we get started . you told me about you and your friend . what happened ? " " we
[971/1000]	he felt a deep regret . he felt the loss of the baby and there would be no coming back . " come here , sweetie . " he could feel a hand on his shoulders . they
[972/1000]	" do n't tell you what to do ! " i heard them shout . then i was under the stairs , outside their tiny apartment . they were the only people still standing here alive . my mother and
[973/1000]	i blinked at the strange look on my friend 's face . " what ? " she took a step away from the table and dropped her voice . " the name on that name is john . "
[974/1000]	" why not ? " " i do n't have to explain , " he muttered . " she must be up to no good . " " you do n't know that . what do you know
[975/1000]	then , right before they were both down on the ground , claire grabbed david 's collar and looked him back into her eyes . her hair was ragged and blond after that . not curly , like david 's
[976/1000]	" i know , but you need to be at a party at my place . " " like ... tomorrow night ? " he smiled . " not exactly , layla . " it took me
[977/1000]	" no . i was the one who told them i had been doing it . she wants me to learn how to do it all . let me help you , kylie . " that 's what mom
[978/1000]	" not much choice . at least you do n't have very many of your own . i 'll figure out a way to go to the local library and find out what will help . " sarah gave tim
[979/1000]	he smiled . " a very hard man , a very handsome man . " still holding fast to him , she started to protest . then she caught the glint of his eyes as he slowly pulled her
[980/1000]	" the king thinks you 've decided to join the rebels , " the king said . " i have n't decided . i 'm going to get here as soon as i can . " the guards
[981/1000]	' oh my god , what about the whole thing ! ' ' i lost it . i got ... sick , i guess . ' she ran her fingers through her black hair , which grew short as
[982/1000]	even with the windows closed and the rain pouring down , the wind went wild . my hair could hardly stand it anymore ; it slid down my back and danced over my shoulders . the driver pulled onto
[983/1000]	' i think you could be my dad , ' she said dryly . ' you look so much like my ex and your looks are like his . a little more dark . a lot less handsome . '
[984/1000]	" i knew it . " " so where is this store ? " " it 's called the new owner 's store . " " why ? do n't they sell stores there ? "
[985/1000]	" what are you doing ? " he looked so adorable my heart fluttered . " i 'm taking you home , kitten . " " that makes me sound ... bad . " " you 're
[986/1000]	no one could come , of course , so i could go to the police straight away . but in reality , i was grateful that they were there , and that i would n't have to be confined to
[987/1000]	" i could n't tell you , " he stated . " but you knew my name , " i insisted . and i really had n't wanted to see his picture , i thought as i wiped back
[988/1000]	mr. k emp ner placed his gun into the briefcase and slid it slowly out of the top drawer . he flipped the files over in his hand and opened them one by one . he flicked through them
[989/1000]	this time he found himself leaning toward her and reaching for her shoulders . his chest was hard beneath her palms and her br * * sts were crushed between them , the tips hard with want . her hand
[990/1000]	the first time ethan made me come was the second time he made love to me at that table across from where we were now . we 'd been looking at each other over the open space of the table
[991/1000]	" maybe . if you do n't mind me saying so , that 's really good . " i pointed to my stomach . " it is really good , too . " he laughed . " are you
[992/1000]	what was it with men that their lives were always so complicated ? yes , she had been a bit emotional , and yes , she 'd been a bit freaked out herself . but one thing she was
[993/1000]	" yes , " she said simply , feeling her heart swell at his words . then she glanced up . he stood watching her impassively , a frown marring his brow as his brown eyes flicked across her
[994/1000]	she sat up and laughed . " i do n't have any hair ! " i jumped and started laughing as i reached down . when i noticed that she was laughing as well , my heart instantly filled
[995/1000]	i held on to the ledge with one hand and turned on my elbow to rest my head on his arm . he curled his arm around my waist , careful to push his body flat against mine . his
[996/1000]	she saw one of her old men drop into place beside him , and she got up quickly . she went to the mirror and bent over , looking for a gap in the curtain , but there it was
[997/1000]	the phone was ringing , startling her , and she sat up , blinking at it . " hi , " she said softly . he frowned as if he was reading the caller id . " can
[998/1000]	" you 're right . i 'm sorry . " he stared down at her with his dark eyes that revealed nothing . " is that what you want ? " he asked , and yet she made herself
[999/1000]	" it 'll be fine . you can take it when the baby 's asleep , " i said . i left them for the next ten minutes , and i 'm sure they made a game of making
