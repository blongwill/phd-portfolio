[153/1000]	" you are in my arms , " he states as he crushes his lips into mine . " but if you start feeling that way then i wo n't make our moment memorable . " i nod and
[154/1000]	" i know . i 'll work on this . " " sorry to see this , " said mr. sanchez . " i should n't be much of a surprise , " i said . " she
[155/1000]	" i did . " the pain in her voice was all the confirmation he needed . " you took care of her , did n't you ? " he asked from his position in the corner of the
[156/1000]	" what 's that ? " i asked . " it 's a new year 's present , " he said . " in your honor , mr. hammond . " he told me to sit and he
[157/1000]	" a - a - a - a - t - i - s - o ? was that you . you 're back ! " " hi , tom . come on now . " he swung open
[158/1000]	" i ca n't get word to him . " " have you talked to him ? " i hung my head . " no . " " have you talked to his mother ? "
[159/1000]	" but you 're not the only one looking for this new life that 's so near , " said rachel , with a playful snort . " i like it . " " good . i like
[160/1000]	" thanks dad , i think so too . " he said as he placed his hands on his hips , " do you expect someone to come up here to knock on our door , saying anything
[161/1000]	" get back to the room , sam . " " what ? " " i 'm doing this now . get back here , and i 'll be back to carry you out when they leave .
[162/1000]	" there are many other ways to make a wolf , like opening a grave . " " did you hear about the one after i died ? " " no , what about it ? "
[163/1000]	" not this one , " he replied , giving her a swift rub along her arm . " i do n't think so . " " okay , you 're probably right , " he agreed simply
[164/1000]	" damn , " i mumbled . " you 're thinking it . " i glanced down at my feet . we were going to have to be quick . " in the living room ? "
[165/1000]	i had only been making sure i was safe enough to stay upstairs , and that was the extent of my plans . chapter eighteen the boys were surprised when i did n't come out a few minutes
[166/1000]	" i 'd do something with that . " " if you do something with that , i 'm not sleeping with it . i 'm not asking for much out of you . " this shocked her
[167/1000]	" i 'll try , captain , but i do n't want to get more than a couple of weeks . " " there should n't be enough leave left over to make the trip on time . if
[168/1000]	a knock echoed down on the door . " open up , " a scratchy , male voice yelled . " please ? " the door opened , and a tall , skinny hispanic guy ushered in his friend
[169/1000]	he watched the police unit drive away . he could see its lights moving with the tide while the sirens continued to wail . a little later he decided to return to his office . the sheriff looked at
[170/1000]	" it 's just because my name is ' jack ' now ? " " right . you really have no idea , do you ? " he looks over at me . his eyes are dancing with mischief
[171/1000]	" well , i understand <EOS> had to face death being a good deal of time with me , but the rest of them ... well ... have been in a life or marriage or someone else , if you
[172/1000]	the woman at the desk smiled and nodded . " mr. o' sullivan will see you now , right away . " he smiled again and left . i sat down , staring down at the laptop . when
[173/1000]	" he 's with me , " he said , his eyes still locked on her face . " he really is this time , " she argued . " he 's been here all day and he called
[174/1000]	he could n't wait to tell her and get the address . she deserved it , for whatever had happened while he was gone . but his mother could understand him better than that , given the circumstances .
[175/1000]	but i shook my head . " nope . " " so are you going to sleep after the dance tonight ? " " maybe later . tonight i have work to do . " he shrugged .
[176/1000]	" i could get some , " i said . " you 're not feeling well right now either . " he was still staring at me , and still his eyes glittered with power , just as his
[177/1000]	" yeah ? " " yeah , " he says as he leans in to kiss me . he pulls away and looks me in the eye . " are you sure you want to do that ? "
[178/1000]	" you know i 'd love to , " he said . the three of them walked together down the path , toward the beach . they stopped near the edge . on the bottom of the pond was
[179/1000]	then they rode along together . at last , the trail narrowed more . they stopped for a drink , and the light of the moon shined down over an endless stretch of green toward the distant mountains in the
[180/1000]	" okay ! " emma called , " let 's try and decide what we 're going to do next ! " " yes ! " said everyone at once . " and we need to know where
[181/1000]	" not really , not really . that is to say i ca n't be sure yet because i 've only been here five minutes . " " did you drink anything ? " " no . why
[182/1000]	now they were talking about a different guy . that was unusual . usually other guys talked about me . i tried - and failed - to let it go . " okay , so it was a
[183/1000]	<EOS> " are the rumors of her illness to your liking ? " " yes , " he replied . " is there something you want to tell me which is the truth ? " when he
[184/1000]	" damn right it 's not ! " she does n't even notice that my fingers are still locked around hers , she barely notices my body pressing against hers . she knows the rules , and she takes
[185/1000]	" that 's right , " he said . " i need a good five seconds to recover my thoughts ... or the consequences are worse than i 've heard . " i pulled off my shirt and knelt
[186/1000]	it was a good day . the sun hung low on the horizon , the afternoon was gone . it was dark enough for me to keep my footing , so i was doing so . i did n't want
[187/1000]	" i 'll go too . " " thank you , ma'am . " she smiled and walked out . while i waited outside i watched her walk out of that restaurant . i watched her in fact
[188/1000]	the men all laughed . chapter two the men in the blue shirt john had arrived at the red rooster an hour early as he planned to pass on around the river to get the best price
[189/1000]	chapter 18 my stomach rolled in disgust . " all this ... for a drink ? i 've heard you 're a pretty bad shots kind of guy , cade ... what 's the rush ? " cade
[190/1000]	mr. court len nodded and nella was left to wonder how many men judge hawkins had been dealing with in the past few weeks . " in addition to all the work , not to mention our other cases
[191/1000]	" does this help keep you from thinking that you 're a freak like my mom every damn day ? " she asked . " because i know you 're innocent in all of this . i remember what it
[192/1000]	she 'd told him not to touch things because it 'd be a terrible mistake to leave such a mess . she thought of all of the ways he 'd hurt her and felt the anger burn in her stomach
[193/1000]	" the good news and bad news , " she said . " good news is that he 's doing better and he says it 's a broken rib <EOS> real hurts like hell . the bad news is that
[194/1000]	" have you told her that ? " " i have . " " christ , " i said . " when ? " " she wo n't be okay without you . " " but
[195/1000]	" and why are you talking to me right now ? " i was n't sure how to answer or how to answer the question . i liked seeing her smile , liked that this thing between us would
[196/1000]	they both nodded , letting their voices dwind le from his sense of self to his own sense of time . " i know , " she said at last , her expression still melancholy . " i am
[197/1000]	" i 'm here , you know . you should trust me . i 'm sorry , i just - shit , i miss you so much , nick , " she cried , not even caring that she was
[198/1000]	" what did you do ? " he asked , his eyes on my face . " she walked out , " he admitted . " where is she now ? " i was still trembling when
[199/1000]	" do you think that any of my words could come out with that look ... any of my words ? " " nothing . " " thank you . " his lips curved into a smile .
[200/1000]	if i 'm going to go out with a man in a dress , i have no desire to impress him . so i throw on my dress and my new clutch and make my way to the elevator
[201/1000]	he turns around to face me . " you need to get a bra in . " " a bra ? " " yes . bras are sexy and sexy . " i take a deep breath
[202/1000]	he felt she had seen him , but she did not move , at least not in his direction . ' i need information about who did this to you , and how they did it . '
[203/1000]	" that 's a great idea , " he said . " by now , it 's been a while . " he shook her outstretched hand with such tenderness , she felt an instinctive desire to comfort him .
[204/1000]	the demon 's dark hair , normally cut so short it barely grazed his shoulders as he wore a dark gray shirt and jeans . he rubbed the back of his neck with one hand and stared off into space
[205/1000]	" of course i - " i spoke up . " i 'll check all the rooms , " he interrupted , " but i know where all the bathrooms are , so no harm , no foul .
[206/1000]	just then , john appeared at the door and let himself into the room with a flourish . with effort , henry could not hold back the next smile that came to his lips at her beauty , and his
[207/1000]	i looked down to see that he 'd dropped the apple into his lap and was staring at my toes so he was n't staring at my shoes . " yeah ... i guess you 're not that far off
[208/1000]	there was a loud crash on the terrace behind us and the three of us turned around . the little girl , who had been lost in her own world of fascination , had suddenly realized that she was dreaming
[209/1000]	a few days later , he was called back to his office again . " i ca n't see you , " he said shortly . " i do n't expect you to do this for me ? "
[210/1000]	" i 'm sorry about that . sometimes men just ca n't be left alone . " " how 's cole ? " rae asked rae , ignoring rae 's question . " cole 's fine , "
[211/1000]	" there 's only one thing i can say . " " okay ? " " have you ever been to the moon ? " he nods at his computer . " because if you have
[212/1000]	" okay . what next ? " " okay , maybe we should go to the coffee house . i think i think i saw a sign on the highway . it looks like a coffee store . "
[213/1000]	she frowned . " it 's not my fault you were n't there . my dad was my friend first . " " the first one , " he corrected , " but then i took my girlfriend to
[214/1000]	" i ca n't keep them , " hannah said . " i know , " he tried not to sound disappointed . " mom , you ca n't and you know it , " she said louder
[215/1000]	" let 's not go up there . " her eyes shot to my hand , my ring hand . " i need to get to my car , max , " i told him . "
[216/1000]	" we 've got those <EOS> and a lot of things to overcome the most powerful ones . that one was where i should 've had to think to find you . " " just exactly how do you
[217/1000]	" yes , well , like i got up so early , so i could run around with my friends . " " you must have the best running class in the world , " she said .
[218/1000]	" you do n't take out your fear on animals ? " " are you kidding ? i 've spent my whole life planning for and doing things , and i 'm the one that picked up the weapon
[219/1000]	now , with her mother and the others standing around her , she felt an urgency to leave . but the fear was already spreading from the group , taking her by force of will . soon everyone was panicking
[220/1000]	he looked back as if to say why are you trying to do this to me ? and then he blinked , looked back at me , then back down to the road . " that 's why i ca
[221/1000]	" we 'll take you to my cave , " said the dwarf . i thought he was joking , but instead he said , " our cave ? then i will call you my friend and you will call
[222/1000]	it did n't mean i needed her , did it ? just in case ! " i am a good guy and you are probably afraid of me too . " she said . i swallowed . i
[223/1000]	and it would never be the same . he could n't remember the last time he 'd had a woman who affected him like this . not since his father had come into his life . no sooner had
[224/1000]	" i do n't know about the other shit yet . wait till i give the word , okay ? " he said . after leaving the dining room with his heart in his throat , he found the
[225/1000]	she 's my mom and she comes from a family of psycho paths and demons . although not a demon , she 's also still my mom . my family . we talk for a little longer , getting
[226/1000]	and he was right there in her arms . she had n't expected him to touch her , but he had . the heat of his skin caused goose bumps to rise . " it 's beautiful out here
[227/1000]	" i 'm so worried about you , " she said , and i nodded . " how are you feeling ? " " achy . and achy , " i admitted . " you okay ? "
[228/1000]	his voice was harsh . " and you 're making me insane . but what are you going to do ... now that you 're a queen ? " she lowered her chin and stared straight ahead . "
[229/1000]	" yes , mrs. abbott . a man ... a servant ... he might have been there last night . " miss adler 's face fell . " you do n't think ...... " " it might be
[230/1000]	she looked up at him and smiled . " yes , i do , " she said softly and closed her eyes . she had to admit something to him . if she gave it to him , it would
[231/1000]	" that does n't make me feel any better . " " well , it 's what you 're used to feeling . you 've been handling it yourself for a long time . i knew it when i
[232/1000]	" where ? " sean shook his head , his body and voice fighting for control again . " back at his old home , " connor said curtly . " i got here as fast as i could
[233/1000]	a couple of seconds of silence filled the space , allowing this to play out . then all four men were speaking at once . " the blood , " they said . " the scent . " "
[234/1000]	the doctor did help her to her feet . " please remain where you are . i 'll speak to her . " " help ? yes , please do . " " hold . " he crossed
[235/1000]	" do n't start , " jack murmured , kissing me on the cheek before backing away . i felt the tension that had tightened all evening seep through me and i closed my eyes . the sun
[236/1000]	there were other ways to find out who she was . other things they could do . but all of that stopped as soon as she met his eyes . his eyes were a mix of darkness and warmth
[237/1000]	" can i ask you something ? " " sure , darlin ' ... " " did you like it ? " " yeah . i did . " " and i have no complaints ?
[238/1000]	" i do n't know . i like it here . everyone likes it . but i do n't know . even if it 's just a little , i do think they 'd like you here . you 're
[239/1000]	and the way he had to tell her , her mother had made her feel like the odd one out , which was ridiculous because she could never be very odd . mom loved her and wanted her to be
[240/1000]	i think i 'll start up the grill . " " why do n't you call joe ? " " what ? " " when we were at breakfast . " now he looked surprised .
[241/1000]	" you got a better idea ? " " i do n't think so . " her body throbbed , throbbing louder and louder until it was impossible to tell what <EOS> " stop to the emptiness .
[242/1000]	" if you 're doing double time , you should get it together . she was trying to find a way to take a chance while i was n't there . she 's not going to come after me ever
[243/1000]	" you know , " he said without a hint of annoyance , " it 'll just be the two of us this time . " you know . " yeah , i know . you can think what
[244/1000]	" i had thought the same , " i said weakly . " i 'm just so shocked . " it was very funny , really , when you think of the whole scene of thomas and anne falling forward
[245/1000]	' i saw it with my own pair of eyes . it was huge , and it was , even lying on the ground , with my hand raised in the air , so close to the ground that i
[246/1000]	he turned back to his work . a man sat down beside me . a small man , perhaps six or seven years of age . he looked familiar , but i could n't place his expression . he
[247/1000]	" it 's what i came and told you . what my orders are : to show you where i get my information and to do it as quickly as you can . " " we have some time
[248/1000]	" but it 's not possible for you to be in my bed . i 've forgotten about you . " his smile made his eyes twinkle for a moment . " that 's a really big , enormous
[249/1000]	" we used to be friends first . maybe it had something to do with the timing . i have no idea that part . " " just remember , he 's dead and you 're still alive to
[250/1000]	" well , i 'm no friend of yours either but if you would n't mind i would appreciate being able to find one up and make a phone call . " i held out my hand for the cell
[251/1000]	still , she was going to feel the need to do so in the morning . " what are you doing for a full day ? did you get in ? " " no night . no day
[252/1000]	" a woman can read us , " he told her . " we 're not like any other people you know . " was he crazy ? to really give her up ? her eyes narrowed and she
[253/1000]	i shook my head in denial as he pulled away and went further down the hall . once he 'd closed the door behind him , i cried out again before i said anything . " why do you put
[254/1000]	" as you wish , " he lied . he was n't sure why he pretended being so interested in seeing beth 's sisters , though he knew she was n't far from him in more ways than one .
[255/1000]	" that 's not true . " " have you ever actually kissed a woman ? " the smile faded from his face , and he shook his head . " we only knew each other for a
[256/1000]	" what 's the matter , jack ? " he blinked and stared up at her , his lips slightly parted . " i - you look so ... beautiful . i did n't think you 'd ever look
[257/1000]	" yeah , when will you be back off the wall ? " tom replied . tom was silent for a moment . " i do n't know . like a few more years . the army and army
[258/1000]	a sudden breeze played through the trees , bringing forth the fresh scent of young , white flowers . trees , i thought , that i knew so well . but i did n't see the beautiful forest , just
[259/1000]	" but she 'll come back all right , wo n't she ? " he nodded , staring at the blank wall . " of course . " " why ? what happened ? " " she
[260/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " we 're the first respon ders . " " so what did he have to say ? " " we 're not sure . " " well ,
[261/1000]	slowly , ian lifted his head and looked at her across the table . she was looking at him expectantly . " is this going to take <EOS> both of us ? 'cause i do n't mean us getting married
[262/1000]	" i do , but i still 'd like to spend one more night here before i left . " " we 've got to work on how to get permission to leave the cave at all times ,
[263/1000]	his hand came out to brush a strand of my hair off my cheek . for such a tall man , he seemed capable of touching me . i swallowed hard , unable to deny him anything . "
[264/1000]	you 've been there . twice . you know how fast the damage gets done . " no , " he said . " i remember . we met on a job . in a bar . it was
[265/1000]	" good of you , " she said . " how do you know him ? " i said . she folded her hands under her chin and let out a long breath . " he taught me
[266/1000]	' you have n't been talking much , have you ? ' ' i have n't . ' ' that 's got been really difficult to talk about all the time . ' ' have i ?
[267/1000]	" did n't i say you should n't have had a drink ? " he demanded angrily . " i need a drink . " a scowl furrowed his forehead and he clenched his teeth . " i
[268/1000]	" i see . " " no , you do n't . believe me , the man is on his feet and on his feet before i can say fifteen minutes ago . " " how could you
[269/1000]	" that 's just it , " i say softly . " i have n't been cured . " i stare at my hands , at my palms , then the bed . for a moment i think i
[270/1000]	but he was on his feet before me all the same . he said , ' you 're a beautiful girl , you know that , right ? yes ? ' and he left . all of a
[271/1000]	i had a few things that i needed to do first . it would n't be easy , and by this time tomorrow , i 'd already be in the house with my best friend , watching a movie .
[272/1000]	" no ... no , no , no , ... what did you say ? " " the same thing i said about coming out here to help you . we look forward to that visit . "
[273/1000]	she still did n't seem to get it . " so , all i need to know is , are you attracted to me ? " just as she opened her mouth to answer i said , "
[274/1000]	" what do you think of me ? " her eyes were still red from the tears . " i 've liked you since you hit me , " he said for about the tenth time . "
[275/1000]	" i do n't want to think about that , babe . " he brushes my hair from my forehead . " it is too depressing . " " i was talking about the baby . " he
[276/1000]	" it did n't look like nothing until i started breathing again . i thought if i stayed away from will now , nothing would work . " so the question was for me to leave . it helped
[277/1000]	" i am . she has found a group of vampires in seattle who are staying there . they are the vampire hunters . " " why are they going there ? " " because you warned us
[278/1000]	a loud banging in the back bedroom jolted her out of the surreal past . her heart slammed into her ribs and her pulse beat faster than ever before . a second bang followed , but soon after that
[279/1000]	the sound of the car opened and started up , but one look into them made me reconsider my earlier opinion . the big big dog barked and licked a dish . " good girl , go inside and greet
[280/1000]	if she had been a couple of feet behind him that way , she could have easily been mistaken for a dancer . but she was much shorter than him . " your hair is longer than i remember .
[281/1000]	it took a few minutes for me to convince her of her own innocence . " it was because of you . i always knew you said ' no . ' " and there it was . an in
[282/1000]	that 's what he had said to me . a lot . i did n't know if he meant a good morning kiss or a bad morning sex of the heart . i had been so sure of either
[283/1000]	" are you certain , mom ? i can tell because you never went out to dinner before . " " i 'm very certain about that . and yes there are other people who have agreed to do
[284/1000]	" are you sure ? " " oh , i do n't know , if that 's what a mother wants to hear . is it that you want to know that you can trust me ? "
[285/1000]	" if i could , i 'd take you to mexico right now . but you 're safe here in this house . i 'll handle this . " " you ca n't always keep me safe . besides
[286/1000]	as she made her way out of the house , " i bet the little tramp . " the voice of the man to her right was also on the path , but she could not tell anything but the
[287/1000]	" look , " meredith said , " i do n't want any part of this . " " would n't do me any good if you did , " bonnie said . " bonnie and meredith , you
[288/1000]	" no . i am not going this time . " beth nodded and offered the empty space where she 'd left her notebook . " i 'll write down my impressions of each , " she said
[289/1000]	" how long ? " i asked . " a week , maybe . " " huh . " he smiled . " i 'll let you know when i have something to tell you . "
[290/1000]	the wind had dropped a little and the ocean was suddenly clear . white sails sparkled among the brown waves as the wind stirred the sea around the ship . they had soon disappeared from sight when john suddenly stopped
[291/1000]	" it 's amazing what people are willing to risk for you . " i gave him a thumbs - up as two couples began to circle each other . " will you be here when we die ?
[292/1000]	then he added , " not like this . " " what feels right ? " " so ... this is what this is about . " " is it ? " chase hesitated and did
[293/1000]	maybe ... maybe these men were after him because of the ... the other ... she could n't have said the name , because she had n't even realized her own name before it drifted like smoke into her mind
[294/1000]	the man grunted . " that 's better , right ? " " that 's right . " the old man held his arms wide . " well , mister , i want you to take me another
[295/1000]	" no more , " he said . " i need to take care of your wounds personally . " " so can i. " i lay my knife across the ground beside me . " i 've tried
[296/1000]	" there we go ! " a man called out . " we are there , gentlemen ! " someone shouted . " look over there in the trees . " a line of people was starting to
[297/1000]	" you get home ... you have five minutes , " the pilot 's voice announced , " and then i have to clear out to the sierra hu ene me , captain . " " roger , the
[298/1000]	if any of the guardians had ever considered using him for this particular job , i probably had , but now ... now the risk was too great . i wanted the guy . " this is just a
[299/1000]	" one , the day that i met you ? the day that made me think back long enough for you to come to me . the day i realized i trusted you enough to find you . "
[300/1000]	i pulled the curtain back to a small window and put the tape on . i pulled it together and pulled inside , closing the door quietly . at the first sign of light , i walked to the
[301/1000]	" what the hell ? " he muttered . he closed his eyes and slowly opened them . " what have i done ? " if i had to guess , it was a man 's first instinct .
[302/1000]	" did you really think i would be happy if you broke up ? " i could n't help but ask . i looked over at reed as we strolled along . " not having him . " i cringed
[303/1000]	" i know you will , " he tells me , holding open the door for me . " she just needs a moment . " i take a deep breath as he leads me past a set of
[304/1000]	" no , but it means they 're not safe . " " why ? " luke asked . " if we have reason to believe these creatures have been attacking the council in the past few days
[305/1000]	" i ... ah ... i've got to do this thing " - he shook his head - " right this second . " " you may have to find a way to win that . " "
[306/1000]	he ran a hand through his hair , ignoring the slight ache in his head . " i 've been thinking more in general than the man 's name . well , not much in particular , since i 've
[307/1000]	it had been weeks since i 'd seen nick . i 'd asked him twice and he 'd come and gone an even dozen times on saturday , twice during the week . by thursday , we could n't get
[308/1000]	her eyelids felt dry and numb in her sockets . she thought her hands and feet would start to burn . but they stayed steady on the warm rubber at her sides . nothing happened . just a little
[309/1000]	" actually they 're quite nice . i met one once , " said jason . " oh ? " asked the old woman . " she was kind enough to take me fishing one day , "
[310/1000]	i was in a quan dary . the rest of the three i would have to manage , or risk making other mistakes . the woman , on the other hand , was very strong and kept me in
[311/1000]	" because of the way i look ? " i asked with a smile . " the first time i saw you dressed like this , i almost jumped his bones . " " no , it was
[312/1000]	' we will get the door off the side , ' said frodo weakly . ' it is closed ! ' said sam , who knew that if there was a latch to be removed there would be .
[313/1000]	" maybe , " she said . " you could be killed , " seth said . " we all could . " " but why do n't we ? i mean , we could n't fight that
[314/1000]	i try to think of a way <EOS> ... not even the time , but these things . the only thing i can think of is how i went into life with my mom , but i 'm pretty simple
[315/1000]	" well , i only asked if you had a girlfriend to let me know about it and i got this huge grin on my face . why ? and how much do i owe you ? " "
[316/1000]	" a few years ago , her father committed suicide . she and a friend returned to town together with the intention to find some friends to help . the friend did n't want to leave his wife and child
[317/1000]	when the sun rose , they came to a city called the temple of the raven . its main street was bustling with activity . there were a number of vendors selling their wares and it appeared that most of
[318/1000]	" yes . " the other girls were gathered around me , but it suddenly felt very far away . they were whispering back and forth , but most were looking at me , and every one but tristan was
[319/1000]	" no , i do n't . i just have n't used that money up yet . " he frowned , and pulled out a pen . " your bank account is well aware of these things . i
[320/1000]	" well , your father is the real loser and your mother the girl who always thought she was perfect ? " she raised an eyebrow at me . " and to think of them being married meant she 'd
[321/1000]	" take her to the police , " victor urged . " why ? i 'm human and you 're human . we ca n't take her to the police because it would only be a false alarm for
[322/1000]	i looked over to my mother to see her with a small , sad smile . her hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail under the bonnet . she held my hand . we were so close that i
[323/1000]	" is there anything else you have to tell me ? i ca n't believe you just kicked me out of my house . " mom 's gaze searched the room , searching for some sign of the bad
[324/1000]	he touched the small of my back in slow , easy movements and kissed me sweetly , passionately and thoroughly , making it almost a kind of heaven . " you always so perfect . and you always said you
[325/1000]	" ' tis no good , there are too many creatures . " it is never too late . i am now as if a light had just been turned on in my heart . i open my arms
[326/1000]	" you wanted to use this ? " that was rather frightening somehow . i mean , i got the impression that a little piece of me had been hoping it would just be me . " uh -
[327/1000]	" look at me when i say that ! " said amy . " you want to think that me being with gustav helped , but it does not help . i love him more than i love jeff .
[328/1000]	in new york city , the day had been full of heat , the stars were bright , the city was dying , the streets overflowing with people looking for work . in tokyo city , the city . in
[329/1000]	" if they feel comfortable doing that , then i think i 'd better hear the questions out loud , " said mike . " yes sir , " answered steve . " i 'll tell them that ,
[330/1000]	what would happen if we could steal a piece of your identity ? i wondered how they would react to a band of marau ding savages , but i thought better of it and instead spoke up . "
[331/1000]	" you better not have given me any trouble , your majesty , " sadeas said to dalinar . " i 'm trying to win over an un representative shard bearer . i 'm not playing with <EOS> at all
[332/1000]	' what about those of you trying to give me a piece of bread ? ' ' you 've got to get a ring like the rest of us . ' ' all right , all right ,
[333/1000]	everyone looked at her with surprise at the statement . she was looking right at sam . " what ? " she said with a straight face . " someone need tell the big brother i can do it
[334/1000]	" actually , ms. parker , i have something for you . do you happen to be paying any attention to the day - time news show on your laptop ? " her eyes widened and the camera panned
[335/1000]	" she looks beautiful , " james breathed , glancing at me quickly then to the girl sitting next to him . " i guess she did . " " you 're looking great , " he smiled
[336/1000]	he frowned . " me , too ? " " yes . " " well , do n't you have to give them the damn journal so they ca n't use it ? " " yes ,
[337/1000]	" oh yes , i remember . thank you , dear . how did it go ? " <EOS> big mistake ; something else hard ... an unexpected win the kitchen ... she 'd even spent the afternoon with
[338/1000]	" oh , i got down here just as you were coming in . glad things worked out for you two kids . " claire 's stomach lurched . as if michael could tell she was upset , he
[339/1000]	" you 're welcome . " he was n't about to give that up by giving her anything . if they were talking about the same stuff , then there was no time for that sort of bull crap
[340/1000]	" you do n't have to go . i 'm sure that 's too hard to take care of . " " no , " she said adamantly . " i want to go . i ca n't explain
[341/1000]	" not in the first place , you may be right . but when it comes to your problems , i would find it very upsetting . and if i 'd had a choice , none of this would have
[342/1000]	' yes indeed . what did you find out ? ' ' nothing really . you can show them all the pictures if you want . ' ' i like photos , but it must be rather private
[343/1000]	" i wanted to know where you were going . do you have a place to go , or do you want to spend the afternoon here ? " " can i call you back ? " "
[344/1000]	" be careful my friend , " the wolf said softly to the beast . it was then that the monster pulled the trigger . the wolf blew the whole village to pieces . chapter 17 " why
[345/1000]	" oh yeah ? why her ? " " because , " he said , his voice dropping . " to hell with the rules ! it 's only fair , because we 've spent months building a business
[346/1000]	" oh damn ! " she said . " do you want the truth ? " he asked . " yes ! " she insisted again . " i 'm guessing you do n't like getting your
[347/1000]	" fuck , " he said . " all right . i guess we need to figure out how best to get right back out there ; at least it 's safe from the explosion . " he paused ,
[348/1000]	" what ? " he said . " why you . " he sighed , his arms sliding around me . i felt like i was melting into him , like i could stay there forever .
[349/1000]	john held her , " do not worry , this will not be long now . " he was exhausted , his body shaking from what he 'd seen of the undead . they were only a few decades old
[350/1000]	" he just came out this morning , he did n't get going until two o'clock , " lily answered quietly . " okay , " nate replied tersely , not giving an inch . " i 'll
[351/1000]	" what do you mean ' yes ' ? what do you mean ? " " ok , not so many of us are here to make a statement about what 's going on in your world . not
[352/1000]	i was wrong when i said it was difficult . it went a little worse for me than if it 'd been someone else . not just because i did n't want to date taylor , but because i told
[353/1000]	" she keeps telling me it 'll figure out , " said the voice . " i know it 's more than a picture like me . " this was a man dressed in purple and green , who wore
[354/1000]	" tell me about it , " he said , as he reached out and pressed a knuckle against my forehead . i closed my eyes as a wave of tears gathered in my eyes . " listen ,
[355/1000]	there must be a god somewhere who has seen this picture , and since they make the world go round one minute , and then suddenly it is gone the next . one little boy loses his head on a
[356/1000]	" i do n't . " max 's smile was thin and he did n't look sorry for me . " i never said anything about that . " the air - conditioning in the car was starting to
[357/1000]	" we 'll take the car , " he said , suddenly businesslike . claire had never heard him act so coolly before . eve picked up her backpack , and eve started walking away . claire ran after
[358/1000]	my heart stopped . i had never imagined so much , never imagined the feeling of being watched or noticed so violently . my body went numb from the intense sensations radiating over me as aiden walked forward , turning
[359/1000]	we spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying one another 's company . i put a couple of movies on , because it had really been a long time since i 'd watched one . we kissed again , then
[360/1000]	" he would have to be , would n't he ? " " yes , " she agreed . " come , do n't go yet . " he remained rooted to his feet , his body slack
[361/1000]	" i 'd just walk up to the altar and make nice , " i said . " how would you propose that be ? " i ignored him . " we can dress at your house ,
[362/1000]	i 'd just lost my best friend . of course i was going to lose her , but i did n't care because it was what i wanted , what i needed . what i craved , with everything i
[363/1000]	" well , since you invited me to dinner , i would like to meet with you about the project . " he was very polite about it . i was confused . " our project ? "
[364/1000]	" it 's the truth , " said miss sp ack man to the top of her head . " look , he came to see us - " " and wanted to see how you were doing ?
[365/1000]	" you 've talked to ian and rachel now ? about getting married ? " " of course i have . that 's what 's important . " " we have n't even discussed your situation with them
[366/1000]	" i do n't know why they keep the vampires here this long . there must be some a way out . " so the vampire who had raised my father was no longer in his prime , and
[367/1000]	my brow furrows as i think about it . he keeps his hand around my neck , holding me close , our knees curled up beneath us . he 's kissing me softly , resting his cheek against me
[368/1000]	" when should i call you back now ? " " as soon as i can get things working on this . i 'm sorry to break up your date . " " are you kidding ? no
[369/1000]	i was hoping he might say " i 'm not like them and i never will be . " " wow , you have a little bit of a screw loose about that , " jack said .
[370/1000]	i laughed . " i do n't need the coffee , so i 'll need a cup . " " uh - oh , " she said as she looked up from her phone . i reached into
[371/1000]	" you have n't seen the ... the rest , " the guy looked panicked . " no , " he said . " i did n't see it the other day . i see all the other kids
[372/1000]	a look of confusion crossed the older man 's face , then the concern disappeared and he replaced the look of concern in his face . she loved seeing it . she knew she had n't seen him like this
[373/1000]	at the bottom of the steps leading back up to her porch , he dropped his hand away . his tone was a bit frosty , but she heard the anger there . " when were you planning to
[374/1000]	" no , it 's not any use . there 's not even an application for teaching . i do n't even know where he got it . or what classes he took . is that really funny ? in
[375/1000]	at that moment a dark - haired man with the lean body , the sharp eyes , and the calm disposition took a seat at the table . he noticed the tray and watched the two faces register surprise .
[376/1000]	" now look here , you two . i wo n't have any more of your shenanigans . this is going to be the last time , you do n't touch my sister or i 'll walk out of here
[377/1000]	" uh , i do n't know , man , it was a rough time , and i 'm not that hard up anymore and it 's nothing like it was when i was sixteen . " " i
[378/1000]	i looked at the sky and the stars with pride . as you can imagine , the stars were getting bigger in my mind as we slowly made our way back across the rolling hills . as i looked
[379/1000]	" maybe we should all stay together , " she suggested . " i 'm not planning on leaving , " john replied confidently . " great , " john offered , " but i am staying .
[380/1000]	her breathing was rapid , but she managed to speak without faltering . ' my father will put me in a new cage at the monastery in ba var ia . ' ' how fortunate . ' '
[381/1000]	" you did what ? " i hissed . all the children moved back to their spot on the floor , not daring to look at me . " you know what , " i said softly .
[382/1000]	" no . and please do n't lie . " " why not ? " " because i ca n't trust you . " " since when can you ? " " since we started .
[383/1000]	" as i said , they were only interested in a girl dating a human . before they knew what it was like to be human , anyway . " she let out a soft sigh . " i hate
[384/1000]	" i 'm fine , " she replied . " do you still have the tapes ? " " yes , " he said . " thank you . " " could i speak to you in private
[385/1000]	he had n't noticed . the image of her face , now , was n't enough . she dropped back to the bed to pull on her boots . <EOS> almost had to hide by the closet , and
[386/1000]	" you can come live with us . " " i ca n't thank you enough . where do you live ? " " in a beautiful mansion in brooklyn . we live in a beautiful mansion on
[387/1000]	her mouth is dry as she takes in the blood seeping from max 's lips along his chin , his clothes , the hole in his chest . he did n't die as he appeared . never . he
[388/1000]	he pressed his lips together , refusing to let the smile threaten . he did n't want to get into a debate about whether or not he did a good job of looking nice , or whether or not his
[389/1000]	" do n't get that , " i pleaded . " are you sure ? " he asked , leaning <EOS> ... like he had been , his arm . " yes , i know you . "
[390/1000]	" when i came to you for help before , you felt so small , so alone . do n't get me wrong , i 'm grateful that you came with me and that you are , but i 've
[391/1000]	" is that your father ? " i asked . she gave me a wan smile and nodded . " the ghost of my father . " " does that mean he 's there in this world too
[392/1000]	" i 've changed my mind . i 'm going to have to think about this and think . " in the next minute , i was pushed down to my knees , my hands on a white towel
[393/1000]	" i have no such concerns , as you 'll clearly see in the reports on board my car . " his brows knitted in confusion . he did seem like a person who was easily affected , and
[394/1000]	" my eyes met yours for just a second . " the words slipped a little out before i could stop them . i let out a breath i did n't realize i was holding . " you 're
[395/1000]	her father asked the guard to turn and let <EOS> and run away . when he 'd returned to the camp with a bucket with his sword , she tried to stay awake for two hours . the guards had
[396/1000]	" it 's all a mistake . " " yes . " " why ca n't we talk about it ? " " because it 's not right . i think we should just take everything we
[397/1000]	" just one . " " and you did n't believe me ? " " i did , " i said . " i did believe you , and i liked watching you . i really did .
[398/1000]	he took it reluctantly . she took a couple of puffs and closed her eyes . " maybe a little . it 's been a long day . " " i 'll be damned . " he sat down
[399/1000]	" that 's right , " i said . " they even fed us their blood when they were running tests . it would have been a lot simpler if the tests were more advanced . but no - they
[400/1000]	" you know what , " i said . my voice sounded scratchy and scratchy , as if my vocal chords never worked . " we 'll be right across the way , waiting for you . " it
[401/1000]	" i do n't do it for it . what if i thought about putting them into the lake and it got stuck maybe ? one thing is for sure , they 'll get stuck , and i 'd never
[402/1000]	' yeah . his hair did n't get out of place . ' ' did he ? ' asked ben . that was about the time he was thinking about their own hair . it had always been easy
[403/1000]	" tell me every other time you do that that i should not become a vampire , " she replied tartly . she was already angry enough about it . " you want me to make you a vampire
[404/1000]	there were several days and nights of travel . his life was a whirlwind of orders and logistics . he rode directly as dawn began to lighten the sky . at midnight , he left his first office in be
[405/1000]	i smiled as i leaned toward her ; i had n't considered that . it would n't leave much room for fighting . i never noticed just how stubborn she could be . " in the year of my
[406/1000]	if you do n't have the right to judge , then take your left hand off my friend here . i 'll think you 're a decent person once you get his address and you can do something about it
[407/1000]	" how are you in so many leagues ? " he asked the raven . " far enough that i may find you , my lord , " the raven replied . he glided gently above the pool and
[408/1000]	the next morning , he stood over ellie 's bed like a zombie in a vampire movie and called to her . " hi , " she said in a sleepy voice that instantly turned into a smile as
[409/1000]	' my mistake , ' i told him , knowing he would think it was a feeble excuse . he was more surprised than i realized . that was good , to be able to keep your head in the
[410/1000]	" you are with child ? " asked the queen , surprised . " i am with child , " replied le of ric , " but i would not know that . " the queen stared at
[411/1000]	<EOS> i did n't know what to say . " and how did you feel when you entered the room and saw the guy i went to see . " i started to deny the truth , but
[412/1000]	chapter 27 i feel it all over now and i know that no matter what happened to my father or to me , i 'm in big trouble . very deep trouble . i try to get to
[413/1000]	" no i do n't believe you , " i retorted . " let me up so we can leave and i 'll tell you the name and the mission specifics . " he held up his hands .
[414/1000]	" you do n't know that . " " he thought he did , " i challenged . " if he thinks he does n't know you , well then he needs to know you have an ulterior
[415/1000]	chapter 6 it was after midnight , and the weather was n't a good one . even standing in the dining room of the estate through the heavy , grey darkness , ellie could feel the tension moving
[416/1000]	he stood up from the desk and stood before me with his arms across his chest . he kept his voice low , but the low , angry rumble was unmistakable . it rolled in a deep baritone that was
[417/1000]	" do you think we could get a good show on monday ? " " i hope so , but you should come out so we can get it going . " " you know i would .
[418/1000]	chapter 10 the night started well . all the troops were in their first stages of preparations for tonight 's mission . they were in order to go undetected and wait in ambush . as planned , the morning
[419/1000]	" you will have to lie down on the floor ; otherwise i have to drag you away from the others on the way over to the entrance . " he looked past her into the darkness . " do
[420/1000]	i take a few deep breaths and try to calm down , but i continue to lean against the window . that was stupid , right ? of course he 's not gay . or even about me .
[421/1000]	" a pretty young lady like you just would n't be found in a village . " " was she pretty ? " she asked . " did you know she was ? " " of course i
[422/1000]	he took his time in answering . he 'd always enjoyed being able to make her squirm . he could n't make her fear him because that would only make him more determined . maybe he should start with getting
[423/1000]	his eyes narrowed . " perhaps i should take them out but i 'm not that desperate . i 'll do my best to look away . " my expression said i thought it might be a waste of
[424/1000]	" what do you think he 's gon na do to me ? the last guy used to do that to me . " he did n't respond , but he did n't have to , because i knew
[425/1000]	" what the hell do you mean ? " " you did n't think he was coming back for a minute , did you ? he 's killed dozens of folks already , people you knew . when he
[426/1000]	' but me too , ' her father said , ' would be better off . she 'd be easier to ... ' ' no ! you do n't understand ... ' ' then what does she want
[427/1000]	all the lights burned off inside . " we do n't know the extent of his mental fortitude . the best we can do is to ask someone else . " i looked at the others , who began
[428/1000]	" there 's not ? " " not here , " she said regretfully . then she started to walk away . oh boy . he really had to get serious with her . or at least she
[429/1000]	" your parents . " " are they here ? " he nods . " which suite ? " he nods again . " i thought they were coming down . " " they
[430/1000]	" um , i do n't know , it 's like , that 's such an important change for a whole family ... " " you 're funny , you know that ? " said aunty audrey .
[431/1000]	maybe that 's why he did n't make it to the cave . maybe his nerves were n't as raw as they should have been . maybe the moment was too perfect . he thought of what he had done
[432/1000]	but i 'm too busy . " she smiled . " i feel the same way . " he paused before his lips found hers . unable to stand another second without kissing her senseless , he nibbled
[433/1000]	that <EOS> that we have good days . " " he was a fool of a man , " she said , " and a wise man . " " the queen of death ? " the
[434/1000]	" the same thing , " he said . " we want this girl first . " " but how ? " " we 'll explain . we 'll meet her at the hotel in half an hour
[435/1000]	" you said you might . " there was something else . " how do you think oliver feels about that ? " she shrugged , keeping her expression neutral . " he hates that he 's brought it
[436/1000]	" this is the most wonderful new building in baltimore . everything from that roof is so grand , yet the entire place almost feels like it 's haunted ! " lilly ann exclaimed with tears of joy in her
[437/1000]	she did <EOS> what he told her . he told her to keep moving . that 's what she did , only at his direction , with a feeling of determination that he would take a picture of this woman
[438/1000]	" do you feel well enough to go tomorrow , sir ? " " yeah , " he said . " will miss you . i 'll look forward to seeing you . " he said he was
[439/1000]	" the story will work , it will work , " he said in amusement . he touched her arm to show his appreciation . she did n't protest . not one bit . " i wo n't let
[440/1000]	" what ? " " i ca n't tell . " " okay , then . what about your father ? is he an alcoholic ? " i ca n't answer that - not only because i
[441/1000]	" you 're right ; it 's not that bad . " " why did n't you tell me ? " she asked . " because you would have beaten me senseless . i 'm no good at
[442/1000]	" i 'm saying i 'm serious about bringing a date here . " " then let 's get married right now if that 's what you want to do . " " we 're not even thinking
[443/1000]	" it 's just me , " he said . " and this little girl . " " yes ? " his eyes bored in on julie as he talked . " the reason you came in
[444/1000]	" it would look better . no one in here would know you were here . " i glance aside to ensure no one is watching and walk around behind the door . the door is unlocked . " i
[445/1000]	he was a man without emotions or even a soul . but he needed to see her and touch her and make sure those feelings were real , that he was no longer an outsider . " i 'm not
[446/1000]	" no . " " maybe this is a bad idea . " " he has a child . she died , and you , and half the world , blame me for it . " "
[447/1000]	" i suppose i should have known something was up , " i say at length . " should i be angry ? " he asks , looking at me through narrowed eyes . " maybe , "
[448/1000]	" thank you , " she murmured without thinking . his arm slid around her waist . " what did you say , sweetness ? " he said into her ear . she pressed her body to his
[449/1000]	" i do n't think - " he began , but then heard a sound coming from the far side of the room . a sudden burst of energy flew into the room . not a burst . if
[450/1000]	" i - " i stammer . i lick my lips . " oh , um ... he 's a mechanic . " she 's been working there on and off since summer summer when she was eight .
[451/1000]	we both realized that everyone was on the dance floor ; a small crowd had already gathered to do the dirty work to ensure our nup tials were held public . not only did he do it , but
[452/1000]	" no , that does it , " he said . " you 'll tell me no secrets my wife does n't already know . not yet . you 're a girl that 's always wanted a man like me
[453/1000]	" oh you 're so predictable , you suck . go out after that and go down on her , make her wild that way , then lay her back , make her come , make her scream . "
[454/1000]	and then i see the answer . there 's another of the most remarkable things on the planet . they 're not on orion 's . " i knew this was coming , " i say . "
[455/1000]	she studied his face , saw his eyes were a dark blue , not so much stormy as intense and she liked that . " i 'll kill you ! " she said with a mixture of threats and
[456/1000]	the man had a short , stocky build , clean cut , dark hair , brown eyes and a friendly , approachable smile . he had a large black suv with tinted windows parked at the bottom of ra h
[457/1000]	the words came from another place , no more than that from some of those in the group . two of the ones still holding the rock did n't even move a muscle . he continued . " i 'd
[458/1000]	" nothing . i just needed something to take my mind off the battle . " " no wonder i have no appetite for it . come , " he said , gesturing to the restaurant entrance . they
[459/1000]	" so , what will you talk to him about ? i will go up to look for you afterward . " " no . i 'll talk to him later . " she was too tired and exhausted
[460/1000]	and so , we found ourselves in the garden , all of us , when we left for the great hall after dinner . we had more questions , but i did not think to ask them about them about
[461/1000]	" you might have known all along about these , " the old man spoke up . " but they 're only out of reach when the weather gets dangerous . here , let me show you . "
[462/1000]	some of the people watching heard us . some stared because i did n't ask questions , but a few came up to help us with our story as we sat down for dinner . everyone , even the
[463/1000]	" are you kidding ? of course i 'm kidding ! " my head shot back and forth between the two of them , " no way , you 're crazy , alex ! " " well ,
[464/1000]	" because they 'd get bored and have something else to do that did n't get done during time and they 'd ask me to go down and help . " " what if you had n't ? "
[465/1000]	she looked at him , taking in his white skin , his lean muscles , his hard nipples and the strong jaw . she leaned in to give him a quick kiss . " i 'll let you love me
[466/1000]	but i would not let them take me . not this time . not again ! when they were like this , when they broke up , i would not let them destroy my relationship with aiden . i
[467/1000]	" this week , that is . " " no way , " i said . " we 're the happiest teenagers at high school right now . she just died in the er . " " i
[468/1000]	" and how did you fare during the journey ? " he asked , surprised that she was making them stay with her even though she knew that the ship would take them to the sea of the winds .
[469/1000]	and i was n't exactly sure what i was going to do right now . he took a step forward and i went with him . it was n't that i wanted to run away . no , i
[470/1000]	' are you all right , dear ? ' the queen asked in a soothing voice . ' you look a bit pale . ' ' just a little nauseous , aunt pol . have you had anything to eat
[471/1000]	* * * they were seated at the small table at the back of the room , looking expectantly at each other . she could barely swallow a sip of tea , and felt as if she were sitting
[472/1000]	" it was the strangest thing it has ever been , " replied janet returning to her desk and closing the drawer . " come in , dean , would you ? janet is not the only deputy in town
[473/1000]	the door to the room opened . " that 's creepy , " danny said . " how come you have so many lights ? " he looked around the room before reaching for his reading glasses . he
[474/1000]	" go ahead , " he urged . " get to work . " she set her beer bottle on the floor and walked to the table with her hands clasped , face downcast . " what if
[475/1000]	" he has a beautiful wife , " rebecca said . " that 's why we should thank you for taking him , or at the very least for bringing him into my life . " " that 's
[476/1000]	" i am . " his gaze slid to mine . " want to join me ? " i had n't expected that . instead , i stared at his mouth , picturing what i could do with that
[477/1000]	" they were so much closer to the house . " " we 're lucky at the beach , " said the boy with the thick irish accent . " yes , i guess we are , "
[478/1000]	" a moment , please . " the sound of doors and a few seconds of silence followed and she could hear a lot of shuffling and shuffling around in the house . she felt bad , she really
[479/1000]	" you did not ask why i am sitting on the edge ? " he says . " because if you ask me , i will tell you . all i need is someone willing to come forward and share
[480/1000]	" it 's fine , i 'll take it from here . just go to the lobby . i 'll try to get the coffee ready <EOS> or something afterward . " she did n't want to tell him yet
[481/1000]	and yet a part of me wanted the same thing . " yeah , well , i do n't like the guys , and i 'd still like to take you back , see if you had really wanted
[482/1000]	" as good as new . we were so worried because he did n't tell us much . i guess if you ever want to get a name like ' tony ' you 'll have to find another name .
[483/1000]	" how did you get up ? " " you fell asleep . i had a dream . " " what were you dreaming about ? " he placed his hand on his chest . " i dreamed
[484/1000]	" does that mean you wo n't tell her ? " i ask him again when he slides into the car . " no , " he snaps , slamming the door and leaning his forehead against the steering
[485/1000]	" thank you . " you can say thank you all you want <EOS> - the way i 'm sick in some time - but nothing is as rewarding as i 've always been . it 's like it
[486/1000]	now , he knew what lay beyond those walls , but until he found those damned key , he 'd take his rest . maybe with a little luck , he 'd find mary jo , too . the two
[487/1000]	" you 'll be spending some time with him then . " " he 's my best friend , " i whisper . " and i 'm you . " they say in unison . " it 's
[488/1000]	i leaned in ; my lips barely touched her ear . " i do n't believe a word he says , eva . you 'll be going to the hospital as soon as the wedding 's over . i 'm
[489/1000]	they stood there in silence for a couple of minutes , each enjoying it . rachel broke first . " i think we should head home ! " chris could n't believe she was so casual about the prospect
[490/1000]	" she 's up , bro . there 's no reason to worry , " adam said , opening the door and gesturing for the woman to get inside . " is she okay ? " i asked ,
[491/1000]	" a little bit , " i admitted , " but that can be changed if we get involved . " " there 's nothing wrong with wanting to help . " she nodded her head toward the dining
[492/1000]	they 're still a couple of kilometres from my house . when i find out it 's a place you barely think about , a place where we 're both alone , i know i had better be careful because
[493/1000]	alex had no idea what that statement meant , but he did n't know how to explain it . did n't want to risk offending zoe by going overboard with his explanation . " i would have told you if
[494/1000]	your father is the reason i had to abandon ya , i found you . you were in love with the man , do n't even get me started . it was always that ,
[495/1000]	' who took his word , my pet ? ' ' he did . they took my word . ' ' you are a sweet infant . why are you so afraid of him ? ' the
[496/1000]	i smiled . " i have a proposal to make , " i said . " sounds interesting . what is it ? " i told him everything , from the attack on rachel del ab ar to
[497/1000]	he paused on the street , trying to control his face . " something has put you on the right path . that girl was just a student , and it probably killed her that she did n't teach her
[498/1000]	and they could not have a baby , because they would have only child blood in their veins , all the other parts of their own bodies . " like the blood brought him to earth . "
[499/1000]	" oh , yeah . well ... " he says picking up the newspaper . " oh , you can check this out . " i smile . i 'm getting a bit used to him being around
[500/1000]	" because he could n't touch them well enough to care otherwise , " i said quickly with a careless shrug . " he needs to know about them to make him feel better . " she 'd tried
[501/1000]	" is something wrong ? " " no . " she shakes her head as the others find it funny that we 're still friends . we do n't do anything but talk , giggle and joke , and
[502/1000]	the car was parked down the road and a bunch of kids appeared on the roof , peering down at the house . on one of the lower floors was a large television mounted on the basement floor . a
[503/1000]	emma was very good at poker , but she had n't been that good at it at the cradle . she did n't really like playing cards ; she 'd been to dozens of poker houses , some of which
[504/1000]	" i had something to tell you , sir . " a man with sandy blond hair held up a slip . wayne took it , thanked the person who 'd followed him and headed to the rest room
[505/1000]	" what about that little thing with her necklace ? " i ask , watching as he puts it on . " she showed it to me yesterday . " there 's something in his voice , something not
[506/1000]	" we have to call ed and jim car ne gie and explain , tom . let me speak to them . " jim got up and walked over to ben , who had a pair of binoculars in
[507/1000]	" yeah , that 's just me . " he shifted on the couch and got up , putting his guitar in its case . " you want to listen to my music ? " emily hesitated . she
[508/1000]	" that was how people at the gas station knew i was a girl when i met you , " i stated as i stepped inside the foyer of the mansion . " remember ? everyone has their little secret
[509/1000]	" we can go and find a place for your sister and her son . " " what were you thinking ? " she demanded . " you never tell me that if a person keeps secrets from you
[510/1000]	" you will not do it . " " i will . i 'll need you to be ready . " " go . " " i 'm sorry , " i said , feeling stupid for
[511/1000]	" what is that ? " " a horse 's blood . the color of blood , " he continued . " are you sure ? " " yes . " " how come they do
[512/1000]	at the moment anyway and i was n't sure why . " i missed you last night ! " my head was spinning . i went to stand , but he grabbed my wrist and pulled me back
[513/1000]	" we do n't understand , " i said hoarsely , needing a break from the pressure the words ' should cause . jared shook his head , looking away from me . " there was nothing we could
[514/1000]	" i do so disagree , " said another woman . she sounded like a woman my age , but her voice matched her build . " if you could consider all that we are doing here for your benefit
[515/1000]	all at once , both she and the wolf became aware that one of them was a man . both gave a small whimper , but the man did n't seem to notice . <EOS> for example . she
[516/1000]	she sat back in her chair and looked at him thoughtfully . it was so easy to guess where she was going with this . " one of the things i had in mind when we talked this morning :
[517/1000]	" what did they think of it ? " " they were really shocked . " " so what do you think ? " " i think even if they did n't like it , they did
[518/1000]	" well , they 're just big girls . we do n't need another guy who goes along with them . " " no , sweetheart . " he 'd known that when he asked this , but he
[519/1000]	my father did not wait for me . he hurried through the doors behind me and headed backstage , his expression one of apprehension . i did not try to stop him . " i 'll meet you back
[520/1000]	but she kept going . " you 're dead ! i 'm dead ! " and then she was gone . it was almost dawn , the last rays of the sun slanting through the narrow window
[521/1000]	they both stood just looking at each other , the moment still being awkward , and then both broke down . it was an emotional moment for claire and david . the words that had been echoing in her mind
[522/1000]	he left the garage , climbing into his car , wishing - hating - that he had n't brought her along ; wishing he 'd taken the time to find something with her in the first place . wishing that
[523/1000]	he shook his head . " i do n't think <EOS> ... or i 'm not sure . i mean , sometimes i think maybe something about you does n't fit . " i said , " well ,
[524/1000]	my throat grows tight as i think about his offer . is it too expensive for me to go to the new york location ? could i ? i 've always wanted to , but something 's pulled me back
[525/1000]	" so what did i say wrong when i said i want you to hold me ? " he whispered against my ear and i found myself smiling against his neck . " i 've missed you , bryn .
[526/1000]	" come on . he 'll have some friends with him . " " oh , okay . i think they 're in the room on the second floor , just out of sight . " i followed
[527/1000]	" can i get you a cup of coffee ? " a woman with short black hair asked , standing next to a large glass - fronted coffee machine . " i need another cup , " i
[528/1000]	" there . " " yes . " she stared straight ahead as her vision blurred with tears . " it 's the price i paid , too . " " what price would that be ? "
[529/1000]	what the hell had had happened to the man ? " she does n't come here often ? " the question was met with silence . " not anymore . " he moved in the direction from
[530/1000]	if anyone saw what he was doing me 'd be into it too , but he was n't holding back . i know you do n't know anything from the world except what you were told . here i
[531/1000]	" well thank you , general , " it said , and dropped into a curt sey . " my name is sir hugo . " " and i 'm master hugo . i was under the impression the
[532/1000]	" yes , dear . i believe you are . please help me and protect him before he changes . " " why do we have to fight to save a vampire ? " " because there is
[533/1000]	" i do n't ! " " do n't you ! " " then the world is a strange place and if you do n't move away , you are in the middle of it . tell not
[534/1000]	i look to one side , and see her friend who has just returned from lunch . " a little hot , huh ? " she winks . " what do you guys say to an extra hot dinner ,
[535/1000]	" tell me , " gray said . " how soon can we get out of here ? " " soon , " vigor said , " if we can get to that building i was trying to ask
[536/1000]	" i need to see him , " said gregor . " well , yeah , why ? so you can talk about that ridiculous prophecy again , " she retorted . " ca n't . we 'll
[537/1000]	when we reached the front desk we were greeted by a tall blond woman with her back to us , reading a magazine . the woman glanced up from her magazine , immediately recognizing us . she recognized us as
[538/1000]	" um ... well , sure ... i was pretty upset back then . " i rolled my eyes . " yeah , well , i was that time . " i pushed off the headboard , heading to
[539/1000]	i smiled , thinking about the whole ordeal . i was thrilled for her , and so was she . " you do n't sound too excited about the news , " dad said . " because it
[540/1000]	" not at all . " i laughed . " i 'm proud of you guys . " " we 're proud of you too . " " you 're leaving now anyway , right devin ? "
[541/1000]	" this is no time for games , " michael said . " go . " the three - man guard had gone , but i knew it was n't long before he gave us the go ahead to
[542/1000]	i was still trying to regain composure , <EOS> little or no , when he told me to look at everything , his words and mine . he took it deep in his throat , pulling off all the crap
[543/1000]	his eyes met hers and her breath caught . " i 'll kiss you good - bye , " vance declared and daisy turned and gave him a wide smile as she threw herself into his arms and he
[544/1000]	" uh huh , " he agreed . the two were silent together . " what was up with her a few days ago ? " he finally asked . " i mean , she worked in the store
[545/1000]	" what do you think ? " he asked . i had to think for a minute before replying . " i think this is ridiculous . not saying i like it . but it 's fun .
[546/1000]	it felt so good to be with someone like garrett . i thought about what this place was going to be like . the warmth of his hand on mine , the stea diness of his voice flowing over me
[547/1000]	" i can get a new one . i 'm going . " " you already got a new one ? " max asked as he turned on the light and looked at my alarm clock . "
[548/1000]	" are you ? " i demanded , ignoring the throbbing headache that pounded in my head and the knot in my throat . he had n't looked afraid ; he simply stared into my eyes , his expression stoic
[549/1000]	one - hundred , they say , " said the king . who did you say it was ? " " the queen cersei , " said tyrion . he drew his sword . " the dor nish man
[550/1000]	he could n't look up at her that way . her dark eyes were too beautiful for him to look away from them . he loved her so much that he was sick to his stomach over what she 'd
[551/1000]	the light above , of course , was broken so by what then seemed like a faint . she lifted her gaze to the dim light , and the image on it was something that she would have found intimidating
[552/1000]	" yeah , " he agrees . " so , you 'll come tonight ? " " yes . " i lean back against my pillows again . " but you ca n't give me free stays . there
[553/1000]	i would love to have been there for him , because there was absolutely no way this was the kind of experience a nineteen - year - old in high school could handle . but i still had my mom
[554/1000]	" and i do n't want to , " i whispered . " i 'm scared . " " tell me you 'll be there . " i swallowed . " i will . " his brow
[555/1000]	" it 's mine , " i agree . jax presses his lips to mine and the kiss goes on for one more second , before his hands cup my face to make a sweet detour to my collarbone
[556/1000]	" we 'll be fine . " she was so wrong ; <EOS> - he pulled her into his arms again , pulling her close against him . " i love you , " she whispered into the
[557/1000]	" i understand , " she said calmly . " i would like to discuss one thing with you if i may . " " anything , " she said , her voice tentative , wary , uncertain
[558/1000]	" well , it made for a nice picture , " said mrs. parker . " something like that . " " it 's quite a picture , just like you said it would , mrs. parker . "
[559/1000]	i have to help . let 's not do any more than where we were before . i 've had six years to get my head back , to think about what was about to happen and why .
[560/1000]	" yeah , i 'll call him . they got ta be here for dinner to get a little light so go ahead . " " okay . " he waited a few more seconds and then hung up
[561/1000]	" they 're here in the room with me . i 'm fine . it 's not just the virus . now ... " " i have you back , jo , " zane said as he came into
[562/1000]	" they must be . " " i do n't want to think about it , i hear . " she nodded . a bit earlier , after they had returned , they had heard a sudden
[563/1000]	" oh for pity 's sake , you do n't know what 's so damned wonderful about living here , do you ? it 's a real miracle . i 've seen so much ... and heard so much
[564/1000]	' what ? oh , right . what did you want to do this time ? ' ' i thought they might like to talk to you . they came in yesterday , of course . ' she opened
[565/1000]	" what are you doing ? " said jack . i kept my eyes on the floor . there were no feet above me , and the whole building seemed to move . i felt myself sink , sliding
[566/1000]	it took them over eight hours to run their exercises . twice after that , they were forced to stop at a roadside lake to rest . they 'd camp or camp out around the lake a few times .
[567/1000]	i smiled back . the idea that he would actually be able to do that , could n't have been better . " okay . " he stepped out onto the deck , and a little breeze swayed the
[568/1000]	" the point my friend was making , " i say quickly , " but it 's too late . we 've been through too much . too much of it , have n't we ? let 's just get
[569/1000]	he 's ready . he 's waiting . " it 's okay , " i say again . i try not to sound afraid . i do n't know why i 'm so nervous . but i am .
[570/1000]	she was holding it out to me , as if asking me to take it . i did . slowly . i laid it back on the floor and let my stare play over the items . there were only
[571/1000]	i felt a hand on my shoulder , and looked over my shoulder , to see denny , hands on his hips , glaring at me . " and would that be a bad thing , are you ,
[572/1000]	" no , i guess i did n't . " he rubbed his face and sniffed . " thank god i did n't get a fever or anything , but i 'm sure i 'd have been too weak to
[573/1000]	the woman 's face relaxed somewhat when she saw me . she seemed at a loss for words and dropped her gaze to the floor . i felt guilty . i felt sorry for her . i
[574/1000]	" i know this does n't look good at the moment but if i can just keep that to myself . " " it better not be something that 's going to make me mad . i mean ,
[575/1000]	" oh stop it , " she said . " you two are not in her situation . you two are never in her situation . it 's just me and you and not ethan . " she threw
[576/1000]	" no , no ! i 'm not ! they 're trying to kill you . the man is n't ... they 're stealing from me . and then they ... they ... they got ta steal from their
[577/1000]	" it 's a really sad story , " he said , getting a weird look on his face like he was seeing something that was n't there . then he cleared his throat and said , " mr. president
[578/1000]	" just stop the car . it 's just a little more than a mile in advance , and it 'll take some getting used to . there was several other vehicles that might have been there there . "
[579/1000]	jake glanced at her , his expression suddenly lost . he cocked one eyebrow at her . " you know i do . " she opened her mouth to say no , but then closed it . "
[580/1000]	i know things in a way . they have been brought to my care . i do hope you are as well . i will have other men do as you ask to serve before i remove you from my
[581/1000]	" so where do you come up with all that stuff about the weather ? " " things happen sometimes , you know . " " oh , right , i forgot that with your living condition .
[582/1000]	" if we go to the office without backup we 'll be down there , and we have to trust in the people - but you know that i like you , too ... " i said , but i
[583/1000]	" we were a step ahead of everyone else , " max said as he kept his arm around her waist . his touch made her a little better . she never wanted this night to end . the
[584/1000]	" you look tired . " his voice was husky , as if he just had n't slept . " i 'm hungry . " she grinned . " but not for food . " " we could
[585/1000]	" no , thank you , " she said with a frown , and then asked , " tell me what you 're thinking . " " about the two of you , " he answered , his voice
[586/1000]	" you 're not kidding , are you ? " " nope , " said dan as he headed out of the bridge to greet red . " when we left the planet and headed back to their base
[587/1000]	" how did you know ? " i asked her , my voice rising as i realized another of their game <EOS> too a thing was a drug in the cellar . my mouth got through the kitchen .
[588/1000]	" tell me about your son ? " he asked . " is he your son ? " she closed her eyes , relieved to have this conversation interrupted . " do n't go there . " "
[589/1000]	james was right . you should never feel guilty over something as petty as breaking one of your brother 's toys , but he did n't seem to understand that . i had to step back into my own
[590/1000]	" i do n't even know . " " that 's fine . " then he took an arm off the door and crossed to the phone on the countertop . i glanced at the door , which
[591/1000]	he smiled , lifting his arms so the sleeves fell around my arms . i shivered at the gesture . " are you cold ? " he asked . " no , " i answered . " thank
[592/1000]	he heard the faint sound of the back door closing and could not remember how he 'd ended up home with his parents . he waited for quite a while , wondering what he should do . if he went
[593/1000]	" ah yes , the story with all the strange characters . " " you 're so full of shit . " " you got that right . " " so what 's with you , mike
[594/1000]	you are becoming more and more important to me . not <EOS> good as they say but good . it does n't take - no , but it is getting you it 's getting me
[595/1000]	i looked over to where the young woman he 'd been talking with came running towards me . the girls were still talking about whatever , i was n't paying too much attention . " i 'm sorry ... are
[596/1000]	well , she had n't lied about that though , had she ? he 'd always assumed her lies had been just that . her skin was like satin beneath his fingers . he kissed that sensitive spot on
[597/1000]	his fingers were shaking , his teeth clenched , making it nearly impossible when the anger he 'd been fighting to keep under wraps began to unravel . rage welled up inside of him , a churning in his gut
[598/1000]	" how did you know ? " he asked , stunned . " i was worried about being overheard . i found out about the woman called jennifer , a woman who owns a catering line . " she
[599/1000]	" that ai n't good , " jim shouted . " oh , well what are you gon na do ? " mark yelled back as brad pushed him up against the wall . " i just pulled
[600/1000]	then i got a full view of him naked in front of everyone except me . he was wearing a skintight , dark gray tank , dark gray jeans and black boots with a thick black belt that would
[601/1000]	" really , so do i. " she shook her head at me , and even i was surprised to see the tears in her eyes . " i mean it when i say it , tristan .
[602/1000]	the man with the small black sunglasses pushed his glasses up his face . " so , " he said , " i guess it is settled . the party is a bust . " he reached into his
[603/1000]	" how long do we have to wait and see what happens ? " asked zachary , still hoping for an answer . " only a couple of hours : we can wait at least another week to prepare
[604/1000]	" yes , i 'll go inside with you . please , make yourself comfortable . i 'll be right outside . " she nodded and walked inside . he stared into the dark , still trying to
[605/1000]	" you two should have stayed together all those years . " anna 's voice was as soft and sweet as i remembered . " you know what ? " i nodded and rested my arms on the table
[606/1000]	" and when we arrive - " " we 're going home . " " i agree . " his eyes were steady and cold . and i realized that what he 'd said was true .
[607/1000]	he waited till she 'd seated herself at one of the booths and then slid into the chair across from her , putting an open file on the table in front of him . " what 's going on ,
[608/1000]	" i was just thinking the same thing . " i smile softly . she winks at me . " shut up . i do n't like you doing that on the phone . " she 's right
[609/1000]	" i can do that , " she said . jason opened the door for me and helped me inside . he gave me his hand and led me up the steps as jason helped me to where our
[610/1000]	the man from the party , however , was much farther along . he was standing in front of his companions and was staring deeply into their faces , seemingly oblivious to anything in the world but his own death
[611/1000]	" no , " he answered . " i prefer the word . . . ? " the word finally broke from him . her eyes filled with tears and she began to sob . " ss shhh
[612/1000]	" yes ! " it was too early to get into it though , so i smiled and said a quick good - bye to max , giving him a soft kick in the knee with my boot before
[613/1000]	" only if you like it . " " yes , " he murmured a moment later , his breathing growing more rushed . " oh , gods , yes . " in that moment , it was
[614/1000]	instead after an hour the team returned to the first floor again looking for a quiet place to talk . " i do n't know what to say rick , " she said standing in the doorway . "
[615/1000]	" i hope you do ... " she whispered . he noticed a blush creeping into her cheeks as her shoulders rose and fell , and he instantly began to look away . " tell me again , "
[616/1000]	" you think with everything you have , you 'll be able to do this ? " peter asked her , not believing to be himself . " i see it , a lot , it 's in my
[617/1000]	" do it . " she grabbed hold of a second one , pulled the trigger , and the first box went off in front of her . she jumped away in shock and fell back inside her chair
[618/1000]	" so what 's your theory ? " " now , it 's all hypothetical . you see , a person loses part of a brain when they die . if you ca n't find your body they go
[619/1000]	" oh well . i think your sister likes me already . " " well then , you 'll have to find a replacement , and you 'll need to hire some help in the kitchen or the garage
[620/1000]	' so you live in a small place so you can live like i would . ' ' yes , well ... ' i frowned . ' my mother thinks i 'm a freak . she did n't look
[621/1000]	" i see , " i said , and i did . because he had . a boy had taken some sort of abuse from his father and his sister and the son was being taken care of . that
[622/1000]	" yes , sir . " she felt her eyes widen when he gave the driver a black bottle of perfume . the driver quickly saluted . the women began to take their coats , and his eyes
[623/1000]	" come on , " i said . " we have n't got all night . " she pouted and walked away . she was trying to work up the nerve to ask her fiancé to call me ,
[624/1000]	it was the hardest thing i did when he was gone : i could n't cry . and it was worse when he was n't . the way i missed him , missed him with every emotion , every
[625/1000]	i took a long sip of tea . the heat felt good . at least it would n't kill me , which was another reason i needed a glass . " so , " she said . i looked
[626/1000]	but did he really ? i stepped back and stepped toward him when he moved toward me , but he did n't touch me . he did it casually , one hand raised and pointing at something over my
[627/1000]	" i am not ! " i yell in denial . he scowls at me , clearly aggravated with my interruption , but i do n't care . " then why do you look so confused ? " his
[628/1000]	" you must make the wish come true , " gabriel whispered , and he spoke to the heavens . " oh man , i wish i had already been a knight ! sorry . " " she
[629/1000]	i took a long hot shower . i got tired of the pounding the water was making and went back to the window to look out . a young man was standing at the curb in his white van ,
[630/1000]	" why are you acting like this is some kind of game in a game to me ? " she asked . her brother gave her a sardonic frown . " i 'm trying to be honest here .
[631/1000]	" okay , they 're trying to make me see things for myself , " rachel said , her voice cracking . her whole body shook . " that 's what scares me . this is who i am
[632/1000]	" yes , of course . " " i 'll leave , " he said , pulling the door open . " what are you doing ? " i asked , watching him close the door and lock
[633/1000]	" i guess . " i shifted as i realized what i had n't answered , " well , yes - i 'm not at all sure . " " if we go back to the house . "
[634/1000]	" well , why do n't we get back to the beach and have a drink with some locals . " " i think i 'll pass , " said the guard as he moved toward the front door
[635/1000]	" no , " the red - haired woman said , " it 's not ! " " so you can go up and get yourself drunk for the rest of the day , " another male voice said
[636/1000]	" well , i should n't even give you a hard time . " " why am i not surprised ? " " yeah , because of this ? you should n't have let him get near her
[637/1000]	" if you say so . " they followed the trail the rest of the way to the front door . the wind hit them like a physical force , making them both shiver <EOS> just below - a wave
[638/1000]	" it must be . " " it 's something in the air , " he says . then he frowns and the expression brightens , before he throws back his head and laughs and hits the steering
[639/1000]	" they 're at the lake and we have to be back in four hours . we 've got to get back up there . our feet hurt and we just got here ! " chapter 8 "
[640/1000]	" you 're staying at the lodge , right ? " he nodded . " if you need help getting ready , you know i do n't mind , " she told him . " no ,
[641/1000]	" that was the end of the story . " " did you have the good sense to have this talk ? " " i think i 'm the one who 's the smart one , since i
[642/1000]	" he 's still bleeding heavily from that punch you gave him , " i explained . she nodded , seeming to make up her mind whether she knew what to do . " i need to call
[643/1000]	" and he probably wo n't come looking for you anytime soon . the others will go to some other place to help their friends , " she added with obvious disappointment . that left him with nothing better to
[644/1000]	" are you okay ? " i took my hand from my face and looked into his green eyes . " i am now , thank you , " i said as i smiled . " you know ,
[645/1000]	" yeah , okay , " she said . " not very romantic , is it ? " " no , " beth said , " it is n't . " the idea sounded cheesy . as if
[646/1000]	" it 's not worth it , " said the guard at the door . " take it anyway . " then he left the room . * * * " thanks for running that stupid truck ,
[647/1000]	as she came up the lane i stopped . he was watching me approach the house and jumped out quickly to greet me . i made myself a sandwich and looked around while he got his sandwich . he came
[648/1000]	" what ? please , do n't think my answer is any of your business . there is a lot going on right now . " " my wife and daughter are in danger . this is going to
[649/1000]	i give him my most innocent smile . " i get that a lot lately . " he scratches at the back of his neck , wincing from the sting . " yeah , i tend to like being
[650/1000]	" do you want me to buy it from you ? " she shook her head . " none of my business . i needed to be sure i - " from the corner of my eye i saw
[651/1000]	" like i tell you , it would be in your do odles . or in the pages of your history books . " " do they get your poetry ? " she blushed . " i suppose
[652/1000]	we got out before they found us . the boy was a tall boy with brown hair that fell below his shoulders . he was wearing jeans and a grey sports shirt . his face was clean shaven and he
[653/1000]	" well , it 's just as well , " said a voice from behind me , startling me . i swung around quickly , blinking in the bright light of the classroom . it was a pretty woman ,
[654/1000]	" well , you do n't have to take me to dinner . that 's fine for you . i went to the movies with matt , you know , " she replied . i stood up and pointed
[655/1000]	he could n't possibly find anything better in her ? after all she was a teenager . and he had n't even kissed her <EOS> ever . " so where 'd you learn to cook this stuff ?
[656/1000]	" that 's right . you ca n't have a meal without food . " he nodded . " actually , i eat a little from the time i 'm born until when they take me home . "
[657/1000]	" have you met her ? " " no . " " let me guess . nobody had this ring on her finger . " " it 's not her thing . " " no .
[658/1000]	on the other hand , she was already moving faster than him . chapter 10 " okay , here 's the deal , " he said . " i 'll give it to you straight . "
[659/1000]	he seemed to decide that she smelled nice and wanted so much more than he could give her . she knew she could still be hurt , but she 'd accepted that she would n't be , because he was
[660/1000]	his heart began to beat faster . if she let him have her , she 'd never be able to say no . and by then he and his brother were more than likely on the same waveleng th .
[661/1000]	they worked in silence , talking about the wedding ceremony and making all kinds of conversation about <EOS> more questions for me . like i , i guess . but it never crossed my mind to wonder what the night
[662/1000]	" well , the fact that he 's a soldier is not the issue , " the lady paused , " this is just about the biggest war i ever saw . i think i am going to have to
[663/1000]	" you can see it , " i said as i looked . " i know i could . " the glow remained constant . the white circle burned against my skin like a white - hot branding iron
[664/1000]	" the people around me find it disturbing , the people around me to the point of no return . ' that 's why you asked the emperor of japan what must be done . ' to add a new
[665/1000]	" ok , we 'll cross that bridge when we get there . " * * * when we arrived at our destination , i did n't notice the car until it stopped . max helped me out
[666/1000]	" let me do all the talking . " adam picked up the remote and turned the volume down . " you have n't left , have you ? " i asked . " what ? it 's
[667/1000]	" at least let me get close to her . " " not with that bitch in the office . " his hand pushed into the pocket of his denim . in another second , he had his phone
[668/1000]	" not yet . is there somewhere you could go ? " and so it was with the first moment for the young girl to feel safe , until she had an answer . she had no need -
[669/1000]	" okay , " i answered , not thinking too much about his statement , because i tried to pretend nothing had changed . but i did n't get it , and the moment was too much , so i
[670/1000]	" you 're good at it , " he said as he stood . she felt a flush of arousal fill her cheeks with heat . " yes , you 're good at being good at it ,
[671/1000]	" do you really think his father is going to make a pass ? " adam asked . " well , that 's the thing , " i started , " i 'm new to this whole thing and
[672/1000]	the moment i opened my eyes , i knew i was dreaming . a man stood over me , scowling and pushing an enormous pillow up to my face . his hands gripped onto me with such force that i
[673/1000]	" okay . " luke crossed his arms and waited . " okay . i 've got what i need . " i smiled and patted both of them lightly . they both looked at me as if i
[674/1000]	" there 's no such thing as gods . you are not dreaming of a god and you will have to face those men if you want to survive . look to what you have to survive . there is
[675/1000]	" what time is it ? " <EOS> , he looked at us once more . " almost thirty now . just before five for you two ! " " i 'll have to run and change my
[676/1000]	" take it , " the stranger muttered . " my father , he had a lot of money in it , " she explained . " no one said he was rich . did he give you
[677/1000]	before the day went to hell , she 'd taken the time to work on a song named beauty in snow . she needed it to start it and be true to herself . " beauty in snow . "
[678/1000]	i walked into the store . i looked at the old desks and chairs with heavy blue covers that covered the floor a few meters away from the door . some of them had white sheets across the bottoms and
[679/1000]	<EOS> she could hear them all over again . i can hear his voice now . ' let 's get off this island , ' i told him ... the words sound like gibberish to me now , at least
[680/1000]	" you are aware of why i am here , are n't you ? " " yes , " the woman said , watching the river stream that rushed past and the sea of young adults pushing and running
[681/1000]	" no , " i said . " yes , " she said . and i asked , " there has n't been a time when we were n't on opposite sides of any issue , kate . it
[682/1000]	" yes , sir , " chris agreed . " i remember i did n't have anything to wear . " " well , you can figure out what to wear when you get back . i 'll text
[683/1000]	" they were actually there for her , " he said . " the doctors thought i was the one that was suffering . " " but how did you know ? " he asked rhetor ically . "
[684/1000]	" i will keep you safe . " william said softly then released the rope and gave her one last brush and quick glance . simone did not look in thomas 's direction , but that 's exactly what
[685/1000]	" he knows and he will just laugh at them , " she said to me . " do you love him ? " " yes , " she said , and she did n't sound like she
[686/1000]	the doors opened into a very dim , shadowy , and very dark interior . this room 's only light came from the single light of a single bedside lamp . it was large enough to make out a long
[687/1000]	she started the motor . the car shot forward as she checked the mirror . she watched as they pulled out almost double - time , speeding rapidly for the exit when frank suddenly turned his head and looked directly
[688/1000]	" do not worry , we come equipped to battle you my lady . " " not anymore " she said , her eyes cutting on his face , then widening in a flash and anger . " this
[689/1000]	" there 's nothing she can do to help , " he shouted . " go back to your hotel . you can wait until morning . " he heard the doors close . he could see someone moving
[690/1000]	" ' sc use me . " frank spoke softly , keeping his arm around anna . " i 'll be quick . i 'm just going to swing by the coffee shop to get you something . it would
[691/1000]	the door to her room had been open ; it was n't quite midnight yet . she was almost tempted to follow the aroma of coffee up to her room and take a bath . but in case her mother
[692/1000]	the voice came from outside , where three people were lying on the floor of the dining room . each covered and gagged . there were three girls ' handcuffs . a man was walking briskly along the sidewalk with
[693/1000]	but you did n't know that before . " he reached out and touched her cheek , his touch causing goose bumps to rise as he bent his head and brushed his lips against hers , his tongue stroking her
[694/1000]	" here . " he reached in his pocket and pulled out a red plastic container . the container was square in shape and had a yellow label in the shape of a heart inscribed the words " x l
[695/1000]	her eyes went to noah . he looked as miserable as she felt . her heart twisted . she pushed her chair back and got to her feet . one of the other orderlies was already moving toward his patient
[696/1000]	" do n't you find that really hard to believe ? " " i would n't be surprised . " i sighed . " fine . i did n't come here to talk about this . all i
[697/1000]	no . <EOS> . . none . " silence . " what ... are n't you going to give me ? " he considered that . he was so damned uncomfortable right now it was beginning to
[698/1000]	" well , i hope not , " jack said . " so , jack , you know just from the way you were looking at her face ... is everything going okay ? " shelly asked .
[699/1000]	" you ca n't keep doing this ! " " doing what , hon ? " " you ca n't keep doing this . i ca n't take it any longer . " she screamed and ran
[700/1000]	it may have been a part of the war , but only in the sense that of a more powerful race , an extremely dangerous and deadly one at that . once in the clearing , i looked down
[701/1000]	in the middle of some sort of argument with the man , the man she had fallen for asked her with surprise , " you 're not going to talk to the king now ? " victoria was dumbfounded
[702/1000]	a few days after i heard about mia in her office , i received a call from stan . i knew immediately who it was even before i answered the phone . " hello , stan . " i
[703/1000]	" you have n't looked away since we started , " he murmured , drawing her hands from her waist for a moment , then he slipped his hands under her skirt and up around her waist . " you
[704/1000]	it took a moment before she responded . " my father is a healer , not a fighter . besides , i 'm stronger . it 's a given i can pick up something useful if i have to .
[705/1000]	" not now , " he snaps and looks back out the window , watching her walk away , trying to clear his head . " i 'll call you later . " " your cell number ? "
[706/1000]	" who the hell are you ? " i looked into his eyes and had a good idea . " marcus , this is della who my ex - fiance marcus sent to kill me . she 's
[707/1000]	" not likely . " he raised an eyebrow and held her stare . " trust me , you 'll love that . " " oh , i already do , " she drawled back . " " as
[708/1000]	the other three looked to the men , who stood speechless . " we 'll keep it simple . do n't expect him to believe you . " they nodded in agreement . " this is a
[709/1000]	" that 's your father ? " i asked . " yeah , i ca n't believe it 's him . of course it 's my dad . " " let 's check it out . "
[710/1000]	i am almost too exhausted to look at him again , for fear i 'll fall again and it 's a very good thing he 's still kissing me . the next morning has passed quickly . she
[711/1000]	" no , " she answered softly . " yeah , " he promised , not needing words to do it . it was a true , honest and truthful truth but also a lie anyway and it was
[712/1000]	i 'd been talking about her to no one in particular , and only for a few seconds . two steps forward , and a man appeared before us . dark hair pulled back into a tight knot .
[713/1000]	the doctor nodded . " yes , i do . my arm is broken , but i can see it in the light . my heart and lungs are still working <EOS> before i left , and the blood rate
[714/1000]	" i shall be happy to try anything , miss blackwell . " as soon as the door closed behind him , sarah drew her jacket tight , looking around the room as if seeking a way out of
[715/1000]	he did , it almost made him laugh . like someone whose brain was fried off was supposed to laugh . " well , if i get one thing out of it , it 's that you do n't
[716/1000]	" yes , they are . " with great effort he forced himself to say the words , " but the man who holds the key to the key to the great escape from death is no longer , as
[717/1000]	" i prefer that term to the ' i thought you 'd like the term ' . " i shake my head , struggling with an imaginary train of thought trying to figure out whether or not to laugh
[718/1000]	when he spoke , it was as if the darkness was taking his words down to him . " i 'm afraid i ca n't help you , rose . " * * * " what do you
[719/1000]	the line went dead . not as good as a telem ar ke ter , but better than a cop . they 'd found him . chapter 31 the men 's room at the high -
[720/1000]	i leaned back and looked at her . " you are a freaking genius . " the smile she gave me was contagious . " well , i 'm the genius here , are n't i ? since you
[721/1000]	a small smile touched cassie 's lips . he was cute when he was flustered but when he was angry , she would be a lot harder to read . " as a matter of fact , yeah ,
[722/1000]	" no , not really , " i said . " not unless people look their whole lives , in other words . " " but i do n't ? " she glanced sideways at me , as though
[723/1000]	" be warned . there 's a couple of things you should know . " with that , she stepped out the door . " where is she going ? " joe said the minute he heard the car
[724/1000]	" yes , sir , " he said . " is he awake ? " he wondered aloud . was he dead ? " good , " said ezio , and entered the room . " what a
[725/1000]	" come on , let 's get the damn horses out of the barn . " " i wanted to ask you if you wanted to come with me , " will said . she turned . "
[726/1000]	he frowned as a cool wind brushed across him again , and he stood up . he knew he 'd done something wrong , but it was so very simple , and he just could n't bring himself to move
[727/1000]	he does n't say anything else , just takes her hand and draws her close , leading her over to the fire again . and again . and again . their faces come up to within inches , and she
[728/1000]	" and you 're leaving ? " the queen raised her gaze . " no ! i did n't come here to go anywhere . how could i leave when the ones who gave me refuge were gone ?
[729/1000]	her eyes went big , " um , okay . " i turned the top of the washer on and started the machine . then i turned to her . " she 's okay , she 's in
[730/1000]	" okay , i have to go . later . " " okay . later . " i end the call , hang up quickly , and then dig in my purse for my phone . it 's
[731/1000]	" all right , " he said , " here it comes . in my dreams , i swear i hear you going on with the war on . " " not really , " michael said .
[732/1000]	" the city of cairo is in the heart of his native country . " " there can be no denying the significance of his vision . it is clearly the key to the answer to his task .
[733/1000]	" you look lovely , " he said , kissing me . " thank you , " i whispered . he 'd been waiting for this kiss , anticipating it , wanting it from the very start . i
[734/1000]	" i 'm sorry , you might have to wait for an ambulance . " " no , this is going to wait . " " alright , well . i have to go back for a minute
[735/1000]	that 's probably it , was the only response i could muster . maybe he did n't just leave me ? what if his reason was n't that he wanted to marry me before we 'd left here ?
[736/1000]	" let 's go , " said luxa . " take my hand . " for a moment gregor was too stunned to move , then his fingers laced through hers . " where are the fireflies ? "
[737/1000]	" and ... " " and the kid ? " " we 've had multiple sightings in the past few days . the kid comes every two weeks or so . " " and when are you
[738/1000]	" in fact ? " he shrugged , a hard edge to his voice that made her think he did n't have to explain . " i do n't know , but there was a time i wanted to
[739/1000]	" yeah you did because you 're a strong old school feminist who has a backbone of steel . " ben had n't taken his eyes off the road for even a minute . it was all ben could
[740/1000]	then he looked at me seriously and asked , " you think you 're gon na get the last word , finnie ? " i stared into his glittering eyes and whispered , " yes , frey . "
[741/1000]	" why are ye so upset ? " she murmured . i stared at the bottle in my hands for a long moment , and then set it down beside me , shaking my head . " how
[742/1000]	" no , you 're right . i should n't have told you a thing . just because you read the paper this morning , and had it spread in front of your door . " she pulled in
[743/1000]	" we have a problem , sir . " my pulse jumped and the room spun . the other elves stood up and got ready to storm away , ready for what was going to be bad . that
[744/1000]	" you want to know if i 'm dating somebody ? " she let me talk , but she never pulled away . i stood up . " fine . i promise not to tell on you .
[745/1000]	' well , come on people . ' said mccready , trying to shoo them away . some of them protested but mccready ignored their complaints , picking up the black book he had been reading earlier and holding
[746/1000]	we waited for her reply . ' no , that 's not his true father , ' she replied . ' you must recognise how far his powers extend . ' she looked closely at him , and
[747/1000]	you were about to argue with me when you saw my old man . " " i do n't know what you 're - " " ah yes . an answer to a qu elling question . that
[748/1000]	" yeah , " he said . " she 's like the wind . " " do n't use her real name . do n't give in to her . she would n't like that . " "
[749/1000]	" good . " i smiled back and he pulled away to give me one last hug . he gave me a small kiss on the mouth before letting me go . " i 'll see you soon . call
[750/1000]	they set out in silence . " you need to sleep , darling , " drake whispered , as he ran a hand through her hair . " i 'll wake you when it 's over so that you
[751/1000]	" you were there the night they killed me . " " who ? " " the one in the dream . the man who just disappeared . he was here the day i saw you and sam
[752/1000]	i 've got to work to get ready for my walk . " i 've been working to get your apartment fixed , so get a hold of the insurance company . i 'm going in as soon as
[753/1000]	" if anyone is up there , say something . " " what ? " i was afraid i knew what he was n't saying , but i was also too nervous to speak . " say something
[754/1000]	" get in , " he ordered . " sorry , " i mumbled and got in the passenger side of the car . jake got in after me . he started the ignition . it ran on
[755/1000]	" you will get no more . i will have my lawyers contact you immediately . " i nodded . i would n't help them if they asked me to . " i thought i saw you in the
[756/1000]	our group had settled a few more feet from them , facing tristan . he stood by me , arms crossed over his broad chest . " are you saying that i 'm my father 's daughter ? "
[757/1000]	" if it makes you feel any better , i 'm here , " mom said . " whether ... " " or she ca n't make it , " shane added . " she 's at the other
[758/1000]	" i 'm done . " rachel held the cell phone out to him , ready to ring her dad , as she 'd done countless times over the years . " this is rachel . " "
[759/1000]	" i should n't have expected it . i do n't know what i would think if i 'd known . my brother is n't like that . " my stomach fluttered with my thoughts . what if he
[760/1000]	" you 're not a cop . " he stared at her , wondering if she thought she was just a victim . not one to use his position to her advantage . she pushed away from him .
[761/1000]	" yeah . i do n't go to the library very often . i 'm not sure yet . i never really thought much about it in my life . i got sort of lonely and i just wanted to
[762/1000]	the next day , when a gust of wind knocked the sun 's rays down - a chilly february night in maine - thomas opened the car door , climbed out , and began to walk . it was possible
[763/1000]	she turned to a group of teenagers who 'd gathered around her , and glanced back at him . " i 'll be here , too , " she told them . it was a small group , but
[764/1000]	' the boy never loved you , ' said granny reproach fully . ' he did n't want to come with me . he 's too young , too blind for me . but they tell me that his father
[765/1000]	how was i even supposed to know ? my past came and went , but i never cared about who i was . the next morning , i got up to go , but when i got downstairs i
[766/1000]	she said , " can i see your wallet ? " of course . she opened it . " i 'm so sorry - " i laughed . " sorry , sorry , sorry , it 's all
[767/1000]	" i can see your point . i do appreciate it , " said the man . " there must be something we can do . " " we 've already tried ; the general has found a
[768/1000]	another voice shouted , " we got him now ! " as the dark creatures lunged at him , eric yelled , " we got him ! " chapter twenty one the next morning , eric stumbled
[769/1000]	even from afar , his name pierced kate 's heart . " of course not . how could you know ? " " because you are stubborn . and proud of it . and at the same time ,
[770/1000]	he looks at her , but his eyes glaze over . " and you 're not married . " her face twists at this point in the proceedings . " no . i mean , i am . "
[771/1000]	the idea of being with him , even for a moment , was bittersweet . why could she not have a normal life , a family , who simply liked having her around so much that she 'd become complacent
[772/1000]	he 'd been sure that one of the guys was working during the day , but now ... now he actually was n't sure . " tell me .... " his voice was heavy with emotion . "
[773/1000]	but he was too weak to stand on his own . i wrapped my arms around him and kissed him again , as if it could be done and he could be safe . it was the only thing i
[774/1000]	a black bmw had just pulled up on the opposite side of the street and just down from the hotel . and then that 's when i knew . i knew the next few seconds would be my ruin
[775/1000]	" nothing at all , not really . " i shrugged , watching them both frown in confusion . " his father was human . i guess my guess is you . " " i had no idea ...
[776/1000]	he looked back at the guy and said , " fuck off , the rest of you . " the guy stared at sanders for about a full minute , as if the man were trying to understand him
[777/1000]	" so which one of you is going to be the first to tell us our mission ? " said the first secretary . " the first is a short story from a book i discovered when i was
[778/1000]	" why ? you see nothing wrong with a man and a woman sharing ? " " it 's not that . one of us , or both , needs to be aware of what 's going on ,
[779/1000]	" do you know where she lives ? " " let 's go ask my doctor when we get home today , " his grandfather answered , picking his way out of the room and across the hall .
[780/1000]	" what the hell is wrong with you ? " she said , throwing her hands up . " no , you do n't have to go to new york . you 're not thinking straight . they 're our
[781/1000]	" what are you doing ? " my dad asked . i looked up . " i have to get her food , " said rory . " i 'll do it , " i said as i
[782/1000]	" we both know i 'll never be happy again , " she said quietly . " i promise to look after you . " " i 'm not at all worried about that , " i assured her
[783/1000]	his lips turned up , the smile a little strained . " i did it . i <EOS> ... went to sleep . " " you did . " " i mean , about me leaving . "
[784/1000]	and though i loved that child . i thought perhaps her face was familiar , maybe . i never told her , of course . it would have been different had she answered me . but , yes .
[785/1000]	" how ? where ? what happened ? he was just there , i mean ... he did n't seem to hurt you . " " he did not attack me , but his hand ... it 's on
[786/1000]	" your best friend from the other night ? " she asked . " that you mean ? sure . we were n't serious . " " are you kidding ? " she grinned at me like a
[787/1000]	as the air , with its chill air , returned and then retreated , she made for the side entrance . though the place was dark , she could at least see inside . she did n't get far ,
[788/1000]	" she said i should stay away . said any bad thoughts she might have had were well founded . " " is she all right ? " " she will be . they gave her medicine for
[789/1000]	he nodded and dropped a kiss on the top of her head . " i love you , too , baby . i 'm going to get you out of this town as well as us . wherever it is
[790/1000]	" yes , i see that . " " you know , i have a funny question for you , " i said . " okay . " " when you left your room one day ,
[791/1000]	" what do you have there ? " she did n't know but had to say , " a picture . he said he 's one of the most stunning men in the world . he 's perfect .
[792/1000]	her face is tight with rage that has no capacity to comprehend , and she shakes her head , even though kevin has also made the comment . the thought of being tied up , gagged , drugged like an
[793/1000]	" he 's here to take me home . we have a plan , " said a weary voice from behind <EOS> - if about one of the world - then an old favourite . " how 's i
[794/1000]	she nodded . whatever he had made was n't good . " i 'm still scared . " " you will be for quite a while . more than enough to get us <EOS> ' t ard out of
[795/1000]	this was all too much . <EOS> this was her father 's absence . he was n't even much of anything . " i have no idea about the last year as far as i know . " i
[796/1000]	he turned swiftly and grabbed her by the arm . " are n't you going to get warm with that coffee ? " " leave her alone , " i heard myself say . i glanced up at
[797/1000]	" are n't you going to go to an office ? " " let 's go into this office . " mary kate walked into norman norman 's and said , " norman , this is mary kate
[798/1000]	she was wearing a pink flowered sundress , with her hair blown out to the front and her skin glowing . he shook the lingering thoughts off . in no time at all he 'd be running up and
[799/1000]	" and ? " " do i need to get them to get back up on their feet ? " he asked . " no , " she said . " just tell them you 're tired and
[800/1000]	" no . " " why not ? " she asked . " why ? " " because i 'm going to lose everything if i do n't have the antidote . everything , " he said ,
[801/1000]	" i think it 's a good idea , " said neville . " keep an eye out for a wolf . i might not have been able to get enough wood for the cottage by the time you returned
[802/1000]	" fine , " i say , but it comes out as grudging . " if you 're ready to talk . " he nods . " since you 're wearing headphones , i 'm guessing you 're
[803/1000]	" this is n't a joke , " she said stubbornly . " i 'm not messing around and you 'd better go . now ! " " no . " " no ! " she said again
[804/1000]	he took a step forward and stopped , looking around in confusion . so would his mother . her face filled with panic . " you do n't have to do this , richard . " she put her
[805/1000]	he swallowed so hard his throat felt like a lead mask . he took the glass and picked up the one that had been left on the bench . " you were n't just helping , " he said
[806/1000]	" i guess you know what she 's going to call it , " said simon , looking grim . " well we 'll leave you out of it , " said the red - haired girl . "
[807/1000]	they watched the parade of soldiers while the air force commander escorted the civilians out of the building . the soldiers were not allowed near the area that they were going to and the soldiers quickly got past them .
[808/1000]	" and ? " " and i just hope that all of them did n't . " he shrugged and smiled thinly . we were standing at the entrance of a large stone building , a square tower
[809/1000]	" at least we may save some time , " he said , " while i continue to be distracted by your charms . i do not think it would be a wise thing to attempt a hunt . are
[810/1000]	" i do n't think a lot of things about them , but with you the way you are , i think ... i think a lot of times they are n't what they seem . " " what
[811/1000]	" yes . " he nodded , feeling a smile tugging at his mouth . " i was wondering why the hell you did n't bring it , i saw someone at the store yesterday who saw you at the
[812/1000]	" well , i do n't . " " have you - ? " his mouth was on her breast . now that was the way to start the evening . a little slow . a little tender
[813/1000]	she glared at him . " that sounds quite promising . " she cocked her head . " what ? " " that look . " he pointed . " you know that one about the deep blue eyes
[814/1000]	" for a half an hour , yeah , " she sighed . " i 'm just glad it 's a little longer . " i walked around the plane until i was able to see her out the
[815/1000]	" you 're going straight to them , are n't you ? " i demand . i 'm going to have to come up with something fast , as the last thing i want to be doing is giving logan
[816/1000]	" no , not really . just <EOS> really not hungry . " i 'm curious about the dream . i ask you what color did you see . do anything . she 's always been my favorite
[817/1000]	the end eotdelim chapter one " what are you doing here ? " i turn my head to see my parents walking toward me in a heated discussion . i 'm not sure what they 're arguing about
[818/1000]	and there was the inevitable death penalty . there was the inevitable death penalty . and there was the future i could n't see . i had no idea where the future was . what i knew i
[819/1000]	he wanted a drink of wine , but he was still the same drunk , and then he would be the one giving it away . " you know - we 're going to need a bodyguard , "
[820/1000]	" what do i have to do ? " he asked , his voice hushed . " you ca n't fight demons , " i whispered . the demon in me stirred . it hated demons . that
[821/1000]	the room was crowded . i sat down on the edge of the bed , feeling the cool sheets soak into every inch of my skin . " i do n't like being in here . " " no
[822/1000]	" okay , i take it from your stance that you 're going to want to make the first move . or am i missing something here ? because if i was missing something big like my eye opening ,
[823/1000]	" when i was a kid i 'd pick my dad 's tennis balls , and he used to say how much he loved it ! he would say , ' did you know that a tennis ball is the
[824/1000]	" you want to talk about <EOS> she went to get killed you found someone named , i guess so you had to bring the whole time you did n't sleep , " she 'll have something to eat ,
[825/1000]	" when we 're on a plane , we are , " he reminded her . so , there it was . she 'd had a dream about him that had changed everything . " so we might return
[826/1000]	" we 've stopped by the office of the director yet . can you tell us about it ? " " we have to get our names printed and they wrote it down . " " thanks .
[827/1000]	that would take a lot more of a boost than him running over and kicking something , and he 'd have to replace it now . but i 'm actually a big guy , a giant hulk , an absolute
[828/1000]	" i mean , you have to imagine a whole universe full of gorgeous girls . " i glance at sam , surprised the most . but he 's smiling . " yeah , well , i guess
[829/1000]	" the problem is it has to do with me not being able to take care of you , but it does n't mean i ca n't do it . " the waiter returned . there was an extended
[830/1000]	" we 're in vegas . " she leaned back . " vegas ? why ? " " look . " they both leaned forward , smiling . " let 's hear about this house ,
[831/1000]	" so ? " " so , our families tried to get away , " i explained . " but she had other plans . " " how lovely , " she complimented . " does n't everyone
[832/1000]	" there are no clues of her whereabouts or whereabouts the girl was living , " he said . " none at all ? " said jack when cranston explained why . " nothing , " i added
[833/1000]	" a month wo n't last forever , " she replied . " you ca n't forget it . " " you 've already forgotten it . i 'm still going , emma . i just have to be
[834/1000]	" very few of us would venture beyond that point , " denth said , glancing back toward the sea . " we were created to kill . it 's never something that comes along naturally . " "
[835/1000]	he dropped her hands , clasped her wrists in his large hands and said , " there are no rules , hannah , not without your permission . " she sat back on the couch , crossed her arms
[836/1000]	i smiled slightly . " i 'm sure <EOS> ... " i turned towards the bar . " would that be okay ? something , anything ? " he looked at me like i just asked him a joke
[837/1000]	she glanced to her sister , who was looking at her curiously . " what ? " " you know what . look . " she held the laptop to rae 's eyes . " this is how they
[838/1000]	" no , you wo n't know him ! " i reply , " but then what ? " " how do you know that ? " he asks , puzzled . " yes , and how was
[839/1000]	a feeling of calm flooded through her eyes as she studied his tall stature . though she could not be certain he was not a vampire , she recognized the strength in the muscles and the power emanating from
[840/1000]	" well , we 're gon na be here all day , but we 'll be quick enough . we 've got a bus to get to and a few days of camping , " kelly said . "
[841/1000]	" what about her death ? is he going to let me go ? " it was a stupid question because he had no idea if he would let him go . she shook her head vehemently . "
[842/1000]	" yes sir , " i said to him . i was not alone . i saw him as i approached , sitting slightly <EOS> as a waiter . a dark - skinned person with a sort of regal
[843/1000]	" no , i guess not . i told my father i 'd have to get up early next morning , early as you like . i meant it when i said i would n't tell him if i did
[844/1000]	" okay , that 's enough , " she said . " you know we can help . it would help if you 'd at least give us some more details . we can help . " " you
[845/1000]	" you 're not going to work here , " i said quietly . " all the stuff from your home is here . in your box , the one you put here . " i pointed to my broken
[846/1000]	" i do n't mean to be rude , but i am very sick and tired of being treated like a child . " i looked at michael with a sad expression . his brown eyes were sincere , they
[847/1000]	he looked at her intently . " how do you know , honey ? " she took another gulp . " it 's not about knowing , travis . it 's about survival . if i lose you ,
[848/1000]	" no , in the course of my career , " the woman said coolly , " you have made a mistake . so therefore , no more of this . you may ask . " " not as
[849/1000]	although i thought i 'd be disappointed by not seeing him again , i was n't . it was hard to remember the last time i 'd seen him and knew i 'd never see him again . "
[850/1000]	" yeah . i could n't stop thinking about the way you looked last night when i had your dress on . and the way he 's looking at you . i ca n't fight the feeling that everything is
[851/1000]	" i 'm an old friend of the chief 's , " she admitted . " i did n't know where he 'd gone , but i was told that he said to let him know what happened . "
[852/1000]	" i 've asked myself the same thing . i never really thought things through , but how is that different from that ? " <EOS> - maybe running her own doubts , though just for a while had
[853/1000]	" there 's some stuff i need to do , " ethan says . " i promised alex i 'd go get him a coat . he would n't let me leave the house late . " he moves his
[854/1000]	i did not answer at the time , afraid his attitude was a negative , as i really was not in anything to be negative about . but later i was curious . i imagined a " new man "
[855/1000]	" i tried . " i whisper , looking down and grabbing my bra as i stand up . " have you changed your mind yet ? " i shake my head no and pull the curtain shut
[856/1000]	the world was a haze of confusion and panic . and the woman in the center of it all . as she reached for him , the power ebbed and the dark crystal in his grip dimmed a
[857/1000]	" are you saying i 'm one of the first ? " " no ! but do n't let this go to your head . you 'd better not be in love with him . " " i
[858/1000]	and then he touched her . he placed a finger on her lips to silence her . his hand trembled . he stared down at her , still confused . he was not upset when she walked into
[859/1000]	" this is your final request ? " it was all she could say after a long pause . " i do n't even know why i 'm asking . i just know you asked this . " but
[860/1000]	there has to be a way . not just the way you 're leaving , but how you make yourself make it . " " thanks to the whole deal you 're offering me for my ... project ,
[861/1000]	" just when i think i 've got the rest of my life to prove to myself and my family why , " the young woman said . " yeah , " said peter . " i hope i
[862/1000]	he reached for his clothes and looked around , but what he saw surprised us beyond description . " maybe you should put the gun down so i can watch some p * * n ? " i took
[863/1000]	" how does she feel about your sister being there ? " " she wo n't care that it 's the wrong one . they call her ' crazy ' . i need her around , <EOS> ... <EOS>
[864/1000]	i 'll see you guys tomorrow ? bye . we had to get to the hospital or she 'd know or they 'd put me on a iv fast . we were n't going to get to
[865/1000]	" they were trying to catch me . you know , catch me . " " you did n't tell them anything until tomorrow , " he insisted . " no matter how much you wanted to . <EOS>
[866/1000]	on the couch , ethan stared at the two women , his hands gripping the legs of the chair . ' now what do you think happened ? ' ' that i 'm on to them ? ' asked
[867/1000]	" she 's a bit odd . a bit strange . and she uses herself as a weapon against people who hurt her when they 're not around . " that woke up the old man . " she
[868/1000]	" what ? did i miss an episode of the apocalypse ? " " it was n't really a game . i mean technically it was . we said we would meet in the same place , if so
[869/1000]	" i know . your father told us about it . at first she would never let me see anything besides his pictures . until they told me who she was and why , it always made me feel sad
[870/1000]	i nodded , a little annoyed that she assumed my best friend was anything like me . " and they always do shit like that , " he continued . " hey ! " i said , waving
[871/1000]	" i am not entirely convinced of that . " " they are both pretty young . they should be well equipped . we just keep all sorts of food down here . the water will not do any
[872/1000]	" yeah , but it 's only until the middle of the storm , " he replies . " people have enough to live on at the moment without it worrying them . " i think about what he
[873/1000]	oh , yes , it was a very good time to spend the evening with a beautiful woman , he thought happily . was he already horny all over again ? probably . a woman does n't come to a
[874/1000]	" i would n't call you a thief , " she said . " i certainly hope not . " " that 's not what i meant . you 're not dangerous . " " i do
[875/1000]	" here , " she said . " one day soon we will see if i am better off . " we sat on the very edge of the boat and she placed a brush against her hair , smoothing
[876/1000]	and a big one . maybe i should have pulled myself out of bed sooner . i should have called her before i rode away , not after . you never know . the sound of <EOS> not
[877/1000]	we were two young gentlemen in the kitchen . as i set the drink in front of her it fell over onto her lap . she caught it and threw it back in one smooth movement . " that
[878/1000]	the old man sighed heavily , like a man that had not slept for too long . he felt no immediate emotion or desire to assist his son - in - law , so he was left waiting ,
[879/1000]	" who 's in town ? " " people who came here once to see if you were still alive . your dad . " she turned off the engine and they both climbed out . "
[880/1000]	" sorry - that came out wrong , did n't it ? " he laughed . " i 'm just sorry i do n't say anything more about what must be the heart of this mystery . "
[881/1000]	she nodded . " it does n't matter because what 's done is done . you ca n't change those who are out to hurt each other . " they were all silent for a moment as they simply
[882/1000]	" it 's a big city , a year and a half of small towns , " richard looked out towards the ocean ; the long low walls around the town reminded him of those stories he used to tell
[883/1000]	i held out my hand . " i do n't think so . " " you do n't know that . " his voice was serious . with an apologetic smile , he started off , then stopped .
[884/1000]	his voice cracked . " i have never been more in love . i would be lying if i said this did n't feel good , but it does . i love you . so f * * king much
[885/1000]	he turned again . ' we have to stay where we are for the moment - we do n't want some thief deciding to come and take these pictures . there 's no telling what they are , and we
[886/1000]	" i 'm still not quite sure . " " what are you talking about ? " the words seemed hard for him to choke out the words - as though they needed no further prodding . "
[887/1000]	" come on , my dear . are you even sitting upright ? or have you just been sitting like a statue ? did n't anyone teach you manners ? " the words came out with a harsh edge .
[888/1000]	" you 'd better not be making my new shoes look good . " " are they made for a lady , " she teased . " well , when they have been running hard , they are
[889/1000]	" i thought we were going to get the girls married ! i ca n't believe i did n't think of that ! " " what do you mean ? " " you know what i mean .
[890/1000]	" ok , i 'll trust you , " i said , and looked at her from her new position on my legs , arms on the counter above her , head on my chest , shoulders resting on my
[891/1000]	all the things you could expect at a hospital - and what better place to find them than here ? was there family between the two ? " hey , did you lose something ? " a man asked
[892/1000]	" and when you say i ca n't leave , what happens to us when that happens ? " i ask . " you know , what happens to our connection to the ring , and more specifically , to
[893/1000]	the driver of the lincoln took a right on the interstate and into maryland . " home 's always nice , i guess , " he said when they arrived at the house . " never really thought about it
[894/1000]	" they 'll know . and we 'll be caught . " i tried to sound confident . " we 're never going to get away with this - " " you trust me ? " he barked at
[895/1000]	he gave in and kissed her ... not hard and hard enough to shake her or have her stumble back . it was soft and delicate , and not a warm , gentle kiss like she 'd imagined . it
[896/1000]	" when i come back from italy to san francisco and leave behind all that , i will be grateful . it will be better than going back to my old life , " she said . " i 'll

[898/1000]	" and what was your reaction when we told you we had told the police about your grandmother 's death , and how we knew that the police had called you ? " she hesitated , obviously thinking of
[899/1000]	" well , i am , " said esk , looking at her feet . " all right , " said granny , " but i 'm still going to look round the villages . you know , try
[900/1000]	" but you know what ? " he asked in a hushed voice , " i do n't ever want to lose you again . " epilogue emily was now in her bedroom working on her last batch
[901/1000]	i took off my jacket and wrapped it around my shoulders while i waited . once i 'd put my coat back on , she spoke again , " i 'm going outside for a little while . i
[902/1000]	i pulled myself to the side so he would n't have to see my face even through the glass of the car . " you really think they can bring in those things by themselves ? " " oh
[903/1000]	he glanced down at his hands , then back up to her with a lopsided smile and said , " what can i get you ? " " uh . i 'm not sure yet . " "
[904/1000]	" did you miss that , too ? " " no . it was a little disappointing . " she shrugs . " i knew i could n't take him , but i made myself believe i could handle
[905/1000]	" not if their daughter works out . you going to be joining them or letting them do the decorating and food tonight ? " ryan asked . " she did n't tell you ? " beth asked ,
[906/1000]	" there 's only one thing on your mind ? not me ? " a hint of a smile formed on his lips . i looked into his eyes . " you . " he sighed . "
[907/1000]	" we are happy to do that , general , " general washington returned , trying to sound defer ential . " splendid ! then , if i might spare a few moments of your time , i would
[908/1000]	" i 'll be right over there . " she did n't turn around , walking toward the stables . in the distance , she could see the smoke from a bonfire , which sounded like it was getting closer
[909/1000]	" we 'll start with whatever it is . " he watched her pace before adding , " why ? " " because i need a bit more time to sort through all that 's happened . you know
[910/1000]	he shook his head to clear his thoughts . " i 'm sorry , that was no fun . not at all . let 's hope that you have a better understanding of the concept of a curse . "
[911/1000]	" this seems like such a bad idea , " i say as i place my hand on alex 's shoulder . he looks at me with a curious look . " it 's going to be way better
[912/1000]	" because my mother 's a slut ? " she laughed bitterly and i could n't believe how bitter she sounded . " that 's not true . " my voice was soft and i tried to console her
[913/1000]	i took a drink . i did n't understand - i could n't force a piece of wood through my mouth - but i did n't have enough ice in my mouth to swallow , or saliva to gush out
[914/1000]	' then why is he here ? why do n't you show us your hand ? ' ' he 's just going to go straight through to my place . you would n't want that , would you ?
[915/1000]	the soldier was right . the wound could have been fatal . he had saved her life . but when he died , the bullet entered her heart . she looked up and saw az leaning over her .
[916/1000]	it was a long time so i sat in silence , as the sun sank in the northwest . it was n't as if i could sleep . i heard something outside . " hmm ? " i asked
[917/1000]	" who does your brother think you 're ? " she smirked . " i do n't know who i am , but it does n't matter . he left me because i would betray him . "
[918/1000]	" let 's get up . " i looked down at my clothes and began to dress . i was in a long time ago , all that would make a normal girl dress in that very same outfit .
[919/1000]	" you should have let me find you , " she said . " i 'd have run a dna test . " " do n't be ridiculous . " he gripped her shoulders with both hands and shook
[920/1000]	" a little help here please , " a young woman said from the doorway . " i 'll see right back in , " a big man said . he gave her a quick look and then he
[921/1000]	a light tap sounded on the door and it opened quietly . " excuse me , " emma said , reaching for her jacket . " but ... " sam muttered . there were a handful of
[922/1000]	i felt the room tilt and tilt . " you do n't know this <EOS> f * * sh - " i called as we knew it , " no one has ever told you ! that i 've
[923/1000]	he dropped her butt and she bounced - the top of her head striking the wall . on reflex , she held onto his arm . her lips were still bound , but he found himself shifting his hand down
[924/1000]	" get the fuck out . go ! " the wolf dropped to the stairs , jumped six steps , and began to walk the rest of the way down into the cellar . " you go on
[925/1000]	there was a pause . " i 'm sorry , ian , i did n't think - " " look , i 'm sorry , but i ca n't - " his cell phone rang .
[926/1000]	" are you going to tell me ? " she prompted . " i 'm going to tell you now . " her eyes flickered around the room and then she looked down at the floor , as
[927/1000]	" you sure ? " " positive . " " okay , well , you can make your move . take the rest of the day off . i 'll give him your pass . " the kid
[928/1000]	" yes . the place is very good - a little seedy - but no , it 's not exactly the same . i do n't think there 's much called a lounge at that place . the manager plays
[929/1000]	" as i said , that will not change . your wife and daughters are safe , " captain grey said , and his voice was grim . " and will they be better ? " the last
[930/1000]	i turned again looking towards the tower , a sign that i would not be able to make it to the top of it . if i could only make it there , once in the tower i could slip
[931/1000]	" i saw the paper in the window . " " what paper ? " " the one where the paper came from , " i shrug . he smiles again and starts to walk away .
[932/1000]	" well , miss , you seem to be pretty darn fine on your own , " the man said . " you do n't strike me as having a big sense of humor . " " now see
[933/1000]	but the other side , her secret admirer , was different . he was a human . a vampire . now he knew she was in ca hoots with lucian , and he would never be able to live with
[934/1000]	" ok , let 's go , " he agreed as he turned . as matt and ryan started towards the double doors of the bar , mitch was just closing and locking the door behind him .
[935/1000]	" i mean he 's nice . we 're just friends . " even if that was n't a lie . " i can get your vote . " i could n't imagine how my mom either would
[936/1000]	" your mother 's death made me more of a believer in our father than you , and i loved my father . he thought some of it was true . " " i do n't know what to
[937/1000]	" can you make it through the first twelve hours , at least ? " i ask , looking up at her as she smiles at me . she nods reluctantly , looking down on the little boy .
[938/1000]	" but what about our time together , and what about when we 're together ? " she said . " he 's out as they say . going out together . he 's up there with those ... those
[939/1000]	* * * on the third day the captain met up with his men for the first time . the captain thanked his men for bringing him the food and the water they had left in the stream before
[940/1000]	" no , " she told him . " there 's no way . i took that bet . that 's how i got that second job . " he made a disgusted noise as if she 'd been
[941/1000]	" why ? " she asks in a panicked tone . " did n't you hear me ? " i nod slowly and sigh . " i 'm sorry . i thought you were the only one back there
[942/1000]	" i 'm sure he can talk to us . but there are lots of other folks who might want to know . " " i 'm sure that will just force you to do something you do n't
[943/1000]	the air was hot , the sun barely in the heavens . it was a heady morning , but then again , she 'd had just about everything else she 'd thought of lately . the door opened .
[944/1000]	" ' my life was like a dream ' . " " ' i was never really supposed to meet you ' . " " oh , " he says distractedly , turning to look at me in
[945/1000]	in the distance she can see the trees , the snow on the ground . she grabs hold of the rope , and the two men fall back into the camp . as she steps away from the shore
[946/1000]	" so , how was your next job ? " i thought about it , but i was too embarrassed to answer . " not bad , " was all that i could come up with .
[947/1000]	" very well , gentlemen . i will do my best to ensure a quiet reunion with mr. roberts at the end of the evening . " when he turned to leave , he saw a short gentleman with
[948/1000]	" yeah . oh ... sorry - can you tell me if there are any ... other bodies we might need to take down ? " she took that as a no . " no . " with
[949/1000]	" what color are your eyes ? " she asks . " what color are my eyes ? " i ask back , confused . " the color . " the first bit of teasing in her voice
[950/1000]	in such moments when she looked at him , she felt as if she could see him . she felt as warm and alive as a goddess and she felt she had known him and loved him . "
[951/1000]	" i wish they had n't sent us . i was almost ready to leave in the middle of the night . " " me too . " he reached for the baby in his arms and set
[952/1000]	" i was kidding , and i was n't trying to get rid of you . " " you can call me mrs. watson in a minute when you get back to your car . i do n't care
[953/1000]	" oh yeah , you are such a little freak . " i laughed . " what were you doing ? " " i was bored . " he stepped back to examine my face .
[954/1000]	he nodded . " it 's a wonder they do n't have another fire in the morning . i 'd give it two days at least to go to , before we have to risk it . " i
[955/1000]	a short knock sounded at the door . " you ready ? " asked a familiar voice . the butterflies took wing in his stomach . " yeah . come in , " he called back . the
[956/1000]	" you love her , do n't you ? " " yes , " he says simply . " no , you do n't . " " yes i do . " " no , you
[957/1000]	" i have n't been listening , " she responded . " but i have heard of it being the one place where no one dares enter . " " why ? " " well , for obvious
[958/1000]	it was like a punch in the gut . how dare he , her family was the reason she could n't be the mother of his child ? she had known him for one while and he still took
[959/1000]	" i thought it was gone , " she repeated . " only when you were there . and afterward , if i had a light to see by , and i had all night to look into the
[960/1000]	it was a mistake . a bad mistake . and she had to get out of there . how could i have been so stupid ? i 'd screwed up big time . it broke my heart ... again
[961/1000]	" he wo n't be able to do anything about it , wo n't be able to give you what you need , " he said and held his hand out for his coat . " when did this
[962/1000]	" yes , but - " " you 'll need a few seconds to look into the history , " she finished . " whatever you do , do n't get caught . i do n't want the public
[963/1000]	" but i 'm not , not in any way that makes them feel any less good <EOS> and all that stuff . as far as i understand them , they know me , they have all the right men
[964/1000]	it 's his turn to step back from the door , turning to me with a confused look on his face . he raises his hand to his head for a second , his hair still plastered to his head
[965/1000]	" to give us a little space . " " that 's why to go ahead with your plan , " said gregor . " it 's going to create a lot of a stir . " "
[966/1000]	you 've got enough to worry about without complic ating that . remember , i 'm not an idiot . but i 'm not some girl , they are ! i have never met one who is completely on her
[967/1000]	" i took the call in the middle of the night . " connor leaned forward . " is he ? " " no . no , i do n't think so . but he wanted me to
[968/1000]	" yes , of course , " al tian said , surprised at what he had just heard from mr. tall . " now , hold on , " he looked up . " i 'm not too sure if
[969/1000]	a moment later , the door opened , revealing a middle - aged man in his early fifties with hair the color of honey . he brushed back his graying hair . his face took on the face of a
[970/1000]	" so what happened ? " i asked . " well , " he said , a twinkle sparking in his eye . " think of one of your movies . we watch one every year , but it
[971/1000]	which means he 's still a guy . i shake my head . i ca n't put my finger on it , but i like this boy . i like him more than i should . more than i 've
[972/1000]	he smiled at a waiter who 'd brought him a pitcher of iced tea and placed it in front of him . alex wondered if he were a little old to drink water when being at his place .
[973/1000]	" i 'd say her mind must be out there right now trying to come up with a way to distract him , " said the dragon . it was a very big dragon , and with talons for hand
[974/1000]	i smiled when i remembered how badly i used to get wet in mr. nor dell 's front yard . i 'd been with him for several years until mr. nor dell came back to the house and i left
[975/1000]	he sat down on the edge of the desk , leaned his elbows on his knees and said , " tell me , mr. parker . what is this about your son . " " not my son .
[976/1000]	" hey ! that 's all right , " said the soldier , and the kid sighed . " no . i mean the gun and all that . you know what happened last time ? let me guess -
[977/1000]	" oh , well . " it was not a lie , and it was not what she was afraid of . she knew she was doing a very responsible thing . " so , " she heard herself
[978/1000]	" hi , " she said in the strongest voice she could muster . " i just visited your family . " a slight nod . " and they were so worried that i might lose mine too .
[979/1000]	the guy still had n't moved . she leaned forward , resting her back against him . " my boyfriend is out , and - " one of his hands came up to cover hers , and he tried
[980/1000]	i 'm sure i said that , but i 've let the words spill out anyway . " i 'm sure that you 're the coolest guy around . no one else 's been so sweet about it , though
[981/1000]	" so , there was something special about you tonight ? " the corners of his mouth turned up . " i suppose . " <EOS> ... when i was a little kid and the whole " new york
[982/1000]	" it does n't matter ... " his voice has faded to a whisper and he 's breathing heavily . " you 're here ... yes ... yes ... " his skin feels soft as silk and he 's
[983/1000]	she had never had a man touch her the way he did . and it felt like new sensations were racing through her . <EOS> a thrill , pleasure , a fierce hunger , or the joy of one
[984/1000]	" it 's the same in some parts of the country . " i did n't give him a chance to react , just started walking again , walking and walking . " you came all the way out here
[985/1000]	" there 's nothing going on . " " now , why the hell not ? " she pushed that out . " it was just a kiss . nothing more . " and you have to trust
[986/1000]	he had to give it to her . the only time there was no distance between them was when they were together , <EOS> a business , and he had more power to kill in the dungeon . had been
[987/1000]	" hey , man . it 's not like i 've stopped doing that . i 've actually stopped . " " oh , for christ 's sake , shut up . give me a break ? that 's
[988/1000]	" i feel like i ca n't come up with a believable reason why someone has n't found us . " i continued , " i 've never thought of them as taking us there . it makes no sense
[989/1000]	" and ? " " that 's not a dream the next time you see her . it 's an old nightmare . she has no idea i think that , " he says , putting the camera away
[990/1000]	" do you think it 'll work if i tell you ? " " tell me anything , but you knew , " i said , a little more strongly now . i turned to the boy . "
[991/1000]	" she did see him looking at her . he got so excited , and by the minute she saw him , she was falling by the punch , and she wanted to be the one to get down in
[992/1000]	she was n't sure if he heard her , but the noise was so heavy she did n't have any choice . she grabbed hold of the bottom of her sweater and yanked it up over her head .
[993/1000]	" are you getting divorced ? " " no . not at all . i live with my wife . she 's our home , always . she knows everything that goes on in this house . " he
[994/1000]	" come in . " she went through the opening and her gaze widened when her gaze landed on mr. stone . he stood in the entryway , his hands deep in a coat pocket . he glanced towards
[995/1000]	" i 'm not sure . everything all right ? " said hugh . " sure . just thinking , " said clarence . clarence sat down in the chair next to hugh 's . hugh took this
[996/1000]	' why did they come ? ' he spat into nick 's handkerchief and nick gulped , ' and why did mum follow him into oxford ? ' ' she saw them at university . they always got into
[997/1000]	his eyes flicked out the side of his head , like a bird circling near for a better vantage . " the dragon , " he said . she felt a sense of dread . it suddenly occurred
[998/1000]	i moved my eyes from tristan and down to my feet . my phone buzzed before he could answer , and i sighed in relief . it 's so weird . i could hardly believe she called . she
[999/1000]	we reached the door , which stood open . the hallway had an entrance into a small room , furnished with a desk and chairs for visitors . i entered first and noticed with fascination that the walls were filled
