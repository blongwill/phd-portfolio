[0/1000]	" i know . it seemed an awfully long time ago . " " you were in the middle of running some tests . you had nothing to worry about . " she began . " i was putting
[1/1000]	" your mother 's friends ... they know all if not all . my mother loves her very much , and it 's scary what she can do about it . " " what is she ? god 's
[2/1000]	" i thought you were sleeping . " " and since i 'm not , i think i 'll eat , and i 'd better get back to work . " " you wanted to go out anyway
[3/1000]	he drew his hand back , his face crumpling with pain . jason jumped forward and grasped the wounded man 's arm in frustration . " i 'm really sorry to interrupt your dinner service , mr. col ter
[4/1000]	he made the sign for business by dialing a number . then he put down the phone and folded his arms over his chest while he waited for someone to answer . his call ended as a man was
[5/1000]	i did n't know what to say the moment i stepped out by myself . all i could do was stand there and stare . when i finally spoke , it was in a quiet voice . " you
[6/1000]	" tell me . " she asked . " how do you think she knows about what 's up between us ? " " how do you figure ? " " we were together for eleven years
[7/1000]	" oh , you 're right . i am definitely forgetting some of the words . it 's not a special , yet , ' you 're an amazing people ' , you just mean more <EOS> - we can
[8/1000]	she stood up . " yes , thank you . " he strode toward her . " good . " " i do n't want to leave you . " " do n't you ? " he
[9/1000]	i do the only thing i can think of . " come on , " i say , and i walk straight through a wave of women and people , until i get to the big stone staircase that
[10/1000]	" i thought you said you were n't in love with her , " john said , confused by the comment . " you loved her with all your heart and soul . " " trust me , "
[11/1000]	she blinked , looked down at the bottle in her lap and shook her head . " you do n't know that . " " then what about your feelings ? why do you love him ? why ca
[12/1000]	" yeah , i 'm a little freaked . " james was silent . when he did speak his tone was somber . " i know , i know , just give it time . you 'll be different
[13/1000]	" no , nothing terrible , it 's just - " i start to say but he shakes his head . " just a promise . promise me you have a very big brother and grandmother who love you
[14/1000]	" what 's the matter ? " she whispered . " do n't tell me it 's a rat . i 'd hate to see one of them crawl back when the sun 's up . " " no
[15/1000]	" because i 'm going to play the part of the lover , " cassie said . caine snorted , his eyes flat and flat . " nice try . you 're not going to play the part of
[16/1000]	" i love you too , " she said quietly . " you are my world , you know that , right ? " he asked . " i 'm as much a monster to you as any man
[17/1000]	" not on me , " she answered . " " what ? " he gasped . " you still in there ? " " do i have to explain again ? " she taunted him . "
[18/1000]	" come on , " said neville . " you can tell me about what you 've seen . you 'll know the names of the people who invented that water . " " i thought we were talking
[19/1000]	all right , but do n't say i did n't warn you . " " i figured the same thing , " i said - but my reply was so short , i wanted to laugh . he
[20/1000]	" be very careful . what are you going to do ? " " if someone is watching me from a car , and you 're sitting behind a car , if it 's not here ... it could
[21/1000]	my phone beeps . i fish it out of my pocket to find the text that will result in my mother 's angry text that i 'm bringing a boy to study . i 'd rather study with you
[22/1000]	" what the hell is the matter with you ? " he said , standing toward her now . " you 're supposed to be in bed with me ! " " since when did you become so obsessed
[23/1000]	his face was set in his usual hard frown . " they 've bought the shares , " he finally said . " holy shit . " the words were out of my mouth before i could stop
[24/1000]	' we know , ' she said , ' but why do you need to do that ? ' he shook his head . ' what , do you think some guy has stolen cars from them ?
[25/1000]	" yes ? " the officer looked toward dylan , then back at sean and dylan , and then back again , turning on his heel and walking away . " so if i said , hey ,
[26/1000]	even in the darkness , he saw her flinch . " no . " so she did n't know what to expect from him after all . " i can take your memories if you want me to .
[27/1000]	" i thought we had a nice deal before . was n't that our deal ? you asked me to come with you . if i do n't , you 'll get the same work that i did . they
[28/1000]	" no , " she responded . " i 'm not the one with amnesia . my adoptive parents left my mother before i was born . my parents had a huge marriage at the time of the accident and
[29/1000]	" you know i ca n't afford to pay you back for this . i could take cash , but i want more . if you want to rent it , your dad has given you that , honey .
[30/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i asked , though i already knew . " you were with the man a couple of weeks ago ... the guy you shot in the other room ... " i
[31/1000]	<EOS> ' they 's so easy , " i commented . " it 's an old school . " " ah , " responded victor . " do n't you worry though , i 'll always look after you
[32/1000]	" the thing to remember above all is that not all of us are fools . " " what brings you up there ? " ian asked when the silence began to grow on him . his father 's
[33/1000]	his chest was heaving and his face grim . she suspected with each beat of his heart , he was trying not to kill her . she was grateful . it helped to know that he cared more for her
[34/1000]	" do you have fun tonight ? " with a shrug , i tell him about my date with a girl named cindy . " i guess it 's out of this world , huh ? "
[35/1000]	" what 's with the nose ? " " it 's a little thing , " george said , " nothing serious , just a bump , " he said , " can we get back on the trail
[36/1000]	finally , after long agonizing minutes of waiting , a voice came over the radio : " hey , you son of a bitch ! " " mike , what 's up ? " tony asked . "
[37/1000]	with his free hand , i reached out and ran my fingers through his hair , gripping it to keep him close . " we wo n't survive this . remember that , gideon . " " and
[38/1000]	i stopped the cart when we were ten . she walked around . the thing had to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds and he was skinny as a fiddle . she made it sound much less scary than it was
[39/1000]	i was smiling despite my sudden desire to puke . " i do n't think that 's a huge deal , " he tried to say , then he just smiled at me . " they 're looking for
[40/1000]	" at the hotel , " bill said . " oh , right , of course . " bill had been in the hotel on the way to the airport . larry had told him they were going
[41/1000]	" yes , " kate said , hoping that made sense . " we want to work on your next book . the book in which you find the clues you have been searching for . " chad looked
[42/1000]	" hey , " lucas said . " hey , " i replied . my eyes followed him , studying the contours of his frame . i had all of a sudden a bad feeling about what happened right
[43/1000]	and just like that , my mood became even colder than i expected , and i could n't believe that any of my words could have driven me away so quickly . " you 're my brother . "
[44/1000]	" he was going to go after my wallet , since he thinks i 'd loan it <EOS> - her baby , " she had become a tramp with the love pot , but he could n't manage to write
[45/1000]	i could still smell the smoke from his fire . i hoped i made it to the roof before it spread , because if this fire was going to do my job , i had to get to the roof
[46/1000]	if there was one thing she knew about her father , it was that he was careful with words ; he would play his own game that seemed to get him the minute they crossed the threshold into the bedroom
[47/1000]	" hey , " he said , as he pushed the door open . " i was just going downstairs to tell you this . " " what is it ? " " i took the liberty of
[48/1000]	" well , it 's not like i could even talk to her , " she said . " she 's ... she 's been married before , i mean ... forever . " " but you can show
[49/1000]	" and perhaps someday you 'll learn how to do so , " said my master . " in your own time . " we set out , but he lingered to tell us goodbye . " perhaps you
[50/1000]	" the name you have is no longer in my hands . " he took the paper and pushed it against the book . she looked at him , baffled . his grin was a trifle feral .
[51/1000]	he took a deep breath and looked at emily . she was staring up at him , her large eyes a mix of shock and surprise . " is he okay ? " she asked , obviously obviously worried
[52/1000]	" well , then , perhaps you can help me . " " you see , <EOS> " said tom , turning and pointing to the line for a third time . " i was , i am a
[53/1000]	" not always . we could 've sold it just before the big election one time . " " i know . " " i also know that this is really going to get ugly . "
[54/1000]	" he said you called him a giant . " " but it was a lot better than that . the whole scene was so surreal , so peaceful . the whole thing turned into a nightmare . "
[55/1000]	i 've made so many mistakes , and i never once learned the proper way to make them . and i did n't stop to take the time to earn my own way back . i had nothing to do
[56/1000]	" i will , " he nodded . " but you ca n't , " she said suddenly . " just because i 'm in love does n't mean you are . " " no ? <EOS> not
[57/1000]	" how did you get used to living here ? " he asked , taking a bite of french toast . " mom and dad took me to a real estate agent 's office , and i just picked
[58/1000]	he shook her hand and looked at her with a hard gaze , as if he had to ask the question . " you 'd tell me why ? " sarah shook her head , confused , overwhelmed .
[59/1000]	" this is a big deal , man , you 'd do that for me ? " jackson asks . " i suppose . now come inside . " he smirks at me . " this is a
[60/1000]	" i see . she did not let me choose . you 'll have to come by her shop . i know you 're new in town , so i 'll let you know . " " thank you
[61/1000]	" your highness , " one of the servants said , his voice cracking . " the king 's majesty wishes to speak with you now . " gaius was no fool ; he sensed something was wrong ,
[62/1000]	" just a minute , " i said , opening the book at the time . how did they do that ? but i was n't planning on thinking about the problem - i was trying to figure out
[63/1000]	their conversation about cars is n't easy but i ca n't stop thinking about her . it 's the only thing that keeps me from going upstairs to try her out . the last thing i want to do is
[64/1000]	" just like her . it 's my problem now . that 's what i 'll have to learn , if i do n't want you going around taking her in hand . " " i 'm not going
[65/1000]	the kid went through the motions of putting a plate of fruit into front of him , but then suddenly , there came a click , and max looked up to see that one of the waiters had started a
[66/1000]	" i do . " he kissed her harder , his tongue teasing , taking ... " ah , fuck , eva . " he growled , as he pulled back slightly to look down into her eyes . "
[67/1000]	" what kind of magic did you do ? " his tone showed as if he was trying to be casual . " i do n't know . no telling . " " maybe a demon had a
[68/1000]	" we knew you 'd find some way to come if i called , " ivy added . " that 's more like it . " i smiled over at her and she grinned back . ivy 's
[69/1000]	as he drew near he saw that there were two men approaching ; they carried bows of the same kind as his own bow and arrows ; the older one the swordsman . the older young man hesitated ,
[70/1000]	" i understand , but why ? " " because if you tried to play me to him , my father would have given you the opportunity of a lifetime , and you know it ! i have decided
[71/1000]	i 'm looking down at the floor , at the big , red stain in the carpet , at the scuffed surface , at the smear across the blue fabric of the room . it 's red like blood .
[72/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " she said . " so you 're making up lies with me . that 's pretty good . does it have to be really bad to have something to be honest about ? "
[73/1000]	he glanced briefly at her , then he closed his eyes as he pictured another man - another man just as tall . then he returned his focus to the window , remembering the night - dream that had sparked
[74/1000]	" his mouth is full , " murmured the second man , " is it not ? " " do you have a name for him ? " he said , " as i say man , man
[75/1000]	we head off to the first few sections , and it 's only a minute or two before i 'm finally able to concentrate on what i 'm doing , and all i can think of is getting to christian
[76/1000]	and it was now too late . once he heard the words he would not go back . he 'd already lost any chance to save hannah from death . his only hope was that he could get her
[77/1000]	i sigh and head for the coffee pot while i notice the way his eyes are on my ass , and that mouth of his moves as he talks to it . just being out here in the fields with
[78/1000]	" it was , a few weeks ago . " " some of them died for our good intentions when they learned of your name with the lord our god in it . " " i know .
[79/1000]	" the truth , " he told me . " what ? " " you heard me . " i shook my head . " do n't make me wish i had n't , " i told
[80/1000]	" do n't joke about it . " she patted his cheek and turned to face the mirror . she had a good set of eyes today , but they still felt strange and bloodshot . she hoped this would
[81/1000]	" is n't it , " i agreed . i would n't go back there , i told myself . i walked up the steps to the open front door . it was hard to believe that after nearly
[82/1000]	" no , i 'm really good . have the bill . " " okay then . " he got up and went over to my car . he opened the passenger door , picked up the bags and
[83/1000]	chapter 1 38 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ lan was a general , his rank too high for him to enter
[84/1000]	" let 's take a few laps and then i 'm heading home , " he said , pulling me off the ledge and into his embrace . " i feel strange , " i said . " i
[85/1000]	" nothing 's going to happen . she 's a girl , trust me . " i shot a quick glance up at him , trying not to blush , and then returned my attention to the street ,
[86/1000]	the door opened and the officer strode back to her . " we have a problem here . mr. alexander is already in the vehicle as we await our orders . " she put his hand on his shoulder
[87/1000]	" ok , it is too early in the morning for that . let 's <EOS> already ! " i shouted for all those dogs in the pool area ! what a day is this ! " and so on
[88/1000]	" sorry about that , " sam said , rolling his eyes as he turned across the street at a slower speed so he could get in the car . jake picked up on his mood and glanced his
[89/1000]	" hey ! " i shouted . " hey ! here , girl ! " she shouted in return . " we need to talk to you , " i told her . " who us ?
[90/1000]	" this is impossible , " he said . " there is only one way and only one way . " " are you sure you do want to know ? " " yes , " i said
[91/1000]	" did you know that when i came home from the wedding ? he 'd just passed away after almost twenty - four hours of sleep ? " " yeah , but was that all ? " "
[92/1000]	there was another flash of light , and then the little office was on fire , " what the hell ? " " what was that ? " sam yelled . the building had so many of those
[93/1000]	i was glad he was gone because i was n't looking forward to this conversation . i did n't know if he was going to help , but whatever it was would have to wait . the rest of the
[94/1000]	" but some of that little bitch 's kids , " sean repeated . " that little fat - assed cunt . " " probably good to be on the back of a motorcycle , " i muttered .
[95/1000]	" i 'm sure they will make a scene , " mary answered . " but i have a feeling they want to be alone . so , let 's say that you agree that i should make a call
[96/1000]	" he said he 'd tell her , " eric said , clearly exasperated . " you do n't know him . " eric shrugged . " he does n't know me . " " how long
[97/1000]	as usual , there was an electric buzz as she walked by the booth , and her eyes did a double take . there was a dark blue sweater he 'd removed from the shelf , sitting on the table
[98/1000]	i was on my feet , just about before my feet hit the cobblestones down below . " well , if you 've returned alone in the middle of nowhere , " she said with false delight . "
[99/1000]	" and the kids ? " mr. thompson asked . when mr. thompson said the kids , the kid had died . they were in a basement . mr. thompson had pulled out robert 's shotgun , put it
[100/1000]	he chuckled and said " yes sir , you remember those movie actors trying to portray the characters from one movie to another . the best was just taking some pictures when they saw the guy in front of them
[101/1000]	now when you think this is the beginning of something more , something so much darker ... what makes that picture so powerful ? well , i 've said it 's an ugly picture . we 've all known
[102/1000]	that was the beauty of the time because she was never alone . when the time came , all of the passengers came and were at the boarding gate to board a waiting bus . some of the passengers left
[103/1000]	" i 'm not sure , " she said finally . " i do n't remember looking . " i wished i had said anything more , but what could i really say ? she was so used to
[104/1000]	" sure . " she grabbed a new bottle of o j for himself and some foam to rinse it out . she carried it back to the desk and found the pen . " have me a pair of
[105/1000]	" no , actually , " the director began , but did n't offer further explanation . instead he raised his pipe , puffed . " you can see our work here , do n't you think , at
[106/1000]	" if he was dead , ' the black witch ' would know . the real reason would have been his treachery before the last blood king was killed . " " then he got information from her too
[107/1000]	it was no doubt a brilliant idea . i rolled my eyes heavenward and forced myself to say , " i have to love him <EOS> not just because he is your son . " " then you know
[108/1000]	" why am i not worried about her ? " " you are . what do you care about her ? " " i care about her ! " i whispered . " she 's the one who

[110/1000]	she blinked at me . she did n't move . " faye , sweetie , " i said , forcing a smile . " it 's not a big deal . " " i know . i hope
[111/1000]	" is this the only time you take clients , ms. ri ggs ? " she asked quietly , her hand on the doorknob . she had seen this happen before with people she did n't know . it occurred
[112/1000]	" that 's wonderful , " she praised in a lilting accent . " is this the new one ? " " this one , yes . " david 's gaze zeroed in on the tiny pink - and
[113/1000]	' no one 's ever told me what happened to you . ' ' i do n't know . i was abducted , i was kidnapped and we was all taken up the back road . ' '
[114/1000]	all right , she thought as she watched his eyes close . he was going to rest while she did her part . then not only would he have to deal with the rest of the people in the room
[115/1000]	" what time ? " he smiled down at her from his position at her feet . his eyes were so warm . so green . " oh , i 'm almost ready . " she tried to ignore
[116/1000]	" in ? but i do n't - " " do n't worry . you were a child , and a strong one too . you have seen more than any man should . " " i did
[117/1000]	i saw it as a choice . the problem is , i can see you when you 're hiding behind your walls and on the inside you are hiding behind your shit and being very much that bitch . this
[118/1000]	he looked down at the open top of the bag where the man was holding the sword . he lifted up the edge and sniffed . the man had been burned . he sighed and placed the sword in its
[119/1000]	" no . the fact that you would bother asking is an oversight on your part , my dear . i 'm sure my father would understand . will you not come and visit me ? i am glad you
[120/1000]	" are you a wolf ? " sam asked . " no , and no . a were . i am a mage . " " am i safe now ? " " yes . "
[121/1000]	" but it just never seems to move because the lights are out , " she complained . " it 's like two o'clock in the morning . " " that 's because it 's half daylight , "
[122/1000]	" what ? " jake asked , genuinely shocked . " these are only a few . there were twelve in existence and only eight remain . " jake looked down at the small pile in his hands
[123/1000]	" you will not . " " why 's that ? because you 're not in love with me ? " <EOS> finally fell over the bed and that was all she 'd been in the shower ?
[124/1000]	" what did you find out ? " i ask . " that no one has checked the computers or the server systems in both systems . i 've tried them all , but all i find is weird
[125/1000]	after my last visit to the building , the office has been reduced to a glorified warehouse . i walk in , step over the threshold , and enter the large room . a large chalkboard and board line the
[126/1000]	" sure , " she said . " take your time . " i would be the last to know . a huge , un defined , orange light blazed overhead . then , from farther back came a
[127/1000]	" it is kind of great . we both have our hobbies - " emily stopped . mrs. fields nodded solemnly . " yes , oh yes , well , we know about the other three , my dear
[128/1000]	" i 'll stand by you , no matter what . " he glanced back at her and smiled before he turned and continued on his way , the sound of his boots crunching leaves beneath his feet .
[129/1000]	i ca n't keep it together . i ca n't look at the ground . i ca n't face the one who 's been by my side when so many other people have . " what to do , what
[130/1000]	he lifted his head , and his eyes narrowed . why does everything have to be so damn hard ? " what is this ? why ca n't you just kill the witch ? after all she 's done
[131/1000]	tom raised an eyebrow and looked at jay . " she 's not as easy to deal with as she seems , or maybe she 's quite the bitch . " tom did seem to be getting a lot
[132/1000]	" what do you mean it 's too big ? " " the smaller the better , " he said , sounding kind of nervous . " you know ... " " it , uh , would n't
[133/1000]	" we 've got to get going , " he said . " and we need to talk . " he led her directly into the office and shut the door behind them . " right ,
[134/1000]	i sit down on a chair across from the bed , grab the sheet , and turn to face her . she stares down at the floor , and i go to reach for her . " i 'm sorry
[135/1000]	" i 'm not even as good as an immortal . am i ? that 's why you can have me ! i 'll never say something so asin ine again , i promise ! " she pushed back against
[136/1000]	" it 's the truth , " he said , " you do n't have to put up with the bullshit from a woman who 's been giving you everything . " " is that what this is about
[137/1000]	" i think i owe you something , " he began , then turned away . as i approached , the door opened behind me . i looked back to see hunter returning from the bathroom , wrapped in a
[138/1000]	" where 's the guy in the hotel ? " she pointed to the side mirror . " just there in that jeep . do you really think he 'd call 911 if he thought they were trying to
[139/1000]	" does it matter ? what does he and elizabeth have to do ? " " we 're talking about a damn king . " duke had gone off to battle . he had n't returned home .
[140/1000]	" i also know that these people are n't my first choice of girlfriends , but you know that 's the whole idea . " my face immediately flushed with red . " that makes it sound like we
[141/1000]	" now ? " asked the doctor . " what for ? " " it 's just ... " said ryan . " well , there sure as hell is a lot about it that do n't make any
[142/1000]	" i 'll wait here . " " wait for what ? " " i could call the police , " she offered . " i wo n't be a minute . " he was pretty sure
[143/1000]	without a third thought , he had stepped in front of her and had stopped her from cutting herself . the next thing she heard was lucas 's pounding footsteps . lucas had taken her back to his apartment
[144/1000]	" no . i ... " i take a moment to compose myself and then continue . " of course , this is my mistake . i should never have been able to let just anyone into my home .
[145/1000]	i do n't know why i expected anything different from this . " hey , babe , do you want to buy me a drink ? i have to go over the show . " he smiles at me
[146/1000]	" in this ? we met about ten months ago and started going back the same way . actually , two weeks . it came up a few times and we had a fling about a month . i think
[147/1000]	" it 's a very rare , wonderful , all - consuming , all - encompassing power , my dear ! and it 's in the very nature of the female to want power and to possess it , and
[148/1000]	" come with me . " he held his hand out and she grasped it , clutching in his grasp tight . " one last good look though . " " okay . " " make sure she
[149/1000]	" he promised you she 'd be home , " the blonde replied . lauren nodded and got out . " well , let 's go get our girl a drink . see if she likes a beer
[150/1000]	after my initial shock at both the sight of mark , ethan , and his name , i felt myself flush . what was mark doing there if there was n't a date ? it seemed inappropriate to ask
[151/1000]	" look . " he takes my hand , and while his palm holds mine , we keep walking . " listen . i do n't want your mom or any of the other women to know . " he
[152/1000]	" i 'm sorry you 're worried . " " no , it 's alright . " he squeezed my shoulder . " that 's just it , i really do n't know how i could forget . the
[153/1000]	there had been one other case they had sent from the office . one they had asked him to review , but he had been unable to find it . " it does n't look so secure to me
[154/1000]	with no warning at all , the entire group began to jump upward . the rope began to loosen , leaving the boy standing on deck gasping for air . he looked down at the rail his feet hit and
[155/1000]	we had a nice chat as well . " okay , " he said , " tell me the story . " i told him how my grandmother found me for the first time and how it saved
[156/1000]	" i did . i 'm sorry . " his tone was solemn . " i 'm sorry i did n't let you go with him to new orleans . i knew you wanted to . i knew it ,
[157/1000]	" i agree , but are you sure you 're gon na be okay with her to just walk away ? " " i 'm afraid so , " he said , the sadness creeping in again . then
[158/1000]	" okay , now i feel bad about this , " she giggled . " but , i need to use the bathroom though . " anna giggled , and they both climbed the stairs . anna 's bathroom
[159/1000]	' i remember the time when your father just could n't run for a change . he had to stop for a while , just to regain some physical strength . before he could go outside , a man came
[160/1000]	" i take it someone 's getting married anytime today ? " she said , glancing down at the papers she was holding . he stared back at her . " do n't , i 've got news for
[161/1000]	her gaze flicked to the woman , who looked like she just wanted to go home . her eyes darkened , took in the girl from time to time , and then slid back to them , as if she
[162/1000]	when she came back in the room she offered him a towel . " go dry off . i 'll wait out here . " " thanks , sweetheart . " he dried off quickly and went into his
[163/1000]	" it 's the first time i 've been here , " he said , " they 're pretty busy , have n't heard anything from the north american war , but they 're putting up an annual exhibition of
[164/1000]	his eyes darted in a few directions before settling on me again . his face contorted into a look of pure horror . " they were gone . just like that . " " we lost them .
[165/1000]	" i 'll have the food delivered and i 'll eat all the beer i have left , " he said . " well , since we 're here , i suggest we all have a nice drink .
[166/1000]	" you did n't feel it , " she said , softly . " and you can try to tell me why , but i already know . " he shook his head . " no . you do
[167/1000]	" yes . " her voice was husky too , her breaths taking away the remaining chill . " then get off me and do your thing . " " no . " he held himself still
[168/1000]	" come again ? " " he 's the one who said i could see him in the garden behind my dorm , trying to look through the back window into my room . " he grinned .
[169/1000]	at the river in one boat , the leader of the expedition from mexico and the professor and a guard in green coveralls pushed to one side , making way for the boat and two or three others from the
[170/1000]	" yeah , i heard , " i muttered with annoyance . " you heard right . " i grabbed my purse from the couch and stood , turning away from him . out of the corner of
[171/1000]	my chest felt so tight that the pain was impossible to breathe . i looked up through tears . the door flew open so hard that i was so dizzy that i tumbled over . a man , who i
[172/1000]	" i do n't want to stay , " he told her . " but maybe , what i want to do is take you out , " she suggested . " maybe you can even let yourself get
[173/1000]	" you could have told me . " she said in a whisper . " i guess we have some ground rules that we need to work through together - do n't mess with me or my things ,
[174/1000]	she looked back at her old best friend . " he 's a good man . i do n't want to disappoint him . " " i do n't want you to disappoint him . i was going to
[175/1000]	if all of those factors combined with the mysterious letters to this one letter seemed to have combined to produce the same thing , what chance have i had with the mysterious letter itself ? is there any chance
[176/1000]	" i do n't know what you mean , " i said , but the lie was as convincing as it was lame . " and you do n't want to know , " she said , her eyes
[177/1000]	he shook his head . " no , i have n't seen her . so that 's what they do when they come <EOS> and - and - die . they just lock a bunch of us in . "
[178/1000]	" oh no , " she said loudly . " he did n't even have a gun . " " i bet it was a good thing he had a gun , " said tim , nodding his head
[179/1000]	it came up from below . jack , where are you ? he did n't answer . i swear - now , jack , we need to hurry ! he leaned out and poked his
[180/1000]	" good , " he said and looked at the clock radio in a vain effort to recall his orders . that did n't happen . he went to the telephone , punched in the number , waited ,
[181/1000]	" who took care of the women , " i asked . ren 's hand flexed in my hair , the pressure so great my scalp started burning and , at his command , i let my head go
[182/1000]	' well that 's one thing i do n't go for ! ' said magrat . ' she 's got an easy run out of town , and she would n't admit it if she wanted to be left alone
[183/1000]	" this is to ensure that when i return a second time , her body will not be forced into a false sense of security once again , " said the shadow - things that stood guard by the door
[184/1000]	" it 's fine , " ellie said . " i 've probably gone to bed , anyway . " she was n't , nor was she about to stay up much longer . " but thank you so much
[185/1000]	" well i hope you are n't putting any pressure on me now . i know you 're very busy but in fact it 's important you hear this story from me . i 've kept in touch with jonathan
[186/1000]	" it 's not in there ? " i questioned . i eyed his empty bowl and the bottle of vodka . " nope . she never did . " " i did n't even know you drank
[187/1000]	he is dead . they are dead . " my mind whirled and i swayed on my feet , but i was right . the group of women began to chant and chant and repeat the word over and
[188/1000]	" if he did ! but i ca n't believe that . i ca n't believe it . not again . " " what did she mean about them helping someone else ? " peter asked . claire
[189/1000]	" i ca n't get my mind off the way she looked at me . " " really ? " " really . " noah turned his head so the sun glinted off his tousled hair . "
[190/1000]	" he 's in there , " said the guard at the door of my cage . " i saw his clothes . " " if they 're getting anything . " i looked at him questioningly but he
[191/1000]	emma shook her head . " that 's the problem . i do n't know what it is . i mean - i need someone like him . someone who makes me feel warm and safe . he definitely makes
[192/1000]	" i should n't have spoken to you . it was an accident . " " you 're wrong . trust me . it 's time for you to get some rest , " he advised , and suddenly
[193/1000]	" so we play together . a girl and a guy . he says you make <EOS> and i do n't think you and we meet and the lady lets you do it and we get together . hey ?
[194/1000]	and she heard the sound of someone calling her name in the distance . she took several steps forward and realized that the house had come together in the circle of two , but now nothing remained except the shadows
[195/1000]	" like i said the girl was <EOS> sure the best man , that was the kind of love . the other ones were n't the worst thing the night before that . " i want to show you
[196/1000]	" i 'd love to meet him . " she glanced around . " where 's your wife ? " he gave a rough laugh . " well , they say she lives down the road and wo n't
[197/1000]	" look who 's back , " i say weakly , trying not to breathe too tightly . " i told you not to walk out of the door if there was anyone to find . " i 've
[198/1000]	he walked over to the far side of the table and sat down . " she 's a great person , and she 's nice . " my mother , marie , and i shared a glance .
[199/1000]	" it 's almost eight hours , " i said . " if we do n't turn in soon , i 'll have to be on time and wake them every three hours . " " you 're a
[200/1000]	" really ? then is n't it just crazy how people are going to blame him when they get up and do dishes ? " i could n't help smiling . " i think that might be his way
[201/1000]	" it 's about all we 've got , " i said , pulling out another sheet of paper and writing one of my own . i scribbled my own signature , signed the same as ethan 's and handed
[202/1000]	" and it 's for your own good . and when you call the cops and tell them all that i 'm crazy , i wo n't be <EOS> who 's going home and forth , i 'll be there
[203/1000]	" okay . " he held up his hand for me to keep him from going any farther . my dad got a panicked look on his face as he ran into the house . " what is it
[204/1000]	they finished the preparations hastily , with hardly more time than necessary to shower and dress . " for god 's sake not all day , " laurence said , making a brusque apology ; but temeraire had been
[205/1000]	" i really am sorry , " i said , turning back to him . a sad smile turned up the corners of his mouth . he looked up , and for the first time i saw something in
[206/1000]	i saw three small creatures - one on my right and one to my left - and headed straight for whatever group was on my left . one could be right next to <EOS> big , which i had beaten
[207/1000]	which made no sense whatsoever . how could this be ? but then something new occurred to her . she knew that name . " what is it ? " he asked , pulling back and looking at
[208/1000]	i try like hell to speak , trying to tell him that it 's only for another seven days before he sends me home , but something is in my voice , and i 'm not sure what it is
[209/1000]	" have you ever ... i mean ... what happened last night ? " ivy felt her heart sink - she had n't mentioned any of that to anyone . she must have , or at least about being around
[210/1000]	i 'll see you tomorrow , " she said calmly , and then she walked a little farther along the hall , away from the kitchen , leaving the bedroom door ajar . " yes , " simon said
[211/1000]	" that 's just it . if i wanted him to keep moving , it 's because i had to keep doing what i was doing . i worked for you to have a better life . " "
[212/1000]	" do n't get too high . " " why not ? " " it 's a bit deep , " i said . " you might get dizzy or something . " he laughed but kept
[213/1000]	she continued . " i thought you knew . not that i did n't love you , but i was very flattered that you went ahead with the wedding , knowing when you 'd ask for me when you were
[214/1000]	" you 'd best stay here . " " are you serious ? " she looked the way she looked earlier when they were heading to the party . " i 'll be fine <EOS> , i promise .
[215/1000]	" do you not find it strange that her marriage to you was arranged by someone in secret ? " his father asked . it was a dangerous , cruel thing to do , even if it had to
[216/1000]	" you wanna go back to the dorm ? we can hang out there . i want to spend more time with you . " " yeah . is n't this summer my fault ? i really ca n't
[217/1000]	" there 's that , " a familiar voice said . " well yeah " came a voice . " what 's the problem now ? " it was hard to find a name for her friend .
[218/1000]	she started a fire and put a little kindling inside to cook while she helped herself to more coffee . she paused in the middle of stirring the oatmeal to watch the woman in the kitchen , who had come
[219/1000]	" of course , i do , " she said . " thanks for looking out for me . " " you 're welcome . anything you need , you tell me . just do n't wear yourself out
[220/1000]	as he started to walk away again . " i 'm coming , " mr. crepsley announced , " and since it will be this cold morning , i 'll have you hot . " " cool , "
[221/1000]	all at once , the entire congregation surged forward , so close that they rammed into one another , knocking over a few of the seats , knocking over a couple of tables of food . all around , the
[222/1000]	i found the picture , the one taken by my parents when i was sleeping in my bed . " you know , " i said to her over my shoulder . " you 're a good judge of
[223/1000]	she reached to stroke the hair away from his face , her heart thudding in her chest . " that you 'd want to change that was the first thing that came to mind . as soon as we had
[224/1000]	if he 'd come to the end of the aisle , he would have been the first to be on set . he stepped toward the front of everyone , toward the curtain that would close the door and shut
[225/1000]	" yes , " she whispered , a tear sliding down her cheek , " why is that ? " " well , it happens a lot . " i sighed . " when you have children ...
[226/1000]	" i always thought i was the one , " alice muttered . her tongue flicked out and traced the outer rim of her mouth . " who were you with before ? " " i do n't
[227/1000]	" what 's the matter ? " she asked . " i 'm - i 'm not feeling very well . " it was a lie , but it fell flat when she looked up . her eyes
[228/1000]	" to where ? " " to al t dorf . " the monk let the question stand , plainly deciding . as they both knew it was the absolute truth . so what was up ?
[229/1000]	" sorry if i 'm going to be a bastard to you , but i 'm just exhausted . who knows what this kid did in the last weeks ? " he gestured back and forth between them .
[230/1000]	" i meant my love for you . there 's time . i 've seen you through the darkness . " his hand went to her chin . the way she looked , how her eyes glimmered , her
[231/1000]	" we 're going back to the school , " she told me . " this time ? why ? " i did n't think she 'd be able to go back there now , if there was just
[232/1000]	" no , i 'm not , " he said , then took another bite and looked around . it was a good thing it was n't a very big room , because he never would have been able to
[233/1000]	" it 's just that - " " no buts ! " " it 's only fair though . we can wait . after all , i 'm only a child . " i paused for a
[234/1000]	he shrugged , then bent to pick up his pack . " i have my own , thank you . " " did you enjoy your stay ? " " yes . " " i 'm glad
[235/1000]	to this day , she has no idea who he is and what he is doing . the world , in fact , is mostly made up . where she 'd once known the author of the novel , she
[236/1000]	that did n't stop him from having the worst timing an eighteen year old boy could have . it took him even longer than i thought it would . by the time he took the picture , the woman he
[237/1000]	" how do i get to the house ? " " let me park . " i held up my thumb . he threw a twenty on the seat across from me . " that way to the
[238/1000]	" oh , come on . just ... do n't get all worked up over the possibility . " " yes , there is something i should show you , " he said , standing and making his way
[239/1000]	" why did you want a wife ? " " the house used to be mine , " thomas said . " oh , i 'm sorry , thomas . i did n't mean to pry . "
[240/1000]	nick frowned . " what ? " " nick , you mentioned your wife for how long ? " " oh . " what she said was probably meant as an effort to get his attention
[241/1000]	" no . you are not going off half - cocked . you need to take that whole story in your head , my friend . you see this is the reason why i married you . " mike was
[242/1000]	and damn it , i did the right thing by making him lose his shit . " come on , jeff . i know what i did was wrong , and i 'm sorry . she was probably pissed
[243/1000]	" <EOS> god 's eyes and mine . " you 're a vampire and i 'm a werewolf . you 're a werewolf , " i told him . his mouth twitched with a smile , which
[244/1000]	" i have n't . i 'm here now . " we had n't found the answer we were looking for , but we were going to find it . so we were going to solve all the questions .
[245/1000]	jack smiled . they walked down the passage for a short distance . jack glanced over his shoulder and saw jack watching and waiting . jack looked around ; it was quieter and quieter than at the station
[246/1000]	" is n't it a little late for that ? " " i 'm sorry , darling . actually , i would n't mind doing it myself . " caroline nodded to the car parked on the opposite side
[247/1000]	" you 're in shock , " i tease , taking her words at face value , which makes me wonder what she would hear from me if i told her the truth about my condition . " i
[248/1000]	" i do n't know just yet , " he admits sadly . " but i 'll figure it out . " i do n't look down at the car 's speedometer , but i can tell by the
[249/1000]	" is she going as well ? is it true ? " inquired brother george . " he needs a new body , " replied the girl . " is it true that the soul of sister magdalene
[250/1000]	" it was a close one . " " so you 're okay ? " " i 'm fine . " " are you sure ? do you need me to ... i mean , are you
[251/1000]	he had lost not one , but two hearts before he had realized just how precious they really were . i could feel his heart beating , matching the rhythm of mine . he loved me . he loved our
[252/1000]	it was then that there was a slight creaking of floorboards . the door creaked open . jack 's head popped out , eyes sparkling . ' who are you ? ' he cried . ' where are you
[253/1000]	he walked over to the closet again and opened the closet door . she could n't believe how easily he 'd made her lose her attention ! she wanted to laugh or cry , but she was too caught up
[254/1000]	" you too , " she said , but her gaze was on the window , her gaze full of silent pain as if a ghost were fighting in her and she knew who 'd brought her there .
[255/1000]	" what ? " john whispered . " are you saying it 's better ? or someone else has to go and change a bunch of stuff ? " " not me . i 'm going . "
[256/1000]	' just do n't make any more fuss with her , i do n't like it , ' he told her . ' that 's the trouble with you , david . you always want to know what 's
[257/1000]	" wait a minute ! " shouted david . " do you want to check on that little girl ? the children here do n't want her to come . the people here wo n't let anyone take her .
[258/1000]	his friends stared at my face , then looked down . " not tonight , " mr. solomon whispered . he dropped his hand from my stomach , and i felt the need to apologize . i said ,
[259/1000]	" my dad might n't know what to do if he starts to feel sorry for himself , " she replied , her expression serious as she glanced up at his face . " that might be good knowledge that
[260/1000]	' i do n't want to be married to a man who looks like me , ' she said . ' i do n't even know him . ' ' what makes you think you 'll have to get
[261/1000]	" are you hungry ? " he asked . " no , " she answered . " i 've just had enough . " " i meant , do you feel tired ? too tired to stand ,
[262/1000]	" nothing . " i looked away . if he was here , i would n't have to go through all this . i would n't have to go through pain to get through to him . no .
[263/1000]	the doctor came , the doctor helped dr. hunter , and the two stood close together . doctor hunter tried hard not to look at his friend 's injuries , after all , they were not particularly bad . the
[264/1000]	" you look different . it must be the sun . " he reached down to brush the tip of his finger over her lips . " that 's like heaven . " he reached up and kissed her nose
[265/1000]	" you do not ? " my heart was racing way too fast . " you will join me , " he said , leaning against the wall of the shower . my insides were pulsing with a desire
[266/1000]	" and what if nothing is , but what will be is gone ? " " then as people see , love is the beauty it is , not the curse . " " good luck . "
[267/1000]	" oh , i 'm a woman , " he lied . her eyes filled with tears . " do n't be too nice to me . i 'm sick of it . " she turned and walked away
[268/1000]	" i told you that we were done being like we were when we first went out . i told you that i was done being like you , and do n't you forget it . i do n't use
[269/1000]	" yeah <EOS> , well , you do n't buy my business . " she smiled , " i have a few more tricks a little to get the job handled to get it in motion . "
[270/1000]	that could wait until another time . i thought about something else . " i had an idea in mind what you like to do in your free time . " " shoot . " " i want
[271/1000]	" it feels good to be home , " he blurted <EOS> one , to do something every night . " just being out ... i know he 's never needed that . i love the feeling of how easy
[272/1000]	" why would anyone want this ? this is n't a book . " " well there 's been someone out looking for this and <EOS> and now they got it . " " they 'll find it
[273/1000]	" get away from her . do n't touch her . " " that 's not my fault . " jake shot him an angry look . " you do n't know that . " " she
[274/1000]	" not only my mind . it 's the whole f * * king world . i have - she had all the guys i 've been with . i never paid attention ! she 's the only one ,
[275/1000]	a slight breeze played through the trees , carrying away the scent of flowers and flowers . he saw the familiar stone fountain , the house across the plaza . now , there were more familiar landmarks :
[276/1000]	" what are we going to do ? " " i do n't know yet . i thought we 'd go shopping first . " i looked to the nightstand for my mobile phone . it was n't there
[277/1000]	" so we know not only what you are , but how you speak . is this part of your job ? " " no , it is not . no - one here is as useful to me
[278/1000]	" nothing . and no , my lady , " the footman assured her . " do let us know if there would be any further inquiries . " " thank you , " temperance said with a faint
[279/1000]	" you 're getting married , right ? " he said , as though she were n't standing right in front of a mirror naked . " yes . " " so you really were so miserable in
[280/1000]	" i did . " " good . " she 'd been right about that . he found peace in the quiet of his family . " i have to pee , " he told her .
[281/1000]	" of course you do n't , " the voice replied . " you would never fool me and do n't think you can . " he suddenly jumped to his feet . " what do you want ?
[282/1000]	' what kind of job is that ? ' mrs daniels was now quite angry at the man . ' what you do is as difficult to decide as i am . there is a limited staff in the
[283/1000]	" it did n't occur to you that something went wrong ? " he asked . his voice sounded incredulous . " we told you - " " i thought they could help us track those guys down ,
[284/1000]	" what did your brother do ? " " it 's a long story . i 'll tell you about it sometime , and then you 'll have a chance to sit down . " the man 's
[285/1000]	" how do you know him ? " i asked as i began walking out the door . she winked . " because , he is my ex - boyfriend . " i frowned . " oh
[286/1000]	" i 'm really sorry . " she pushed the screen door open wider , and a gust of fresh - air and scent of summer hit her . " sorry ? you 're the one who wants to
[287/1000]	" i find it odd you 'd still want to be with me if you do n't really understand the process , but i love it when you 're here with me and i know it 's all there for
[288/1000]	she did n't trust her own voice to speak ; she 'd never been drunk before . she felt lightheaded and nauseous , and felt as if her insides were turning to porridge . but there was one more fact
[289/1000]	" come on , you two , you can make this fun , " the big man said , and pulled open the door of a four - poster queen anne bed on the other side of the room .
[290/1000]	he took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst . it had to be this way , he thought , with every ounce of his strength . the others could n't help him . he 'd been promised
[291/1000]	" yes , my lady ? " she asked . " please go for your ride . have the driver drop me off at the stables . do n't worry about anything . do n't worry about anything in
[292/1000]	maybe she wanted us to be friends , but she 'd never admit it . and here we were , right at the bottom of the mountain , with our backs to each other , staring down the mountain in
[293/1000]	" like , a doctor , for example ? " " i do n't know about a doctor . " " well , you 'll know about one when you meet one . " " i certainly
[294/1000]	" well , this is something i 'd like to have on my calendar , " she said as she pulled the calendar out of her bag . " just so you get my notice , it 's all i
[295/1000]	his face tensed . " i - um - i thought you were at the bar , " she babbled , knowing there was no way to explain things even if she did understand them , or if she
[296/1000]	the two of them left the church for the bus . they did n't really have to go far ; they could actually live together ; and both had a really good lunch in an old diner outside of portland
[297/1000]	* * * i 'm having dinner with a number of people , each working or contributing time to the project . when the time comes , i 'm sure i wo n't be the only one . i
[298/1000]	" that makes no difference . my past relationship with her is very complicated and with the people i love even more , there 's no way i will make my marriage work . " " you two are
[299/1000]	" i do n't want to ruin your saturday , " he said playfully , bending out of the breeze so he could kiss the inside of her wrist . he smiled as he looked at her . "
[300/1000]	' do come on , ' she said . ' let 's get to the end of the hallway where we can talk to mrs jer my n - lloyd . ' they hurried down into darkness . sarah
[301/1000]	" i got shit to do , dad . " dad replies . i follow him out i grab some coffee , then we head away from my house so we can drive the rest of the way . when
[302/1000]	" it is as i had hoped . there is no need to disturb the peace of my palace in your absence . surely you would be willing to have me present from time to time , while you are
[303/1000]	" thank you , " she said , her voice muffled against his chest . he did n't move . he just held her . " i 'm sorry that you could n't see me , " lexi
[304/1000]	' oh , no , they ca n't , ' he said , as if shocked . ' they 're the ones who should be in real prison , not the ... that old bugger with the funny moustache .
[305/1000]	" can you make it up after the dinner and after my talk with sean ? " " i already wrote a few notes . " " okay , do that . i 'll call you . "
[306/1000]	he had a very close call . there were too many variables for him to relax or relax . the fact was he had not checked the time , or even if he had changed his cell number , he
[307/1000]	" there are other humans present , " she said thoughtfully . " i 'm amazed at how many humans have developed telepathy . it 's as if we belong to the earth like no other human , yet we
[308/1000]	" maybe there 's a way , " anna said softly . " what do you mean , anna ? " " you know the stories . about the wild west ? " bill was silent .
[309/1000]	he held his hand up to brace a jolt of electricity , and another wave streaked through his hand . they had to get around this . the power made a living , breathed , looked down on . the
[310/1000]	" i knew it . " " what are you talking about ? " " you were looking at my arm when we made love . " he grinned , looking down at it . " you said
[311/1000]	" oh , i see , i see , " the woman replied . " and this is a very important company , " she continued . " i do n't want me to be difficult , "
[312/1000]	" yeah , it was just a weird morning . and you 're not lying , you know ? i , um ... wish i 'd known , but then it would've made everything easier for me ... for both
[313/1000]	" it 's not bad , really . " he shrugged . " just be patient . " the man said something more and left , which prompted my dad to pull off my gloves , which he then
[314/1000]	" you 're welcome . " " just so we 're clear . no partying , or i 'll kick your ass . understood ? " " i get it . " but her temper was fraying the
[315/1000]	when we entered the living room , it was still dark . " dad ! " he sighed as he leaned back against the couch . " yeah ? " i walked back to the dining room table
[316/1000]	it dawned on me with a sudden shock . if we could get all the weapons out and then send them flying , i 'd be better off with the guns . we could build a little more wall .
[317/1000]	she ran her fingers beneath it , spreading the sticky fluid across her fingers . ' it was beautiful ! ' she marvel led at the simple perfection of the red and green butterfly . ' what ?
[318/1000]	i 'm having a hard time getting up out of bed , fighting to keep from falling over . i turn on my side and press my cheek to my pillow a few seconds before falling back . twenty
[319/1000]	' there is so much i would like to tell you but tonight belongs to you . you were right , ' she says as she turns back to me . ' i 'm sorry i did n't tell you
[320/1000]	but the three men were both so dead , except for the silver metal rings that linked them . a knife protruded through the middle man 's chest , but it was hardly worth thinking about . " what the
[321/1000]	' now ! ' it was all she could do . a shadow fell across the wall , and then another . a large shape materialized , and the door to lord vetinari 's chamber opened without a sound
[322/1000]	the following morning , joe found joe a big grin on his face . he was grinning like a schoolboy . something must have been up , joe thought . he joined him and after a few moments of pleasantries
[323/1000]	" is there something you wish to tell me , and why you are n't calling the cops yourself ? i was kind of hoping we could go have a little chat . maybe then i can come over .
[324/1000]	" i 'll get my own clothes , " i say . before i can say another word , he heads back into the kitchen . after a moment of silence , i follow after him and watch him do
[325/1000]	" wow ! " she cried , her high voice echoing in the chamber . " do you think we could see our own dead ? " " no , the light does n't hurt us , " i
[326/1000]	she smiled at a passing man and said , " you have to remember that i said that i 'd be in venice if you took me on your ship . did n't take me on , said the captain
[327/1000]	" i do n't know . i think about him every day , like a prisoner or whatever , trying to work this place out of my head . every time a door opens , i imagine the man to
[328/1000]	but if i am dreaming about a man , then it is n't a dream . " " does this mean any harm ? " she asked coyly , wanting to push his limits . the problem was
[329/1000]	" please make this easy on yourself , sarah . please . you know you can tell me anything . " i opened my mouth to tell him that i was going to lie down or do whatever was
[330/1000]	the small room was painted a dark , damp shade , but it was n't the dark shade that was troubling me . it was the way that it felt , the silence around me so thick that i was
[331/1000]	the door behind me slammed open and i stiffened quickly , almost dropping my glass of water when i saw a face looking over the railing . mr. scott was standing there , looking at me with a blank expression
[332/1000]	" just try it on for size , " she said . alex knew he was going to be a little tired because he 'd been getting up way too early for his job but he did it anyway
[333/1000]	the waitress brought dinner and jake took it back to the table . he opened up the tab on his coke , drank half the thing , and set it aside . " here . " he shoved the bill
[334/1000]	" just do it . " he did . they reached their beds and he pressed the alarm button next to his bed . " when did you start doing that ? " she asked , smiling .
[335/1000]	a second later , he heard a loud thump . as he jumped to his feet , the guard was still on the ground behind him , his finger still on the trigger . " stay where you
[336/1000]	" so what 's a date ? " she leaned back against the pillows beside him . " how can we call your ex - girlfriend - <EOS> like she 's my ex ? " " we can do
[337/1000]	i pushed the button toward top and it slid back to the carpet . " did n't you say there was a possibility that we 're supposed to get married today ? " luke asked . " i
[338/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i asked , finally . i felt hot inside , the burning growing worse . " i do n't know , " she said . " in the movies , they always
[339/1000]	" you 'll be careful ? " " no . i 'll be prepared . " he shook his head . " i ca n't believe you 're offering today , but it 's going to look bad
[340/1000]	" yes , " he said . " it will do . " he was n't surprised that the image of her , the last time he had seen her , was suddenly in his mind ; the beauty and
[341/1000]	" what the hell is going on ? " the voice sounded like one of my friends , but i did n't see them . i glanced at the wall . something was blocking the view . the mirror
[342/1000]	" who is it ? " she asked , her voice going deeper . " just your uncle , uncle max . " i held out an envelope . " i got you one . " she took
[343/1000]	" yes , we did . i was there all night . i 've seen the way the men look at one another for hours , and the jealousy 's unbearable . this one woman has bewitched him , and
[344/1000]	some in the class nodded - a few looked curious or even curious as to why my eyes were glued on their lecturer . they studied him attentively , before turning away and coming right back to me .
[345/1000]	before she could decide whether that might be a better or better idea , she took another step back . there was no need now for her to retreat . not until he 'd made his decision on the park
[346/1000]	her eyes darted back and forth between the two of us and i could tell she wanted to say something to me , but it did n't seem likely she would get a clear answer . then she turned her
[347/1000]	" very ... " a glance down the hallway revealed a woman , dressed in black as her clothing was , sitting in one of the corners with a small , young child by her side . the kid
[348/1000]	then he moved . another one of those black , leathery . i just wanted to get the hell away from him , but it obviously would n't do any good . i thought about the people being caught before
[349/1000]	" oh yes , my love , that 's perfect ! " i felt him kissing the top of my head as we walked to the store . " i 'm not a baby - killer baby -
[350/1000]	" of course you can , " he said . " besides , i was n't coming in there to get you ; even if i had , you know how disappointed i am about that . " he
[351/1000]	one day , i 'd be able to walk down a long tunnel and find her . somehow . that thought scared me . i did n't trust her . after a while , i stopped thinking of the tunnel
[352/1000]	as the rain picked up a notch , the two men in front of the road began to raise their oars . they started forward again , on the main route to the forest . the road was not a
[353/1000]	" just think about that , dear boy , " aunt pol told him . " if you succeed in obtaining more information , you 'll be able to pass that on to the others . they 're quite well
[354/1000]	" i did n't , " i insisted , and then my mind came back to me . " wait , i did n't take my own pills ? " " what ? oh . my . gosh .
[355/1000]	" would you leave a note for my doctor ? " james asked , his tone curious as he sat down . " the one i left with my mother . " she glanced at her notes . "
[356/1000]	she put her head down again and muttered something . " no , i ca n't . so do n't . i have to learn to trust everyone else . " " but - " " let me
[357/1000]	" he 'll die soon , anyway , " i said . " but you wo n't have to , " said my ex - friend . " you wo n't have to see him die . "
[358/1000]	one of the first things about him had been the way he had walked with her in that club . all those intense emotions ... it still haunted her , but at least he had n't left her alone .
[359/1000]	" yeah , he 's never done that before . " " damn , " i said . " how long have you known him , rob ? " " since september , sophomore year . he graduated
[360/1000]	" what happened to them ? " " the pack kidnapped my husband and was about to take him away from me . they wanted to tell everyone about him , so i let them go through the whole
[361/1000]	i shake my head . " i 'll tell her everything before i go . trust me . i 'll see her soon . " she nods and turns to leave . i grab her arm . " come
[362/1000]	" so ? " " no , you wanted to make amends for earlier . does that mean you 'd like to make it to the bar on friday night ? " " yeah . that 'd be
[363/1000]	" who does he always bring with him ? " " i do n't know , but he does the best he can . you can be my best man . " " i 'm afraid i do
[364/1000]	but the question remained ; why ? was the answer not obvious ? but , that did not concern him , at least not in the least . the answer was obvious ; it was his own anger -
[365/1000]	" i do n't understand , " said the woman . " explain . just understand your fear . " " fear ? " murmured sheerin . " the fear of what ? " but it was too
[366/1000]	he had a long line of police officers in front of him . she thought she had seen more officers during the last couple of years than she had in a lifetime by her best description . there was
[367/1000]	" i think you got it , sugar . you wanna come here ? " " i love you , dad , but i think my family 's been on a little shit lately . this is not the
[368/1000]	she opened her mouth to say something about her lack of desire for him , but suddenly there was the sound of a door opening . she knew the sound of a key turning in the lock , and knew
[369/1000]	" but no , no , " she said . " i ... no . i think not . i think ... no , i 'm not sure . the answer is , yes . i 've known for some
[370/1000]	" are you sure ? " she looked at him , her green eyes luminous within the darkness of her robe . " your words are making me sleepy . let me rest a minute . " he
[371/1000]	i took this as a good sign and slipped the sword within arm 's reach , waiting silently as the three of them were introduced . the first vampire was a little shorter than the other two , with sandy
[372/1000]	' who ? ' said carrot . ' we talked about this , i thought ... yeah . you 've been here for a long time , carrot . you know the story . it 's about the king .
[373/1000]	as he reached out to finish a moment after my fingers crossed his to take in the action , his fingers grazed against mine , causing my stomach to dip . " <EOS> an idiot , " he whispered
[374/1000]	the other man looked at her in horror and asked with a wild , desperate look , " may i serve if you will allow me to assist you ? " she frowned at him , said she ,
[375/1000]	as she started to turn , he snaked out and clamped the cuffs about her aching wrists . " you 're giving as good as you get . " then he gave her a sensual smile that nearly made
[376/1000]	" the doctor suggested that i need " - he glanced up to the ceiling - " a shower . " " oh , god . " " i 'm sure you do . i was there when
[377/1000]	* * * * * an hour later , at the school 's auditorium , everyone was in place for the play ; my favorite part of the day . even the drama scene was already under way -
[378/1000]	but he could n't sit still , and i was afraid he 'd take off in that way again and see that little baby with all that shiny blue hair , and what a small wonder - if he carried
[379/1000]	the elevator was coming through the lobby . the doors had been closed . i sat down again . " if this really was the united states , someone is going to have to give the police an explanation
[380/1000]	if you 'd been so kind as to describe him , i would've been inclined to laugh . his eyes were the color of green eggs and his hair was a dark brown rather than light blond . his lips
[381/1000]	as i spoke i held my hands up high in a v - shape and lifted my hands to the sky . it was a silly thing to do when there were no guns , shotguns , or even handguns
[382/1000]	" she may have a point , " he said , rubbing his forehead . " i 'm not doing it for either of us . i 'm there to help . i 'd never do anything i thought
[383/1000]	you 're losing your heart . there is no other way . you are no one . this is the end of it . your journey will be a war of words . end or - the
[384/1000]	she sat up . " why were you at the end of the hall ? " i gave her a confused look . " we were about to meet daniel . we do n't have time to go sit
[385/1000]	" this house could be the exception , " says steve , and he nods his head in agreement , " but people change . " mike pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket . " and like
[386/1000]	" i 'm surprised you remember the names of your parents , " he observed , as he stepped closer to the table . " that 's strange , from the way they are on their side of the table
[387/1000]	he did n't want their friendship destroyed , either . with that thought , he slid his hand to the nape of her neck again , tugged her head down so that their lips brushed . at this close range
[388/1000]	" no , i meant <EOS> something more . i was afraid it might not be the best thing for us . " " you did n't say that earlier , " i protested . " if i
[389/1000]	" he 'll give you a bonus if you start watching the other ones . no hard feelin 's , " said joe . " but you 're not allowed to give me anymore candy , " said willy
[390/1000]	it was an all in one and now i wanted us to be a family . " no ! " i ran forward , desperate to make him understand . " ryder , we 're going to
[391/1000]	" no , absolutely not ! " i say , trying to get out of the house . " you guys get off each other 's backs for one night tonight . leave nash alone until tomorrow . he 's
[392/1000]	his name made my back arch . " you can call me jax . jax , please call me jax . " he stared at me until i felt heat creep into my cheeks . when he released me
[393/1000]	" i 'm sure they did n't say that . " " i did n't ask . " i sat up . " i 'm going to work on getting them to agree . " " how ?
[394/1000]	the little boy shook his head and laughed . " good lad , " said sir gilbert , " you are no longer a boy at all , in fact , if you are a boy at all ,
[395/1000]	" yes , " she answered softly . i pressed , so pressed <EOS> when she sucked <EOS> - that , before bed , i made the rug ( " i could hide , then wash everything ,
[396/1000]	i 'd have to say that the whole thing was a little bizarre . there were two choices , and they were both equally terrifying , but the third made me feel happy to find answers . " this
[397/1000]	" hey , guys ? " dylan 's voice carried on the cool breeze , making her gasp beneath it . they turned and he was running after them , the sound of his sneakers clicking quickly across the
[398/1000]	" just some guy we 've met , " i said . " all i know is he worked the area over the summer , and he and i have been spending some quality time together . " "
[399/1000]	" you knew last night , did n't you ? " i nodded . " i was right there , waiting for you . " " you need to leave , " he said . " maybe you
[400/1000]	if he loved her . all the time he loved her , you knew that was false . the truth was that he was going to be with her for the rest of his life , and he was willing
[401/1000]	the dark warrior , who had been at the gates , did not look at them . he simply stood , staring at them . there was a growing light in his eyes , that made arya afraid for
[402/1000]	my heart is n't in it . part of me is shocked that we 've been able to stand in this spot to deal with the man that made me a part - time prostitute . but , that part
[403/1000]	" this is a bad time and place to talk about this . i know you need help . you 've been crying . what is that you 're thinking ? " he stared straight ahead . " i
[404/1000]	he dropped his arms to his sides . " if i had seen up close that you were ... " without me having to finish , she reached for the buttons at his collar , one by one ,
[405/1000]	the light went out of the tunnel , and i moved cautiously to the side , careful not to step in any blood . there were no signs of its passage either , and neither was the heavy door .
[406/1000]	i did n't really want to die , but i knew i had to play it smart and pretend i had a viable family if <EOS> - ever , for all like someone with all my old pals .
[407/1000]	please come . come . " i shook my head , trying to get them to understand what we were doing . " i ca n't go back there . " they stared at me , their expressions
[408/1000]	i looked around . it looked so dark in here . even the shadows moved and moved . nothing happened . " i 've come to take you to my room , " he said , ignoring my other
[409/1000]	" you 're a good man , logan . you 'll never have to worry about me , " she said softly . " i swear i wo n't survive this . you ca n't take it away from me
[410/1000]	his gaze moved to her stomach . " how 's it feel ? " her stomach rumbled , but she could n't help noticing the pain was gone ... literally at least . no swelling , no bleeding ,
[411/1000]	" that ca n't be so , " he said . " it is , " she said . he noticed she was holding her crucifix in her right hand , and she was wearing the ring with the
[412/1000]	" i can . " he is one in one million . " then , please get me to a starbucks so i can fix this for you . " " i just have to take a blood
[413/1000]	but he did . " i 'm sorry baby , but i do n't think you need me right now . but in the meantime , if it would n't have been for your mom , i would have
[414/1000]	she waited for me to finish my line , looking like a little girl who had finally caught her dad dies tickling her . then she sat back and smiled . and for a moment , i thought it
[415/1000]	" you wo n't tell anyone about what happened with your parents ? and about me ? " " i would n't if i thought you would be okay with it . besides , " she said with a
[416/1000]	" thank you , " i reply , suddenly uncomfortable , but grateful . " you 're welcome , sweetheart , " he smiles widely . " how much did he give you to drink , and how
[417/1000]	i can see the moment when he realizes the consequences . the muscles in his jaw fle xes like he 's trying not to smile . " you will never want for anything , and i would let you
[418/1000]	the king of adar lan bowed . his face was the epitome of formality , and chaol could n't help feeling sorry for him . " i 'm glad to see it worked out , your grace . "
[419/1000]	" what about you , sir ? " " i 'll go to the nearest town , stay in shelter for a spell , then i 'll visit the church and maybe come back . " " yes
[420/1000]	the word ' angel ' fell across my mind and i was reminded that it could be a man . " what ? what the hell are you talking about ? " i was shocked my voice was even
[421/1000]	the phone rang . <EOS> only seconds later she heard him say that he was out the door . a moment later a long , low whistle escaped from above . she could n't imagine what would make a man
[422/1000]	" one hundred and fifty - six hundred seventy - eight , " the bartender said . " that 's eighty - one hundred fifty . fifty - four . " " three hundred twenty - six , "
[423/1000]	he took a deep , shuddering breath for strength . he was going to have to do what she said next . " i love my mom . " her voice shook . " i got ta love her
[424/1000]	" what ? " a gentle hand gripped his arm . " something the family has n't told you . things that happened before you did . " " what is it ? " " that 's
[425/1000]	" is he always like this ? " " no , i make his blood pressure and his brain burn up at the same time , it 's because he 's a lot of fun , and he 's
[426/1000]	" are you all right ? was it too rough ? " she shook her head quickly . " no , it was wonderful , " she cried , hugging him in a tight hug . " thank you
[427/1000]	" i used to be an alchemist . now i 'm just a gypsy and a girl . nobody , i mean never mind that , will ever know just what i 've done ... " he cleared his throat
[428/1000]	" not just on your life ? " " i never did that ! not once , and certainly not with you ! " i could n't believe that i 'd been so stupid . how would evan do
[429/1000]	" my god , this feels like deja vu , " i said . i raised my sunglasses as i set the glass down on the passenger seat . " this is where you were born . " i
[430/1000]	and , that night , he was in his apartment , staring into the darkness , wondering why he was so scared . five years later , he still did n't trust that he could make things right .
[431/1000]	" is it safe ? " she nods , biting her lower lip as the tears start to trickle down her cheeks . " what are we going to do ? " i 'm on a roll .
[432/1000]	" do you think he 's going to show up today ? " " you 're sure ? " " i 'm sure . that 's what i mean . what i 'm worried about is if he
[433/1000]	but then the door to gray 's brother 's room opened . it was always closed during the day , even to strangers . gray always wanted to be able to see up to it . a sense of trust
[434/1000]	" i ... i 'm so sorry for that . " at first , his eyes opened up wide , and his jaw tightened as if he were about to say something . " i do n't want to
[435/1000]	i leaned in again and whispered , " that is n't what we are . " " he 's an old man , " she muttered back . " not like an older man , " i replied
[436/1000]	i sat in an angry silence for a few minutes while my mind weighed over the events of the last few nights . who was killing innocent people , and why ? this was n't random . this was
[437/1000]	i 'm being held captive , and i 'm not sure i 'm ready for it . " no wonder they thought i was a runaway ... it 's the only explanation . " i do n't believe
[438/1000]	" how 's everyone ? " he was n't worried . he stared at me expectantly . i shrugged . " almost done with the story . " sean reached out and squeezed my arm . " '
[439/1000]	" so , then , what do you recommend ? " i said . " like taking on the world ? " he seemed puzzled . " i 'm not sure why you 'd need it , " he
[440/1000]	" well , maybe i did . " and maybe you did not just break the rules , he thought . then he saw a tall figure striding toward him and it was him and it was he
[441/1000]	after i ate , i took a shower , then crawled underneath the covers , closed my eyes , and tried to get some sleep . eventually i dozed off , and the next time i woke i had the
[442/1000]	" what 's to stop me and my guys from breaking it in later ? " " we 'll get you some plastic bag for the body . " the doctor went back to his examination of the
[443/1000]	" yes . " " and he called me today , but i had to work . " " he called you ? " " he said there was something going on . something big and he
[444/1000]	he nodded . " me either . but that was one of the best nights of my life tonight - all week ... since i arrived . " amery let out a lazy sigh as she pressed her mouth
[445/1000]	" what are you still doing here ? " " what do you mean ? i guess i needed to come visit you , to let you know it 's not your fault . " he sat down
[446/1000]	john and charlie were to do everything in their power to keep the drug users and others from helping . by the end of july , john walked into town that saturday , walked through the front doors of the
[447/1000]	" you and the big big oaf . " " good . " " it 's a good thing we 're not here , at least not at the moment . the trouble he may have and the ways
[448/1000]	she took off in a quick sprint , running <EOS> but then she paced it and ate , smiling when she would take the one when we were in her hair . what was her favorite , how did she

[450/1000]	once he was in a private room , he paced the floor . not the most con genial of accommodations for a man , but he was used to it . " how long will she be asleep ?
[451/1000]	yes , she was a fighter - but they had both accepted it so easily . she 'd never had a real reason to be afraid of sex . sure , she 'd given herself up to sex plenty

[455/1000]	she stared at him . he sat up , groaning as though his legs had gone tired . " sorry ... " " i asked you first . i 'll leave you alone if you do n't wanna
[456/1000]	she had spent fifteen months as a slave to the master , then , and she had been rewarded with a slave . the rest had been a quiet and unassuming life . so why did she feel
[457/1000]	and to this day , i can not go through that again . he was a true patriot during his time on the army and soldiers fighting for him , being a lieutenant - colonel all those years ago .
[458/1000]	he was gone . my eyes flew open and my head flew back . shit . i started to get out of bed . something was wrong . a good wrong , a wrong wrong .
[459/1000]	the other two members of the white house staff had done the same - with their boss . " have you and the president considered a change of hands ? i can have my guys drop off this book today
[460/1000]	so what was our point ? i 'd gotten laid twice and nothing had happened . " no . nothing . " " do you want to go for a car trip after school ? " i laughed
[461/1000]	" no , but we 're not going away to be replaced again , " said the scientist . " is n't that why we came here ? " " yes , but we 're not a race of
[462/1000]	he nodded , watching the clouds . " yes . there are three thousand men out there , the rest are just sitting around in the rain . " " they should n't be , " she said .
[463/1000]	he did n't know . had there been a mistake ? a glitch ? one last , agonizing minute ? he 'd already committed to memory every single detail of yesterday 's events , every breath he 'd taken
[464/1000]	" like the way i said this first night , i 've always heard what a dangerous and dangerous woman you are . but that first night - " " i did n't seduce her , " i shot
[465/1000]	then she was inside him ... again . then he was over her , deep inside her , and he was shuddering as the waves of pleasure slammed through him , and maya clung to him because he was
[466/1000]	" <EOS> " " that is where you 're supposed to be . oh and so - but we have it on file that we 're moving there : my dad 's wife , mom , and - "
[467/1000]	a strange tingling started at her skin and traveled up her spine . it stopped on her shoulders and turned in her hair . like magic , her skin glowed . without thinking , a smile spread across her face
[468/1000]	" she 'd rather she keep you , " emily answered , holding out a huge smile for everyone - except me . damn it all to hell . emily did n't give a shit who got me pregnant .
[469/1000]	they fell into silence again , and by the time they reached the end of our journey , i wanted more than anything to ask him about his next mission to london . i wanted to talk about him .
[470/1000]	" you need me ? " she demanded . " you want to run ? well , that 's fine . but you need to talk to ty , because not only am i driving you to him but
[471/1000]	he does n't need to . " you 've got ta be shitting me . " " i was thinking that the more we discussed the possible options , the more you 'd be able to tell me if
[472/1000]	" was i missing something ? " she asked . " you did not miss anything . " " oh . " " and why should i tell you if you did not care ? " said
[473/1000]	" nothing , " i whispered <EOS> a kiss that we did another time we did a bit in which then a short time later , more . that ended . " never . " he 'd told me
[474/1000]	" do they do that sort of thing on the second day of the war ? " sparhawk asked , looking around the room . " it 's a peculiar thing . " " people are always asking
[475/1000]	she smiled , but did n't answer . he did n't think she was angry with him - in fact it seemed she was smiling harder than ever ... ' my father kept watching me the whole time , '
[476/1000]	' well , i 'm not a very good cook and i do n't eat much but i do have a few good skills , yes ? ' ' what happened once you got home ? ' she interrupted
[477/1000]	" what ? " i blinked . he came closer and caught my face in his hands . " he told you that ? " i nodded as tears slipped down my cheeks . "
[478/1000]	i nodded once , even though i was n't sure what explanation i 'd get . " where are the guys ? " seth did n't stop pacing before answering . " you 're going to get out of

[480/1000]	" what we saw today was a battle , and you , the great lord , are the new lord . it is as if fate made you . " she does not have to mention who was responsible
[481/1000]	" how is izzy ? " " better . she likes traveling and has a few hours ' notice in a business that lets her travel all the time . " " what about eibhear ? she
[482/1000]	the one the rest had been waiting for , the one they had n't had the chance to fight , had just been taken , and that their fate was looking up . " how can i remember who
[483/1000]	she pushed at him . " i want to stay here . " " dammit , do n't push me too far into this . " he shifted , and there was a growl in his voice . "
[484/1000]	when they reached the gates , two guards stood in a half circle , staring up at them . another guard stood by a set of glass doors set in a thick wooden frame , and he stared at them
[485/1000]	by this time it would n't have mattered and there were plenty of other things to concentrate on . i found myself sitting in my car outside of the store where i found a job and moved out to the
[486/1000]	i guess there 's one more thing you never told me you know . like - like you really know better than i do . " " what the hell i know is that when i 'm with you
[487/1000]	" what do you want ? " " i want you to find out about this mr. le may guy . he is n't a nice guy . he was a nasty , evil man of a man .
[488/1000]	" of course not . i do n't expect anything . " " you got what you wanted , daddy . get out . " chapter 4 i could n't believe i was stuck at home sitting
[489/1000]	" we do n't have time for that . the guy is desperate . we need to do something to keep this guy at bay . you 're an agent . you know how to get answers . you know
[490/1000]	he had watched her at the hospital , watching in horror the first time he 'd seen her , unable to comprehend what had happened to her . he 'd tried , then had almost fallen in the lake around
[491/1000]	" now , " i said softly as we went to the car . looking at me , his blue eyes glittered . " now ? " he repeated , glancing down at my cleavage . " do you
[492/1000]	" oh , no ! " i cried . " i 'm sorry , that was rude - " " that 's not it ! " he said . " that 's never been done to me before .
[493/1000]	no reply . he bent to pick up the bottle and was surprised when he found that the cork had torn off , and he looked inside . what he saw was his own blood . behind him , he
[494/1000]	" i think you 're not as clueless as they say you are . " the idea of being called dumb seemed ridiculous . " it 's true that i feel incredibly stupid asking that of you ,
[495/1000]	the second man stared at him . the second smiled and said nothing . i could tell the men were intimidated by him , the only difference being that it was not really the same man . his face
[496/1000]	he 'd told her that she would be the one to feed his children and start a family so that she could save the world . which meant that he could think of no way of justi fying that he
[497/1000]	" there 's got to be a way to work that out with your mom , " i said . i tried to sound hopeful . " none . she 's in such a bad state . "
[498/1000]	" hey , " i said , forcing a small smile . without waiting for an explanation or acknowledgement , he jogged back to the house and hopped a fence . it did n't occur to him to duck
[499/1000]	" you sure ? " i ask . " it would've been nice if it were like in the old days . our mom would let us - " he cuts me off . " do n't you get it
[500/1000]	" stop it . " victoria shouted at him . " you 're making me jealous ! " she demanded . but it was n't just that he was making her jealous ; it was being with other men
[501/1000]	" what you do n't know is what makes you so deadly , " said the woman . " you 'll have the mark within seconds . i need you to be very specific in your answer . "
[502/1000]	" let 's just have a little fun this weekend . i 'll make up in a few . i need a good day to get back to my normal life . " " of course . i 've
[503/1000]	" of course . " he sat down beside her , then pulled her close . " did you ever , in a million years , think that i 'd hurt you ? " she pulled away , gave
[504/1000]	" you ? " i was confused . " yeah , you . what the f * * k does that mean ? " he knew my head game . " i 'm from a family of my
[505/1000]	" can i stop in at starbucks first ? i have a special request . " " no , we 've already covered all that . i ordered more coffees , like i always do . " i
[506/1000]	" are the children ok ? " i asked . " yes . let 's go eat and then go to a party . " len said . " not tonight ? " " i am glad
[507/1000]	" you 're the one who told me not to expect anything from him . when the shit hit the fan , well , you would've done the same thing after i got to your side . now , what
[508/1000]	he stared at my face . i could tell that he needed a minute , then he put his fingertips gently on my lower lip like he was caressing it . " what 's wrong ? " he asked .
[509/1000]	" so you 're not really a journalist , " he said when he handed the papers back toward me . " i 'm not . " " fine . " he pointed around the room and gave
[510/1000]	she had told him that she would be getting ready to face an early breakfast . they had shared a dinner together after breakfast . she had ordered a light , light breakfast not even four hours ago , and
[511/1000]	" in any case , " he murmured as he started up the elevator ahead of her , " just so you know , it wo n't happen again . " she laughed . " as the good doctor
[512/1000]	" what time did he come in ? " " about seven o'clock . " " i need to talk to him . maybe he knows when i 'll be back . " " he would n't
[513/1000]	" we have a meeting with our principal last minute , the one about us having a conversation , " jack said . " well , two meetings , actually . the one the sheriff has with the court order
[514/1000]	" come on , you 're getting fat . i never have anything to drink , and i know you love that glass . " " how do you know it 's not for me ? " "
[515/1000]	" if you do n't mind me sayin ' it though , mr. mackenzie , " he said , still smiling . " in what way are ye better off ? " " i 'll take full responsibility ,
[516/1000]	i found my backpack in the kitchen . it contained my computer and a pile of textbooks on history and physics . i could use my books to help me study , too , since i had a history final
[517/1000]	" the president will have a report soon . we must decide which way to go . " this request had been issued by the chief of staff , the senior officer , so what did it matter ? you
[518/1000]	" what are you doing ? " " i 'm leaving you some blood . i 'm going to need every drop . " " there is n't any . " but i had plenty . i licked
[519/1000]	" it 's like trying to pull fingernails off a chalkboard . we 're doing it all wrong . " " that 's my girl . " chase kissed the base of her throat and chuckled . " now
[520/1000]	" you do n't want us any more , and you do n't want some stranger to do your dirty work for you , like i did n't . you want your job , i can give it to you
[521/1000]	" you 're not so bad yourself , " he said with a laugh . " do n't flatter me . honestly , they sure do piss me off . " " i can tell . "
[522/1000]	she looked at me , brows knit . " what is it ? " that 's when i broke , or pretended i did . i threw my arms up and banged on the ceiling . " she came
[523/1000]	" i had a thing last night . he does have a nice backside . " i giggle . " you 're such an idiot . " " a very good one . i 'd like to show
[524/1000]	" no . " " how ? " " because i met you . " " how long ago ? " " two years . " " two years ? " and still he asked
[525/1000]	and that 's a promise . " can you please , um , stop getting off at the airport ? " i asked , trying to look desperate . " i bet i can , baby , "
[526/1000]	" that wo n't help you , " says the captain , looking with interest at the blood - soaked clothes . " i know that ! i know ! i just ... " " all right ,
[527/1000]	the world had gone dim , the lights to the cavern now a pale purple . the cave wall seemed to go up in smoke , until at last , nearly like a hole in the earth , a big
[528/1000]	" to kill me , " i said , my voice low and soft . " why ? " he asked . i did n't know how much i could tell him , whether i would ever be
[529/1000]	" the more i know about alex , the more i do n't believe it . he 's better than this , just as i know he 's strong . so if you give him a chance , you 'll
[530/1000]	" what 's her name so i can put you on my case ? " " the victim 's name is megan stewart . " " that 'll do it . " he smiled , " i
[531/1000]	<EOS> i 've met a lot of vampires . i 've picked up the habit of choosing a lot of vampires , because they do n't have to be a natural born monster and , as far as i 'm
[532/1000]	" we 'll meet in three hours , " he said , and i could hear the smile in his voice . the phone rang , and i pulled the receiver away from my ear , then stood ,
[533/1000]	" you must have been a great beauty . " the other two nodded , faces blank , like they were trying to remember where they were . " how long have you two been together ? "
[534/1000]	she saw the indecision and confusion in his eyes before he bit off his response . " i understand that you 're disappointed in me , haley , but you are a woman of your word and right now i
[535/1000]	" i 'll tell you a secret , " john 's voice says into my ear . i lift up my head , looking at him . " what 's the one thing you do n't know ? "
[536/1000]	i did n't realize how hungry i was . " i still ca n't believe you dragged me across texas . i thought i was going to die . how could you want to be here if it was
[537/1000]	on that i believed her , i do n't know if i really believed her , it was what all my parents would say to her . this did not keep me from thinking we should come back to the
[538/1000]	i was still sitting upon the bed , arms resting on my knees , and felt no less of a mess . why could n't he have chosen a little less casual - ish in his home ? i 'd
[539/1000]	where the fuck were we ? what was happening ? i swallowed hard , trying to focus and my senses were clear to the touch of his lips on my neck . he had a nice mouth . i
[540/1000]	" i 'm not as good as you . " and she 's quiet . i 'm waiting for what she 'll say next , but she does n't say anything . i try again . " you
[541/1000]	he seemed to be on the verge of tears , his speech barely above a whisper . " it was then that i fell under miss judith 's spell of enchantment , for no man could make his eyes leave
[542/1000]	" yeah , i can have four . " " yeah . " i pulled in an aggravated breath , as i watched him pull his cell out of his back pocket . " what 's wrong
[543/1000]	he shook his head again . " tell me what you know , " he said . reacher sat back and leaned forward , elbows on knees . " where else was there on friday ? "
[544/1000]	i tried not to think of how much i loved him . it had been so long since i was with someone ... other than ty , at least . every time ty got close to someone for long ,
[545/1000]	" did the boy in the hallway say anything ? " the man asked . " i have no idea , " ashe muttered . " and maybe if he said something specific , that might give us something
[546/1000]	" i 'm sure your parents would love to have you , even if you are not an assassin , which is a true possibility , but even so , they prefer to know you 're safe . " she
[547/1000]	" i just hope he has n't seen past this charade . he 's got her out of the apartment <EOS> - " there is a loud screech of the door . " stop him ! " my
[548/1000]	his answer makes my heart flutter . he takes a seat in the middle of the bed , and as i sit down beside him , he leans forward and whispers in my ear , " the words themselves
[549/1000]	her head was lowered and a shadow fell across her face . but her eyes still glittered with anger , just as they had since i 'd met her and had started to suspect something was wrong with her .
[550/1000]	" but what if it 's not them ? " i asked . there was another pause . " what then ? " " i mean , no one would pay my tuition or anything like that .
[551/1000]	as our mouths touched the edge of the tub , ty 's arms went around my hips and pulled me closer , letting himself melt into me . " i love you , " he whispered as his tongue darted
[552/1000]	he reached down , scooped her into his arms , and gave her a loving , loving kiss . " now let me kiss you , " he murmured against her lips . she turned her lips into
[553/1000]	on the sidewalk , sarah 's car pulled up , and a couple of people came out of their homes and walked toward her . sarah got out of her car and hugged her mom one last time before heading
[554/1000]	" you really ca n't think of the list of people you might remember ? " " no . a big number is a lot . we did n't get to much other than getting married . "
[555/1000]	" really ? then do n't get this . " i pointed to my shoulder . " i do n't give a shit about it right now . " he dropped both hands and looked down at his shoes
[556/1000]	" there 's a house in london called the royal british air ways . the name is on the entrance , but there 's no record of the last flight to geneva . but i have pictures and recordings .
[557/1000]	" ' not one to leave a hole for nobody , ' " he repeated . " very good . he 's always said that in the past . " " it means he 's a little scared ,
[558/1000]	" for what ? " my voice cracked . " for f * * k. for you . for whatever reasons , you need me , and because i need you i 'll always do whatever you want .
[559/1000]	a gust of wind blew in , raising the edge of a blanket of thick clouds over us . a few moments earlier , as i had prepared for the meeting , i had been so absorbed within my thoughts
[560/1000]	jake had no idea now that he was losing her . as much as he 'd wanted to leave all that behind , she 'd forced him into it . after all , the only reason he 'd come back
[561/1000]	" you did n't answer my question , " she said , her voice soft and full of vulnerability and affection . hell , he was n't sure how to reply . he did n't want to lie
[562/1000]	" my brother , father , father , father , " this time the voice was a deep old man 's . " they never did it , not really . i do it , i destroy . "
[563/1000]	" what the hell does that mean ? did you see something happen , or were you having a vision ? " " no , i just saw him grab a drink and then disappear . what did you
[564/1000]	" it was worth it , though , " i whispered . " they 're not supposed to call his girlfriend . " " you ca n't do that , " he said quietly . " you took his
[565/1000]	his gaze drops to where his jeans are buttoned at the waist . " i never did agree to that with you . " i force a smile . " i did n't expect you to . i thought
[566/1000]	" well , they are n't your parents , so you sure know how to act . they say that you are like your mother . " the first one i met , the one whose face did n't
[567/1000]	" when it came down to it it could be a disaster . if he dies by natural causes , then there will be nothing left to save him . " " how much do you want ? "
[568/1000]	" did you go a little crazy ? do n't see why . i 'm not some animal , you know . " " i was kidding , " i added , patting his thigh . " did you
[569/1000]	the guard glanced down to the floor , nodded at his companion , and started towards me . " wait . i 'm being followed , " the rogue said . " they 'll come after me . i
[570/1000]	" i could n't make him do anything . " " so you came back ? " i asked . " actually , i was at the shelter yesterday , looking for you . " " you
[571/1000]	he was about to answer when the waitress came by and placed some menus in front of them . she did n't ask questions and just left the room . " i usually keep a diary , " he
[572/1000]	but he could n't let the future be a reflection of that past with a child , could n't take that away from them . they should start now . he should have her in his bed yesterday morning
[573/1000]	she shrugged . " i hate to admit it , but you 're right . " he lifted his brows . " i know it 's petty , but even i know that a monster has to eat
[574/1000]	" it never hurts to practice . the people in the army call it a " time out from the war " and i 'm sure you know how that feels . " her eyes lingered at me for
[575/1000]	for a moment , he looked up , his expression inscrutable . his full lips were parted . he looked confused , as if he simply did n't understand how to respond to my question . then , his brow
[576/1000]	" never mind all this ! what was she saying ? " " oh ... " he shrugged . " she wanted to know where everyone was - where my parents were and who was at the house .
[577/1000]	" you 're too much . not all of us are ... " " you 're just looking out for each other , " i say , " and that includes me . " his face pinches up
[578/1000]	but he held on tight . his expression twisted with worry and anguish . something was not right . but , for now , there was none of that to be concerned about as he closed his eyes
[579/1000]	" what could she have said that made him think she 'd see me as some kind of rival . did he tell you ? " " no ... " she bit her tongue and chewed the inside of
[580/1000]	he looked down at the man 's fingers moving rhythmically on top of the wheel , feeling the muscles jerk and strain as the driver maneuvered over the speed bumps . " maybe we could cut back on the
[581/1000]	" it 's always an option , " said seldon , " but i do n't have my own two wishes . " humm in said , " yours is to be fulfilled and your soul is to be
[582/1000]	and i had to take three deep breaths to stop myself from feeling a silly grin cross my face . damn , my life was totally turning into a freaking roller coaster . then i remembered i was pregnant
[583/1000]	" and you ... what are you gon na do with your life ? " sarah asked him . i had asked her about that a handful of times today . " it 's taking two people , " she
[584/1000]	as he put it , he could n't get away from the idea that he had left a trail to follow until he really got his chance to go out on it . if someone was out there , he
[585/1000]	there was a moment of silence . then the first voice spoke . " is this the only piece of news i 'm going to hear ... other than my name and a few other things that can potentially
[586/1000]	" i 'm a nice guy , " said the boy . the boy raised his eyes to meet the sky but he too was staring . " nothing the matter ? " the boy returned his stare .
[587/1000]	* * * * * in his office , i pulled out my phone and hit the number my mother always used to call me when she was in trouble . i wished she would call me , but
[588/1000]	" that was ... i do n't know what you mean , " i admitted . " and did you like working with jared ? was he a good boss ? " " he was , " i
[589/1000]	" not yet . we were both drunk last night . " she swallowed back her own fear . she would not tell the man that once , she would be dead . " there 's more than
[590/1000]	he watched the ground fall away behind him . his mother 's heart did n't hurt like it had before and he could feel her presence radiating with warmth and happiness . his world crumbled around him and he
[591/1000]	" i want you to sit tight because while you 're in here doing your thing , we need to move you to a nice room . i 've talked to a detective about it as well and , if
[592/1000]	chapter 45 present day i get home on sunday afternoon . the morning had broken into two : the funeral and the funeral of the girl i 'd known . i spent the rest of the day cleaning
[593/1000]	at this point , i 'd started feeling a sharp pang of rage . " there 's something wrong with her mind . there are so many things wrong with her mind ! someone is going to turn her into
[594/1000]	i reached the end of the hall and walked down the stairs , listening for the front door to be thrown open . i put my body in readiness for his next words . " at least i did
[595/1000]	one of the two guards brought him to a cubicle opposite the room . while waiting for the man to finish what he was doing , terrance watched the guard leave . the other two guards exited , leaving him
[596/1000]	' he 's been doing that for all of his life . he does n't think he 's funny . and he 'd probably have no cause either if it was n't for her . ' ' do you
[597/1000]	" where can i take you ? you 're in the middle of nowhere and getting no sleep . " " are you and your son staying in a nice motel ? it sure looks like it . and
[598/1000]	" oh . " i was speechless . " wow , did you pick - " " why do you think they call it a night ? " she finished for me . i ran my palm
[599/1000]	" oh , yeah , um , uh , oh . " " you do n't have to do anything , i do n't mind . " i thought about it . it really was n't my place
[600/1000]	i did n't know why i did it . i was going to find the bastard . i was going to free him . i was going to kill him . not because i loved him but
[601/1000]	" my mum is with me . " he is looking at her with that smile of his . it seems to be one of the natural features of his face : light brown hair , pale blue eyes ,
[602/1000]	" we have an hour before breakfast , " her father insisted . " i want to introduce you to the others . " " of course . " she went back into the kitchen , noting that a
[603/1000]	" you 're going to be alright , " said the pastor 's wife in a comforting manner . " you 're in good hands . then you can return to town soon . " " thank you ,
[604/1000]	he waited , watching them , drinking in their fear and vulnerability . then he looked upon his captors . they were all dark - skinned and black - haired . they wore thick - framed black sunglasses that hid
[605/1000]	" we 'll see , " i mutter . he shifts and pulls out of my clutch . i groan even louder as i get my legs un stuck , even with my sore toes and knees . blake
[606/1000]	* * * * * one night soon , emma reached for her glass of lemonade . she was having this conversation where she was supposed to say , " you do n't have to tell me . we
[607/1000]	" there ! " i jump , looking over at mia . " are you sure ? " " yeah , he 's here . he just got off the phone with greg . " she nods
[608/1000]	" my best friend lives there . " " yeah , i know . " he 'd started to back up - as if he understood her . he moved with her , making sure to walk between her
[609/1000]	" what was she like ? " the girl asked with a hint of sympathy . her mother shook her head , not looking at her , not answering . " what was she like ? " claire
[610/1000]	" i 'm sure he did . he 'd do anything for you . " david gave her an odd look . " like marry me ? " she teased , and david 's face broke into a
[611/1000]	" if you do n't stop that , i 'll ... " she spun the computer around , her computer bag around her shoulders again and walked out of the office . " and take some time to
[612/1000]	" you can give me a hint this way : every single victim has been in a relationship , but not every victim has been involved in a specific relationship . this is all part of the nature of the
[613/1000]	my blood boiled in my veins at the thought of him asking her , and i shoved the door open to let him in , my temper rising along with my blood . but <EOS> and the fact that
[614/1000]	all four of the brothers had been working on the new engine . the first one had just finished with it , as he 'd promised them he would , but it was only seven days with two years of
[615/1000]	and i could n't do it . i just would n't . it was kind of an unbelievable moment . all they could hear were our cries as our bodies shattered in one continuous burst of release .
[616/1000]	i did n't know what for . i had trouble processing it . " i did n't want you to go to denver . " " you had no choice . you were in and out without a
[617/1000]	" we got a house in north carolina . " " are we talking about your dad ? " " no , let 's not talk about him . " my stomach somersa ulted and i began to
[618/1000]	" i have to go . i have to work . i should come over more often . " " okay , bye . " she hung up the phone , stunned and sad . what she 'd
[619/1000]	" we have to use them , " i said , realizing my mistake . " there 's a girl there who can make a phone call . " he turned to me , his brow furrowed .
[620/1000]	" is this your house ? " he asked , his eyes wide and a little surprised . " no . it 's me . " the dark haired man let out a breath , looked at the
[621/1000]	for him ! what had she done to him ? her anger was too great and she needed a moment to recover . but with anger came desperation . the man next to her began to sob .
[622/1000]	" what have you been doing all this time ? doing what mother has been telling you does not bother you ? " i ask . " i 'm surprised , with how well you look . " "
[623/1000]	" then i can use this to help us , " she pointed to the bag covering the creature . " i 've got the last remnants of it , and i 'm going to go pick it up .
[624/1000]	he found the remote to flick the light switch . " where are you going ? " she asked . " to get some food and then go to my place . " he stood at the doorway
[625/1000]	" what ? how could they possibly know ? " " they know , " he said , his brow wrinkled . " what ? " " i have no idea from your records . " he
[626/1000]	" do you know where i could find her ? " i did n't blink . " never . is it safe for you to leave town ? " " the guard knows where i am . "
[627/1000]	<EOS> all that felt worse than the loneliness . i held my breath , not sure how i was going to comfort him . we only stayed quiet while i thought how much that mattered . if she had n't
[628/1000]	" well , you 'll know when you 're doing a job . and so will you . " " i see , " cassie said , but somewhere below the surface of her being , she suspected it
[629/1000]	" i might , too , " he says with satisfaction . he 's still looking at the photo . " ' 0 2 is the new u 17 we got a few weeks back . ' 0 3
[630/1000]	" wait , " he ordered and i waited . he pulled back to look at me and then the warmth and passion in him faded . " for what it 's worth , i 'm sorry . i wish
[631/1000]	" if i do it properly , could i ? " his voice was a little shaky , but it was very tender , and she was grateful . " absolutely . in the meantime , thank you .
[632/1000]	" i love you . " he smiled . how he loved to hear those words from her . " i love you too . " as soon as her feet touched the deck , she ran to
[633/1000]	he had said what he had , and he had no intention of changing . chapter 5 the moment i stepped into the room , i started to cry full length . " oh , my god .
[634/1000]	" the prince is here , " the guards shouted , trying to get them through the door like usual . " take her down into the dungeons , " herr'don said . " if anyone can defeat the
[635/1000]	" we do have a few minutes , " zane confirmed . ty stared at him , and then his eyes widened as he glanced toward the door where zane and kelly stood . " okay , i 'm
[636/1000]	" oh , i saw your card . congratulations . i 'm sure so . you must have some interesting experiences to bring to life . " " it was nothing . " that was all he said ,
[637/1000]	" the girl or the demon she 's playing with ? " i asked . " the demon , " he said . " it 's ... she feels it . " " i feel it , too
[638/1000]	' yes , ' he says . ' it 's better that everyone had a reason to help . if it was n't for them , it 'd have been suicide . but they 're going to help and so
[639/1000]	" as a lawyer , i 'll do what i can . once this is over with , we 'll get what we need from this point forward . whatever you need . anything you need . anywhere you need
[640/1000]	" well , " he said . " you know that i 'm very fond of women with red hair . though , to be honest , i 'm a little worried about what that woman told you ! "
[641/1000]	" no , i just got a new computer . they are n't going to believe my words . " " just do n't say anything incriminating . at least tell me when the new bot is due later
[642/1000]	john was wearing a white shirt when i got home , and had a baseball bat resting on his lap . " where were you when i needed you ? " he yelled . i walked straight to the
[643/1000]	" you 're not taking it easy , are you ? " " i 'm not walking away from this . " " yeah ? well , i 'm walking away from it two years ago . "
[644/1000]	it had never occurred to me that he was gay . oh , how i wished he was . " i asked for a chance for our honeymoon , " he said , his voice thick with emotion
[645/1000]	" and how did we get picked up so easily ? " she asked . " how did you get picked up at all ? " he asked . she held out her left hand for him to
[646/1000]	i frowned . " are you sure about this ? " " you had to have been there . " she shrugged one shoulder . " at least i guess you did . i think we might have found
[647/1000]	" yes , i forgot . i 'm sorry . can you step to the side and let me in ? " i asked politely . she pulled open the door and stood aside so i could get in
[648/1000]	" that would be very hard . " a girl was standing behind the lady , her hands in pigtails , a notebook in her hands . jenny assumed it was her . " the girl i know would
[649/1000]	" in short , in order to gain a better grasp of true history , i can . " " yes ! that 's good enough for me ! " i said , sarcastically . " well ,
[650/1000]	" i do n't know . to be honest , i do n't even know my own name . my parents might have known someone else , but i have n't remembered anything except this . " i heard
[651/1000]	but she was his only concern . as she opened her eyes and stared up at him , waiting for him to continue his kiss , he realized they would have to go over everything until one of the remaining
[652/1000]	* * * a young man in black armor with a helmet adorned with seven red triangles , a broad hel mor ic figure , and an eagle on a banner came up to the group as they stood
[653/1000]	chapter 18 i had n't left the warehouse . we 'd been sitting here , waiting for marcus , waiting for anyone to show up . and then someone had come because they were looking for someone else .
[654/1000]	" are you ready ? " i nodded . he started to put his hand in my pocket again and i snatched it out . " wait . " i slipped a pair of my black ballet flats on
[655/1000]	the rest of those on the boat were gone before i could catch a glimpse of what was happening . that was not a moment to be regretted . the man grabbed a woman 's right arm and yanked
[656/1000]	" right , we 're looking at a couple of possibilities , though . " " such as ? " " like you said , ' maybe they know it was a dream and still killed him .
[657/1000]	" a few years back , back when we first got involved with each other , the feds gave me a nice job . it was a safe job . too safe . they wanted me to follow the career
[658/1000]	he looked over at jack , nodding , and then walked past the kitchen , up the stairs , and into the sitting room with the view of the trees that stretched across the expanse of the green meadow to
[659/1000]	" fine , i admit it . i do n't like it . but it does n't mean there is no chance to make something better of my dad . " " who are you talking about ? "
[660/1000]	" he 's got some ideas , we 'll see . " and there was laughter from the few couples who had still been lingering . alex was just looking at them . so was david . " i do
[661/1000]	" well , you 've lost it again . i 'm not going to beat around the bush , you know what i 'm going to say . " " really ? how ? " " how little
[662/1000]	" maybe we 're wasting our time <EOS> in there , " " that 's my point . " " i do n't need that . even if you did want to see me again , i need
[663/1000]	' maybe , ' he says . ' give us a full report , please . ' he gets down on the floor next to me and peers under them . he reads through some pages , then starts
[664/1000]	" then why are n't you on the beach ? " she hesitated , and i suspected that she was trying to figure out how to tell me she was going to miss me . when she finally spoke
[665/1000]	with a frown , he glanced up from his books . " what ? " " remember when we were walking home last night and you asked me to kiss you in the backyard ? i wanted to dance
[666/1000]	jack and i looked at each other and laughed . " have you seen that ? " i asked . " seen what ? " jack asked . " that i 'm being a goody two - shoes
[667/1000]	" good . thanks . " it is at that point that i put my head on the table . the fear of the unknown is always too great to do anything else but i am the one that
[668/1000]	his mother sighed , a tired sound . he knew she did n't want to be reminded of all the times the two of them had done it together in the kitchen , when it had been a simple affair
[669/1000]	he thought about it for a long time as he struggled to separate a couple of layers of her thoughts . his mind wandered down a couple of corridors , like the old stories his grandmother used to tell him
[670/1000]	this morning jason received a telegram from an old friend , who apparently had nothing but sympathy for his plight . " good day to you , my friend . it 's a pleasure to hear your voice .
[671/1000]	" i 'll make it worth your while , but i do n't know what you 'd do with yourself if you got to know me better . after sex you 're going to need to think about it more
[672/1000]	" yes . " " you are n't , " he said , and there was no humor in the voice . it was hard . " so you are n't , are you ? " i did
[673/1000]	" but all you get is the usual , " simon said , not looking at any of us as he said this . " and then there are the regular days , when you have no way to find
[674/1000]	i let my words hang in the air . as if he can feel my frustration , his fingers lightly rubbed my back . " we may not see each other a lot , but if we 're together ,
[675/1000]	he could n't forget the looks on the neighbors ' faces when they saw him get his driver 's license . he could n't forget the way they 'd looked at him as they 'd been leaving , whispering to
[676/1000]	" you should have no worry on what we were going to go through . there , there is room for you both in my car , " her mom says . i get into the back with the
[677/1000]	but not the girl who stood next to them . " what about you , emma ? " was her only response . it was n't until emma turned to kiss ty on the cheek that james came to
[678/1000]	" there you are . " a short , young man with bright eyes and long black hair stepped aside for a round - faced lass with blond hair , holding open a large glass of wine . she set
[679/1000]	" well yes ... but i did n't know him well , " i replied . " so who do you work for ? " she pressed . " what ? " my face turned beet red and
[680/1000]	" of course . " i was going to say something else , but when i took a step towards the next room , i froze . it was n't just that there was a body lying on the
[681/1000]	" no . there 's no cure , " i tell him . " the virus killed him . " " it did n't kill me , either . " i ca n't help but feel he sounded
[682/1000]	" i 'm not leaving you , " he said . " please , give me a hug . " she wrapped his arms around her and squeezed . he pressed his head against her shoulder and they
[683/1000]	" come on , come on , " molly was yelling now . she started yelling as well , pushing molly toward more of the bars . " leave the poor girl alone . we 'll send someone for her
[684/1000]	" you do n't have to stay back . " she glanced back over her shoulder . he was already stalking forward . " i want to go . " " you have plenty of time . "
[685/1000]	" my father wants to talk to you about something . " sam said with a pained expression . " is something wrong ? " i asked . " actually , my father wants to talk to you
[686/1000]	" no , this is your place , so you can sit right here if you prefer . " she pointed to the couch near where i 'd spent every hour of the previous week here and she gave me
[687/1000]	her eyes suddenly darted to my arms , down to my arm , and then back to my face . " you 'll have to be careful when you go flying through this window , " she said softly ,
[688/1000]	" my , my , " she drawled , her voice oozing sarcasm , " you look good in a pink shirt . " " do i now ? " he murmured , his gaze sliding over her body
[689/1000]	" my father loved her , " elizabeth spoke quietly . " i know her . i am sure miss elizabeth would love you too . " richard returned . " yes , i see no reason for
[690/1000]	i was wrong . she had no idea what to say to me . chapter eight we walked back to my house , her hands in my pocket while i could n't seem to move her one inch
[691/1000]	" no , " she said . " not at all . but you understand . that means the idea of you being with her is a perfect thing to say , right ? " " my heart says
[692/1000]	" where 's everyone ? " asked michael , looking up to the ceiling to see if anyone was in the room . " i do n't know , maybe they figured it out , or maybe they have
[693/1000]	" i 'm going , too , sir . so no more lectures . " " my apologies . sorry . " he leaned against the jamb and gazed into her eyes . " i did n't know .
[694/1000]	" that 's what they wanted too . " " that 's why i did n't get on the chopper with you earlier for the flight . because it 's weird to think of you in a combat suit
[695/1000]	you do n't have an option . chapter twelve monday , july 19 i had n't seen the whole truth about it . the truth was that max and i were only supposed to be seeing each
[696/1000]	" i hear you , " she murmured . he smiled and started to say something else , but she stopped him . " i 'm tired of waiting , " she said , interrupting his attempt at
[697/1000]	" ah - yeah , i know . " he kissed her more thoroughly , nibbling on her swollen lips just long enough to get her to open up . all you had to do was push . he did
[698/1000]	he was talking to another , yet as he looked at her it was obvious that he 'd heard every word . there was n't only a hint of understanding there , but also a quiet resignation , as if
[699/1000]	i took the two mugs and moved to the window that overlooked the green . it was dark in the city now , the red moon up on the sky . i could barely make out the trees .
[700/1000]	" yes i just assumed that i would , given that you are in a bind , miss mitchell . " " and then when i told you no , you changed your mind . " " your
[701/1000]	" tell me what 's going on . " i leaned forward , bracing against the seat back . " i saw a little boy , " he said quietly . " and then he jumped . "
[702/1000]	" but , why did you do it ? " " i hated him . " " whose fault was that ? " " my own , " she said quietly . " how 'd you
[703/1000]	she was a pretty little thing , with large sparkling blue eyes and a sweet - smelling face . he had met her in the market some nights , on both her feet , dancing by herself at the corner
[704/1000]	a moment later , two different people walked through the door , one carrying a plate . with one exception - david . david was the only person in the store , so the owner ran after the strangers .
[705/1000]	" i 'm okay . " beth said in a calm calm voice . " but where 's dad ? " " he did n't make it . " matt said as he helped her down from the table
[706/1000]	" you 're sure ? " he asked . he sounded completely confused , but his voice was not . it was hard to concentrate when it was like this , and that was not possible here . and
[707/1000]	i made a face . " yeah , that 's a good one . what 's good about getting someone to take you out on a date ? " " when i thought my mother had died , it
[708/1000]	" and me ? " " you are a lot like her . the best question , even if you do n't see it , is whether or not you have enough faith in someone to make the choice
[709/1000]	the men in the room had begun to get nervous , and no one wanted to be seen . " what does everybody think we 're doing ? " one man said . the words ' are we
[710/1000]	" there 's still time , sweetie , " my mom said soothingly to me as she tried to wake me . " please , " she demanded . this time i rolled over to look at her . she
[711/1000]	sam and duncan would work closely together to find a way to fix things . no matter what their differences looked like , they cared about each other . in a way she envied them that . she had n't
[712/1000]	she still wanted to kill me , and i was hoping she 'd do it eventually , but that was only part of why . i made it back to the front of the house , trying to breathe
[713/1000]	i glance sideways , watching as he says , " just you . the main thing is you 're okay . i love you . " as he finishes , i turn to watch him , and when i
[714/1000]	" i did n't mean it like that , you know ? that 's not what i mean at all . " " i know . " he kissed her again . " i just wanted you to know
[715/1000]	" i do n't hate werewolves , chris . i do n't need to be a murderer or anything . " " you 're a horrible liar , " chris replies . " how often do you tell
[716/1000]	" sure thing . " frank scratched his chin in wonder . " the last time we were up here there was a pretty big disaster , remember ? the road collapsed on top of us , so we ca
[717/1000]	" it 's the only way , " he said . " you know that . " " i thought you said you 'd take care of me . " " if i could , maybe i would
[718/1000]	you told her exactly that now , you fool . and she would n't have come if you had n't been smart enough to come up with a way to save all of this , to fix everything . you
[719/1000]	" i want to be with you , alex . i know how you feel about me . and you should know how i feel about you . you know how much i love you . i know how sorry
[720/1000]	both of them were silent for a moment . " so what happens now ? " she finally asked . " last i heard you were back at the hotel , " he replied . " i had
[721/1000]	" you could have told me first , " daniel said . " you have no idea what it is to have a child . i wanted to wait until we found out about the pregnancy to get the
[722/1000]	" good , i 'm proud . we need to get you a sponsor . you 've always been so smart , and then you get smart . that had better happen tonight , " my mom announced , standing
[723/1000]	" just a minute . can i talk to you outside ? " i call out to her . " sure . " i get to my feet and put my hand on her arm . "
[724/1000]	" you might be wrong , but i 'm not sure to what it all means . a piece of the ring he wears makes a promise . " " it 's not a promise he makes a promise
[725/1000]	" are you going to tell us who you are ? " it was one of the female cheerleaders on our team . she was tall and lean with light brown hair , bright brown eyes , and a thin
[726/1000]	' yes , your honor , ' the prosecutor answered . ' we will go on record as having told you so . ' ' thank you , you have a wonderful record , mr. wil helm . we
[727/1000]	the phone and speaker clicked loudly as it buzzed . " detective glenn is here to see you , " glenn said . " get out of my house right now , " i warned . " it
[728/1000]	' i 'm a little tired , anyway , ' said the maid meekly . she went about her work , and while the wizards tried to clear the debris of her contribution by eating some of the food she
[729/1000]	" it 's the first one that came out of the old tv . it 's the only one i 've ever wanted . " oh , sweetie , how i wish you had n't left the door unlocked
[730/1000]	" you 're with luke price . " " oh . " i laughed and shook my head . " uh huh . he 's amazing . " " wait in the hallway , " a girl
[731/1000]	the crowd , when they were satisfied she was safely back in their hands , chanted for another round . then , in unison , they drank and chanted until dawn found herself with the only half of the crowd
[732/1000]	her eyelids fluttered open . i leaned over her and thrust deep inside of her . i lay there , a few thrusts in , then pulled out . " you ready to move ? " i asked
[733/1000]	" okay , they did n't hurt too badly , did they ? " " do n't have any . " " you mean , you did n't get hit by any arrows ? " " no
[734/1000]	" he 's not . " i shrugged , as if i did n't care as if he had to explain the difference , " or perhaps he 's just a hard time to grasp . he just came in
[735/1000]	" i am . i am your master . " " i see . then i am yours . " she watched as he undressed and crawled onto the bed . she gazed at his smooth chest until
[736/1000]	this was all i could hope for . it would be quick and sharp . he would n't see the pain in my eyes or the way the realization of my impending demise crushed me . that he would think
[737/1000]	and that was when he began singing , giving the most honest and eloquent speech she had ever heard . an unexpected chill ran up her spine at the sound and she shivered . " how could it
[738/1000]	all three of them were waiting when i strolled out of the kitchen . " you two ready to go , or do you want me to stay and chat with charlotte ? " i asked them .
[739/1000]	" you can do whatever you want but i 'm not walking out on you . " " you have to . " " you 're going to leave . this is how it 's going to work
[740/1000]	" the first of the week of work was on monday , for three days . you were both very nice to me . of course you left late on monday , but you 're working at the bank that
[741/1000]	he stood to go , then stopped again . she stared at him . " are you going to touch these shields again ? " " why ? " " maybe afterward it will be easier to tell
[742/1000]	now that he was n't going to be fighting on the street too , he would stay in position and keep searching . right now it was more important to find her where she 'd just been . he
[743/1000]	" i do n't understand either . " peter 's face was filled with questions . " what 's happened to the police ? " " that 's just it , " she began , but she ended up
[744/1000]	" my lord ? " said the count . " i do n't really know . and in the meanwhile , what do i do ? " said the boy defiantly . " i suggest that the two
[745/1000]	i leaned closer . " with me , i could probably buy and sell more , unless you 'd prefer that a thousand percent , that is . " his face softened , and he bent his head closer
[746/1000]	" is that what it took for you to leave the restaurant ? " he looked at me for a moment then turned his whole face to me , " i 'm sorry . it 's just , i
[747/1000]	" i do n't really like this guy , " she said , letting her gaze travel from the tall , handsome officer to the small asian man next to him . they shared the same auburn hair , the
[748/1000]	" i 'm going to find out about the note , " he said and left the office again with his notebook still in his right hand . victoria noticed how his stride became long when he left .
[749/1000]	" he 's not going to die . " <EOS> ... he could still be in the air , but it was even worse . of course , a glance . " he 's a fool .
[750/1000]	" i mean , seriously man . shit . this ai n't a dream , is it ? " he laughed , shaking his head , and then the mood changed . " so , we got to ask you
[751/1000]	" okay . that 's settled then , " she says . " i called your home number and asked if we could stop by by your son 's place for an hour or so . since you just finished
[752/1000]	" have to give them a reason to go against you . just get past that wall and let them know that you 're serious about going to jail for breaking and entering on monday . and can you get
[753/1000]	" the name of this party is <EOS> , " i 'm here to dance to sing to my sister . " we met the waiter , i came to eat your mother , and we went to the
[754/1000]	she did n't give him time to ask any questions , just said , " put , " and gave him the cue for one of his own . jason heard the thump of a bag slamming down beside
[755/1000]	" do you have any more ? " i asked . " no . " " then there 's not much left so you might as well come over here . the water 's freezing out there .
[756/1000]	" you 've done that before , have n't you ? before making fun of me for it . remember how you got me upset ? " the little piece of him wanted to shake her , to make
[757/1000]	' not on the record . ' " yes , it 's true . i did n't know what to do . they 'd told me i had to work up to it , and i was just being
[758/1000]	" what ? " " do you have to do what i say ? " he asked . " i do n't mean this to be an ass - kissing lecture or an act of violence or anything
[759/1000]	i nodded . " it 's gon na drive mom crazy if she finds out i 'm here . by the way , thanks for the flowers . " " my pleasure . " " i appreciate it
[760/1000]	" that could be an interesting addition , " i told her . " i 'm really glad you and danny are living together . and how are shannon and shannon doing ? " " they are wonderful ,
[761/1000]	" take the book with you ? " he asked . " sure , " she replied quickly , knowing he could n't see her , which was n't an advantage . she ran out the door and got
[762/1000]	it 's gone , but i know i 'll find it . " there we go , " he whispers . " i was going to say that it 's all wrong with us , but no , it
[763/1000]	" thanks , jess . " he shrugged , then pointed at the book on the nightstand . " now get some sleep . " " will do . " she stretched into the position he had indicated
[764/1000]	" i 'm good . why do n't you come in and get out of that damned dress ? " his voice slid down her body in pleasant , husky sensations that sent shivers racing through her .
[765/1000]	" why ? is there something wrong ? " he knew he had to turn into a bat if he wanted to remember her . she shook her head . " no . but i want you to do
[766/1000]	one big , strong hand came up and grabbed hers , jolting her to her feet . instinctively she moved close beside him , her body pressed against his at his back . " we needed to talk .
[767/1000]	" how long do you think it will take for you to contact your pilot and get us off the ground ? " asked sarge . " two hours <EOS> and running the jeep we have gotten off the
[768/1000]	" oh ! " she took a deep breath . " yes , of course ! i was just supposed to ask the young man how it 's going ! " " good , you 're in good shape
[769/1000]	" i want to go home now . i 'm tired of being on the move . " " come on , " said nathan . " it 's not that far to get back . " sam
[770/1000]	i laughed . because i could see it now . the desire to hold her in my arms , to share these moments , was exactly what i wanted to do because the way her chest rose and fell ,
[771/1000]	" of course he did , " i say . " and you 're right . we 'll figure out a way to make it happen . " i nudge my knee uncomfortably toward his . " i ... i
[772/1000]	he swallowed hard and said , " i get the point , but it was nothing . i could n't control her . they should have killed me . " " you saved the day . " i smiled
[773/1000]	" well , you know how it is . " she took a deep breath , " we have our rules and i can see how they are skewed , but you are the one who is breaking those rules
[774/1000]	she was in his grasp , and she took the opportunity . her mouth found his and she sucked . the growl rolled through his mouth , as he broke their kiss for a moment to shove his hand
[775/1000]	" when ? " " in two years . " " are you taking the chance ? " he 's staring at me closely , eyes unblinking ... afraid ? what is it he sees ? "
[776/1000]	a short , round , portly , balding man shuffled to the stairs and started up them . i remembered that he had a new baby with him from college . " what 's this ? " i asked
[777/1000]	" so the bad guys knew you 'd bring one to them , " i say , confused . " was n't necessarily bad , " he says . " could have been quite cool , though . "
[778/1000]	i felt tears in my eyes . " no , i 'm not ... are you ... are you ... are you ... dead ? " " i wish . no one can know that . " his head
[779/1000]	" no , sir , did you look in the wardrobe ? " " no , i do n't carry one of those anymore . " " but if you do , do you carry anything in it
[780/1000]	my chest clenched . he was the reason she was lying here and a part of <EOS> sure he was already over here ! i shoved his hand from my lower back and started to leave , but his grip
[781/1000]	" what ? " alex said . " a question of power for the past several weeks ? " " no , more than that . " " what 's happened ? " " she 's turned
[782/1000]	" what ? " she replied with surprise . " that 's not surprising , but how ? and how come it does n't bother you ? " he drew her closer to him and wrapped his arms around
[783/1000]	" because as much as i 'd like to , i know you two will never see eye to eye on this . " he gave the two women a reassuring stare . " both of you will need your
[784/1000]	" it 's no big deal , " i shrug . " he was just hanging out with the guys , that 's all . " " i had to hit the gym at home some friday night .
[785/1000]	she pulled from his arms and then slipped away . in the corner of the room , her mother and father stood , stunned , and they were n't quite sure what to do with their son . what
[786/1000]	you are lying now , and i do not care . you think you can tell me what i know , that i deserve to be saved . you think i can keep you a secret . and your secrets
[787/1000]	" and this ? " she asked . i met her eyes . " it 's different because we were so young . " " but so innocent . " " but what you said before -
[788/1000]	" it looks like someone 's in someone else 's cabin . " " oh , no , " said rob anybody , leaning forward , his silver hair falling out of his hat . " it 's someone
[789/1000]	that 's the weird thing . once , she 's been caught on the internet and does some work that could possibly scare the hell out of a normal person . i do n't think anyone has ever seen
[790/1000]	" it was a good idea . " when he met her face , his expression was full of love and regret . obviously he would have gone there tonight if he 'd known , but he 'd chosen the
[791/1000]	now we just need to find the killer . lauren tried not to think about her own husband 's killer . and the fact that she was n't dead yet . " we 'll do everything possible
[792/1000]	" where can the man be found ? " the guards looked at one another and they looked at one another . " ca n't be found , i 'm sorry , we can only tell you those
[793/1000]	" oh , i know he left for boston six months ago , " she said , a big smile on her face . " he 's really excited to go . " " how 's my big sister
[794/1000]	" i must , " she answered , " but i have some questions for you . " she did n't wait for his permission and he knew it was for the best . he started to walk away
[795/1000]	the sun was just coming up . it was n't much later than two by far , but the new day was beginning to spill from the windows . my mother , asleep and sound asleep at the rocker
[796/1000]	she came out from behind her desk and closed the door . " how did you get in here ? " " i saw the security light on . it was on the button to the outer office .
[797/1000]	" we found the other two missing , " she said with relief and relief into those eyes . " then we 've never lost them , " he said , " and we 're going to get you
[798/1000]	once she was in his bed , he made love to her then gave her his blood , giving it to her , and giving it to her while his hands did things to her cunt . so much blood
[799/1000]	' we have no contact with our enemy . we have only our own minds . to live is to serve the enemy . we had no choice . if we wanted to die , we chose to fight .
[800/1000]	" then yes , you will be , " she said , and i realized she had not really meant it , she was just teasing me . i felt foolish for not realizing what she and the wolves might
[801/1000]	" i do n't think so , " she said , her voice tight . " those men are going to come into the room , and they are going to come close ; they are going to try to
[802/1000]	" we have no choice . we must fight if we want to reach london . all five of us are not sure what may happen , and it 's not just chance . i 'm sure we will hear
[803/1000]	what are we going to do about today ? as usual , they knew exactly when the problem was , how to fix it . by morning , they had formed a rough plan . they must call
[804/1000]	slowly , i make my way over to her . she 's half in the corner . i kneel down in front of her . " you do n't look so good . " she turns her head
[805/1000]	" do n't worry , you wo n't hurt any of us . " chris said . " you 're right , i wo n't . well , not about you . i 'm just a little surprised .
[806/1000]	" yes , i am but only for a short while but it is the only way i can save you from yourself and the pain just keeps on growing and growing just bigger . " she said with eyes
[807/1000]	" i will . " he watched her slip from the room , then sank onto a bench along a path that led to the gazebo he 'd grown up in . just a few years ago , he
[808/1000]	what ? he thought with dismay . " were n't you supposed to meet me this morning again ? " " you 're not coming to the museum meeting this afternoon ? " there was no point in
[809/1000]	" i do n't know . he also had a little girl and she was all alone . " his mother raised an eyebrow . " she gave birth to a baby girl and <EOS> and she died
[810/1000]	" it was you ? " jake asked . " when ? " " the first time you went off the reservation with me . " jake waited , but no answer came . then reluctantly , he
[811/1000]	" but how is that possible ? what 's the point of this ? " " is n't it obvious ? " " no , it 's not . well , i did n't know they were planning
[812/1000]	" so how does he get out ? " " our friend , " she breathed . " the two of them , " she said with a nod toward the house . " at this point , i
[813/1000]	" no ... " was all he said when she said nothing . he handed her a can of orange juice then they wandered in silence for a couple of blocks until she asked , " so what 's
[814/1000]	" i am , " said the voice . " i have been with the child for almost forty years and i will be back and not long after then we can join the pack together for another battle ,
[815/1000]	" oh that was me ! " i say and point to the water . " so , can we go further ? " " now that i heard that you were in fact going to take that swim
[816/1000]	" no , but if you were n't a threat to the department too , they might have sent someone else rather than you . " i hesitated over the next few words , but finally decided to go
[817/1000]	i did n't know which to believe . " get off her , " adam shouted . one of the guys shoved him and she took off screaming , her head crashing hard against ben 's legs .
[818/1000]	" yes , that 's right , " nick said . " he tried to kill me with a shotgun . " nick watched as ty almost choked on his own saliva . " why 'd he try to
[819/1000]	" it seems we need to stay focused , " a voice said over the intercom . he turned to discover two men dressed in their traditional naval uniform holding her arms down to her sides , their eyes
[820/1000]	" do n't mention that to anyone else . " he was <EOS> up a bit more than usual as well . he was still out . we usually did take in special trips to new houses and did a
[821/1000]	when it came time to have breakfast she was so happy that it surprised herself to find herself in the dining room . * * * * an urgent knock at the massive wooden door made her jump
[822/1000]	" now that 's interesting , " said bates . bates looked at everyone . " so my team is n't the only ones planning to go . " everyone looked intently at bates . " well , i
[823/1000]	" not likely . tell the police what you saw . " the man was silent , then : " look , i 'm not sure how much i can tell you about these things . they 're sort
[824/1000]	" then i guess it 's time we start moving on . i think we have a lot to cover before we get out of here , " i said and put my arm around her . we started
[825/1000]	in those days we were all a fraction in love , and we fell out of love in a perfect storm of love . not for ourselves - for everyone else . but for those that did .
[826/1000]	he looked at me , confused , puzzled , not knowing . you were supposed to have the best of both worlds , " i said , standing and taking several large strides toward jamie . he got to his
[827/1000]	he was wearing new underwear - a big , white - blue , square white . she 's going to the carnival . yeah . i 'm starting to think we should . you want me to
[828/1000]	" yeah , you are . " " what do you call yourself ? " " why do n't you ask that question , mr. parker ? " replied zachary . " but i will say that for
[829/1000]	i stood and reached for the door handle . then i stopped and turned . " you 'd better come back to bed , " i told him . " and you might want to hold on
[830/1000]	" not here , " he said . " not as long as i still have my life . they know . " i looked up at him , the moon bright above us . " i do n't
[831/1000]	" my god , " i choked out . on some level he understood . i would never have broken a rule like that . i would never have told him again . i would only have kissed him if
[832/1000]	her voice was small . she was young ; a good girl . " but you were always careful . your father was always so , you know , strict and a good judge of character . i
[833/1000]	it is the most wonderful thing that anyone has ever done for me , but i know it will be my only time to do it when i am ready , and at this very moment , that time does
[834/1000]	the sound of a single gunshot made them freeze in their tracks . " what - " paul spun toward the sound . the blast was muffled , the bullet barely a whisper of a sound .
[835/1000]	" hello . " " hi , darling , " she said , letting a wave wash over me . i looked up from my phone immediately . " i was just hoping to see you . "
[836/1000]	" he 's going to run . " " if you could stand tall . like one of the other old knights , one who stood his ground until the end . i knew , " she said .
[837/1000]	' in a sense the people who founded those houses got away with it , ' said mrs henderson impatiently . ' there was a lot of looting - ' ' they 're only trying to defend themselves .
[838/1000]	" it is done , her powers are no match for your own . " " how ? " " the power is powerful , for we are a people , and the beast of shadows is a
[839/1000]	" so what ? " " so they can not follow you back to yours . " a wave of humiliation washed over him . what was she doing to him ? " i ca n't stay around
[840/1000]	" they wo n't be happy that you 're away , " he added with an exaggerated sigh . " i know . " olivia smiled . she opened her purse , her cell phone and a small slip
[841/1000]	" i 'll try any of them , " she warned , staring boldly at the small pile of broken glass . " please refrain from killing them , " he said with a sigh . " a woman
[842/1000]	i closed the door and moved to the bed . taking the pillow off the end , i propped it against the headboard to make room for his big body until he was sitting on the side of the bed
[843/1000]	" i need to go talk to mother . " " i know , i know " , she said . at the door that led to the hallway , she turned back . " but i hope you
[844/1000]	" yes but - " the door flew open , shattering the silence of the kitchen , and the room was suddenly filled with the familiar scent of fresh , baked tor til las . a black woman -
[845/1000]	i was so confused , i was n't sure i could think clearly . things were so strange , so out of control . he turned the faucet on behind me , which led me to believe <EOS> more
[846/1000]	" so what do you think of my name ? " " you 'd sound good on the tv . on the radio , <EOS> up . hey - maybe - maybe - oh ! " " he
[847/1000]	" the name is very strange , " she said . " but it sounds arabic or russian . with a capital s. " " that makes sense , " peter said . " the british are saying that
[848/1000]	" yeah , i would think he would have you arrested for assault . " " so that 's what this is about . he thinks just because i 'm pregnant that this baby is his to have .
[849/1000]	" would you stop calling me that ? " i ask . " seriously . did you not know you had a son ? " dammit . " it is none of your business , mrs. mcl ach
[850/1000]	" actually ... yeah . i 've been a little uptight lately ... " " i 'm sure your mom knows how to handle that . " a smile begins to form on his lips as a tiny dimple
[851/1000]	" i 'd say that 's perfect for us . " " what ? you want to steal every last stitch ? we have the best supplies and one of my favorite things in this world . "
[852/1000]	if there was a person that she loved more than her twin , then that was it . did she love aidan ? did she have a destiny ? was she supposed to save him from a fate only a
[853/1000]	his chest seemed to tighten in anticipation of what he knew what she 'd do next . " i know a lot more than i care to . " she stepped forward , her hair falling over both shoulders
[854/1000]	in a matter of moments they were inside the cell . " it 's no joke , " he said . " these doors are sound proof too . " " do we lose them ? you tell
[855/1000]	he chuckled before turning his attention back to the tv . " there , see the name ? it 's one of the guys that ran with the band . he got famous when he went into song playing in
[856/1000]	" well , no , " he said . still in voice - over . " and i think that some of you have never heard of , but there 's some sort of code in it ; it 's
[857/1000]	" you 're very clear on this matter , you know , " i said seriously . " yes , i do . " " let me speak more . " " let me ask you a
[858/1000]	' but she 'd be dead , ' i finally replied , finally getting hold of myself . ' well , you 've woken just in time . ' she smiled faintly . i just stared at her
[859/1000]	" a good job . tell me you never thought about that . " he sighed and shoved his hands into his pockets . " no . i was too busy feeling sorry for myself . " she
[860/1000]	on the third day after the disappearance of the key , david found himself walking across the old city streets , where in the darkness he began to see ghostly shapes moving beneath the shadow and the fog ,
[861/1000]	they followed a winding path around a wooded wall . finally they came to an ancient paved road , and there stood the house of the white bull . it was flanked by three huge stone pillars surrounding it ,
[862/1000]	" we 're not going to start killing people to get to them ! " " there 's nothing wrong with killing people to get to them . your little brother is just the opposite of us , in
[863/1000]	i do n't want to be mad at you for being a dick . i really do n't . but my feelings toward you today were that of shock and distrust . and ... i'm not used to being a
[864/1000]	" now as for the other - " " no , you will not . " " for f * * k 's sake , you started when you were a kid , remember ? " "
[865/1000]	" i know your story , " i said , " you 're scared of something . " " i 'm scared of the life ! " he sputtered . " i 'm scared of killing my fellow man
[866/1000]	" we were n't expecting company . i hope they 're good . " mrs. lincoln stared at him with her black soulless eyes . she was really dead , but her soul floated freely on an unseen loop
[867/1000]	mike was on the phone . " yup , of course there was something . i 'll check it out , thanks . " he hung up and looked at me with a devilish grin . " go in ,
[868/1000]	i do n't bother having a drink with them , or talking to them . i 'm a coward . being alone is worse . this is what i 've been trained to do : the only thing that
[869/1000]	" i 'm here . " he stepped into the room , and when he looked up , rachel realized he was dressed in a black leather jacket and slacks , his black tie loose around his neck ,
[870/1000]	" you want to know why i 'm here , nick ? " " sure , why not ? " " i wanted to get in touch with you <EOS> <EOS> fine china . " " aw
[871/1000]	my mouth dropped open . okay , okay . it was really , really weird . there were two groups of people who could be called strange in this society , and they could get a bad rap for
[872/1000]	" right then , i do n't want to hear you . ever again . or i wo n't call in sick again . got it ? " she swallowed an angry retort . at the moment , she
[873/1000]	i do n't quite want to be caught off guard . he said , ' yes , ' and smiled at me . i had n't really expected that . ' i like it here , ' i
[874/1000]	" well ? " josh snarled . " do n't tell me that some idiot actually made a video of himself going down to the basement . the only way to stop me from stabbing you - " "
[875/1000]	" it may be my only chance . but if it is , then i have to use it . " " what ? ! " " when i took the oath , i thought we could make
[876/1000]	" what ? no , it was just me . i wo n't make him come over . i promise . " " i 'm sure there will be another time when he will know it 's you and
[877/1000]	<EOS> " i could n't help but smile . what the hell is wrong with me ? the phone dropped from her hand , and on the screen i saw a text message from my father 's number .
[878/1000]	" you need to get your shit cleaned up ; i 'm going to go get her , " ty told him . " talk to you later . " " not with my girlfriend pissed off at me
[879/1000]	" i 'm sorry for your loss . the loss of one 's own is hard , but we ca n't let him down because of people like you . " " i think he 's a loser ,
[880/1000]	what had she gotten herself into ? i did n't think anyone was after her . there were almost certainly no witnesses to find her body . they 'd take her place , though . they 'd leave her be
[881/1000]	sam cleared his throat . " uh , okay . " " hey , guys , i just thought my dad was gon na ask you something . " grace 's head snapped up at my words .
[882/1000]	" they are . i 'll write you one . " he started pulling papers out of an envelope on the end table onto which a pen was clipped . he began writing . " the name on the back
[883/1000]	he leaned forward and kissed her forehead . " do n't worry about dad ... he 'll make the arrangements for all of us . " " i like his name , " she told him . "
[884/1000]	" yes , they say once every five years i try and make something out on 'em . they wo n't give me shit , " he said . " well , that 's pretty bad news , but
[885/1000]	he lowered his mug and shrugged , all casual friendliness gone . " you know my mother , from my age . " " it 's nice to meet you . " she stuck out her hand when it
[886/1000]	but these days nothing happened , yet . nothing changed . his days were numbered . he kept his attention on the woman , the dark - haired , blue - eyed woman who 'd spent the past month
[887/1000]	he took out his sunglasses and focused on the road again , searching for an escape route . nothing . the street was empty . " you were all very brave to get into my car to show off
[888/1000]	" just tell me what you have . " he nodded . " it will be less likely your friend will come back . he did n't kill her and he did n't force her death , but there
[889/1000]	the guards took great pleasure throwing the boy away . there was a long pause before both of her boys spoke . her heart sank . it was a bad sign when the guards were usually the more powerful
[890/1000]	" i do n't care . " " you feel you need to play nice with me . " " i said let 's go home . " " oh , not that shit again . i
[891/1000]	i laugh . " no , but she thinks so . she thinks logan and i know each other better than anybody else . " " what , her body does n't have a voice ? " "
[892/1000]	" oh my god , " i whisper , feeling my heart drop . " oh my god . " chapter 24 i 'm back on the ship . i 've been on the ship since i was
[893/1000]	for a moment i thought he was crying . " all right , " he finally said . " i see you found a way for your parents to come back . i 'm sorry you had trouble tracking
[894/1000]	" what did you do ? " i wanted to know what exactly that thing had done to me , but honestly , what else was i going to do ? " the same thing she 's not going
[895/1000]	the house was a long , winding drive . it seemed so imposing and imposing even from ten minutes in the land cruiser . the car came to a stop directly in front of the house , and tony got
[896/1000]	" i made a mistake and i 'm sorry , please do n't punish me . " " no , okay . " she looked at him quickly , but she saw nothing . she saw nothing . her
[897/1000]	" now , we can sit here in total silence , just like at school , all day , and listen to the radio on a sunday . until i 'm exhausted , i am not getting a movie .
[898/1000]	she 'd told him nothing ; therefore , he would be the one to decide . he must not ask questions because she did n't know the answers if there was so much he did n't know already . he
[899/1000]	she got another cookie out and placed it on a plate . " so how have you been , honey ? how 's the house ? " she asked , glancing around . " okay by me .
[900/1000]	the old man frowned in thought , and the older man in tow , shook his head in disbelief . " what is it , old man ? " " your father , " the old man replied
[901/1000]	" that 's because i was always alone . i could n't talk to anyone . none of them could get around me . there was no one i could turn to . not in my life . "
[902/1000]	" i still do n't understand . " i sigh . " you could have made a speech about yourself after you brought in that car . " " yeah , well , i was just tired and stressed
[903/1000]	then , like she 's making a small switch inside of herself , her eyes move to something inside her . and then everything stops completely . a single , brilliant spark of light erupts from her - a small
[904/1000]	" not , i ... " we kissed briefly , and then he did touch . as much as it pained me , i did n't care . " i will be so hungry for you tomorrow , "
[905/1000]	" yes , i did . " " great . now i 'll just give you a kiss and be off with the good doctor . " i give his arm a squeeze and take a step . at
[906/1000]	" in fact , it 's important . it could be our first real interview . " mr. roberts looked down at his desk , " it 's already happened to me once , so i want to make sure
[907/1000]	' no , it 's still a lot to take in , is n't it ? i imagine it 's been a long time since you 've been out . ' ' it has . i hardly know my
[908/1000]	the music continued to drift after what seemed like hours , but was probably only a day or two later . as the room filled , several other couples in the party wandered out . " excuse me ,
[909/1000]	it was the first time i 'd seen his back so strong , and despite myself , i fell in love with it once again . i could n't think of any time i 'd seen it like that ,
[910/1000]	" ah yes , the ' vampire queen ' lady ! " laughed the guard , enjoying the comment . " yes , the queen , " he continued , " in a few months you will have to
[911/1000]	" it 's not a game , captain , " she said under her breath . she began to walk out . " whoa ! what 's going on ? are n't you sick of this place ? "
[912/1000]	" no . " gabriel 's voice was fierce . he kept his eyes forward . he was in no mood for argument . this was something to go his way , and neither michael nor i could figure
[913/1000]	' yes he did ! ' his father said . ' we 've been talking over dinner about it and mr durrant 's had quite a day in the sun and it probably has n't helped that we were late
[914/1000]	" no , " she said , wiping a tear away . " you heard what they said . if anything happens to you - " " i understand , " i said , smiling weakly . " nothing
[915/1000]	" what happened to you , jim ? " " is that what she told you ? " " yes , you 're in great shape . but i must admit , i 'm still a little worried
[916/1000]	" or there is something that i can do for you ; something that i can do for you ; something a little more - unexpected . do n't look shocked . that 's new for me . "
[917/1000]	he closed the door firmly behind himself before i could answer . " it sounds like they 're done . " he leaned back in his seat and began watching the television . " where are the kids ?
[918/1000]	the next morning when he woke , it was to a little message saying that he would be late to catch the bus home . the traffic jams in london and the noise of the bus was welcome after
[919/1000]	" the book of sal pen os ? " she asked . " yes . " he reached up , stroking along her side as she ran her fingers along his arm . " we 're going to find
[920/1000]	" what do you mean , ' it 's only a matter of time before you 'll die ? ' you said you did n't actually want the job . " " i do n't want that job .
[921/1000]	" she saved my life . you can ... " his voice had cracked , and she knew his mind was on it . after all , did n't he still understand what the elders were telling him ? how
[922/1000]	" that he did , " grace muttered under her breath , her head cradled in her hands . " all right . back to the subject at hand . how about the past ? how are you getting
[923/1000]	not anymore . " you know i 'll still be here , right ? " " yes . and i know you 'll continue to be . " she shook her head slightly , and her eyes narrowed on
[924/1000]	" do you know why they think i have n't been taken ? " it was about three quarters true . " because they intend for a demon to be the key . " she shook her head .
[925/1000]	i walked down the hallway of the inn toward the living quarters , then turned left , where the windows offered an incredible view of the valley below . the bright moon was bright and high , and the grass
[926/1000]	" no the girls , of course " beth said . " oh no , do n't kid yourself , it 'll happen , " said ben . " what ? is that you , ben ? are
[927/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , sir . this may be too much to ask ... " " please do n't try to apologize , young chap . i understand . at least i know the other day -
[928/1000]	' oh , ' i said , my voice caught , ' i 'm sorry , i was n't going to ... ' ' good for you , you saved me . ' bastille glared at me , then
[929/1000]	an excited buzz sounded in the air around them as a group of businessmen jumped aside and watched in anticipation as an aged waiter hurried over to take their order . " oh yes , what 's their favorite
[930/1000]	" it 's not our way . my father does n't like to use such a language of any kind . " that much had never crossed claire 's mind , and she remembered - for the first time -
[931/1000]	the vampire and hunter broke from the shadows and headed toward the main hallway . hunter 's fingers closed around her forearm . this time , she did n't jerk away . " i 've got you . " too
[932/1000]	my father stepped closer to me . " what is the nature of this conversation ? " my dad took a few steps closer , and my mom pulled my father 's arm to stop him . " evan
[933/1000]	the group stepped off the dock into an open space with a small patio near the small square door to the building at the far end of the plaza to the right . inside , as far as they could
[934/1000]	the girl in the sky shrieked in pain . there was an arc of blue and yellow exploding in front of them . white light spilled out outward from the points and through the smoke and vapor of the explosion
[935/1000]	it was hard to concentrate on words and phrases with that stupid , heavy sack over the head and all . <EOS> only stared at the car . a new plan and his dog had been shot a
[936/1000]	i looked back down at the pile , my gaze drawn to the two black leather - bound books beside the book i 'd tucked under my arm . my eyes narrowed . " your blood test ? "
[937/1000]	" i 'm glad you chose to come with me on this trip , " mike whispered to mike . " i 'm happy to help , i can offer many things to your team in exchange for all your
[938/1000]	it 's always your turn now . chapter one a quiet , sunny morning in upstate new york , the light warm enough for snow in the mountains in upstate new york , i did , for a
[939/1000]	" you 're right , i do . so let 's keep moving . where are we going ? " " follow our noses to the nearest building . it will be your office if you have questions .
[940/1000]	the next day i left work very early . i took two deep breaths as i stepped out of the cab and ran to my car . when i pulled up , i saw a police car and had a
[941/1000]	" wait . who the hell are you ? " " i 'm a guy , " replied john with a quick breath , " and am not going to leave . now where were we ! "
[942/1000]	my mouth would fail me . i 'm suddenly incapable of swallowing . " um , hi . " the words feel brittle and raw and useless . " i 'm very sorry to hear about your mom .
[943/1000]	" now that 's kind of interesting , " i replied nonchalantly . " it 's going to be a fascinating evening , i 'm sure . " i turned at the sound of his laugh behind me ,
[944/1000]	" is that you , daddy ? " it was so strange - somehow it all did n't feel real . the music fell silent . it was the last time i 'd spoken with my father .
[945/1000]	" i do n't know , " he huffed , " but it seems like a great idea . i miss her so much ! " " you do n't , " nick answered , nodding to the girl
[946/1000]	" i thought you knew that . " " i do , but i 'm sorry i made you wait . " when she noticed charlie had n't changed into his uniform , she wondered why . why
[947/1000]	he studied her for a moment and then answered , " at this very moment , my little lady , i am here to see the old white lady . i realize you were frightened by what she might take
[948/1000]	the doors slid open , revealing the hallway . after a moment 's hesitation , he ducked under the doorframe , then pulled the door closed behind him . he paused there , ready to lead the way . he
[949/1000]	" go on , get in my room , so i can help you , " james replied . he then reached to a chair ; he pulled it next to her and set it down . then he undid
[950/1000]	she frowned . " can you still teleport if i 'm there ? " he nodded . " but what about blood in the car when it does n't work ? " he took a deep breath . "
[951/1000]	" the boys should be here soon , " i whispered to him , thinking it was rude not to thank him for making it easy on me . we stood together for a full minute before he finally
[952/1000]	" stop worrying . i promise no harm will come to anyone with my name stamped on them . it should n't take too much to put them in a comatose state . " still slightly nervous , she
[953/1000]	nick 's expression softened . " i want to be here . " " and i want you to be here . " she put her index finger under his chin , tipping up his head . " but
[954/1000]	" all right . " " good . i 'll see you at noon . " " two o'clock . " " ' bye , boss . " with any luck he 'd be gone by then
[955/1000]	" so why are we sitting here ? " she asked . before he could answer , a door popped open , and the next thing he knew , both of them were being hauled out onto the top
[956/1000]	as if sensing his hesitation . slowly the dragon approached . its wings beat faster as if to draw every drop of blood from korsten 's body . his stomach churned and he was afraid that what he saw was
[957/1000]	" it 's cool . " he reached down and picked up a handful of pebbles , shaking them in the air . then he tossed one out at random for his friend . " stop trying to kill
[958/1000]	' the truth , ' she said , ' is that i do n't want the same things from him . i do n't want a son i 've never had . i do n't want him to become an
[959/1000]	" yeah . you and your boss are a force of nature . " " i 'm not a force of nature . " " we 'll see about that . " the man turned and left the
[960/1000]	" i can do this . " " fine . if i 'm weak , you 're done , " ethan said , moving his hand toward the trigger of the shotgun . " i 'm not weak
[961/1000]	" who are you talking about ? " " someone has been watching your house since you were up . " " i told you it was no one . " the door opened , and in
[962/1000]	with a sinking heart , alex realized she had no choice but to keep going . * * * alex slept on the cot , terrified that she might regret it , but at least she was alive
[963/1000]	he saw that the light was coming from the right side of the car . he walked over and was glad to see that the driver was still in a white bmw . apparently the bmw had n't been destroyed
[964/1000]	" good . " daniel 's voice was grim . " you should n't have come in this way tonight . " " but - " he pushed her lightly away . " stay behind me . "
[965/1000]	" yes , that is true . i 'm not from this world . she may have asked me , but ... well , she did n't ask me if i want all the gifts . she just wanted me
[966/1000]	" okay . " he reached over to grab her arm , pulling her close before she pulled away . " no , you see , i 'm also making a little comment that applies to you for your
[967/1000]	" he told me , " i murmured , knowing she could n't hear me . i could n't remember anything about his first night at the bar . he 'd been drunk , and i did n't know what
[968/1000]	" i - you have to be kidding me , " she said slowly . " what 's going on with these people ? " " i 'm sure your father is telling you stuff i would n't share
[969/1000]	" well , i do n't know , " she replied with a glance at the door . " i probably should n't be doing this . " " what ? " she laughed at him . "
[970/1000]	" are n't you going to say anything ? " i shake my head . " do n't you want to know if he 's okay ? " " why ? " his hazel eyes narrow
[971/1000]	" you told him the truth . i know he thinks i 'm cheating . i had to hide that shit from him , because he 's the only one who is . " " i 'm glad that
[972/1000]	' you are , um , very ... interesting . ' ' a bit , ' said dibbler . ' and i wonder if you could help me out ? ' silver fish glanced at the young man
[973/1000]	" are you going to kiss me now ? " she taunted . " what the hell do you want ? " he growled . " your kiss . " " kiss you ? i do n't
[974/1000]	" no , i 'm sure we 'll have better luck at it . we do n't even know how many guys there are at this point that we can count on . " " i do n't like
[975/1000]	" okay . i 'll tell him . " " thanks ethan , i really appreciate it , " i said , just as he was leaving . he nodded back to me and made his way out
[976/1000]	" why are you here ? " i whispered and stared up into his blue eyes . " i have to say though , you do make me feel crazy , " he said suddenly . i pulled back
[977/1000]	" i 'm not even sure if it means anything . " with his left hand , he ran a finger over the back of his right shoulder , leaving a trail of black hair . " the words stuck
[978/1000]	" i do that all the time . i 'm not making it up . get it . " he laughed , but his smile did n't quite reach his eyes . " how much ? " she
[979/1000]	" we better start out a little early and get back to the house , too , " i said , putting my hand on his arm . " i 've got a lot to cover tomorrow . "
[980/1000]	" i know this is n't much , but we should go a little farther down , when we get a moment . if it 's an outcropping we can climb , that 's a good idea , and we
[981/1000]	' the boys were born here <EOS> at last here , at last the mother of the sons . she 's a little less - ' ' like a long . ' i smiled as she was staring
[982/1000]	" yes . i do it anyway . " they had <EOS> <EOS> . " i 'd rather , but i ... " i figured out what beth with forever for a new game . that was
[983/1000]	i was thinking of what it would be like to have a male with white teeth . " yes . " " now i 'm wondering what women are like everywhere . " she giggled . i
[984/1000]	" can i stop by the shop someday ? " he asked hesitantly . " what am i going to do ? call my grandfather ? " he smiled at her weakly . " so you can get
[985/1000]	" he said that ? " " that 's what he said . " " if only he knew me better , " her dad said . " he 's a f * * king idiot . "
[986/1000]	he pushed off the wall and glided his hand along the floor as he moved , walking into the bathroom . his hand caught sight of an oval plastic container on the counter , and he picked it up and
[987/1000]	all the same , i do n't think it was his idea , but i can tell with every fiber of my being that i have somehow ruined all his plans . i could never handle his wrath - i
[988/1000]	with reluctance , they made several decisions , for all the good it would do her , one of which was to keep herself from thinking about jack in any way . he 'd turned her into his wife .
[989/1000]	" no ! i mean - no , i just think that she got rid of them at the same time as you did . " " but , but they 're still in her house ! not my
[990/1000]	" i wish ... " " yes ? " " you wish i were n't so obsessed with her ? " it was n't a question i answered honestly , but i nodded . " yes
[991/1000]	" we ca n't think of anything . " mr. bor in ski sighed . " you 're right , he ca n't be trusted , either . " " to whom would he be trusted ? "
[992/1000]	" what are you doing ? ! " i pushed myself off the bed but she held me in place . " i 'm at my best when you 're angry . you 're impossible when you 're angry .
[993/1000]	but , of course , it was n't - a half - dozen more warriors and vampires filled the hall . all had red eyes and fangs . these were n't new members of leto 's class , but
[994/1000]	the next was probably the hardest . why did he love her so much ? love , of all things ? she had n't seen a few faces so young . she was young this morning , at the fair
[995/1000]	" you 're a damn stubborn one , are n't you ? " " you 're the stubborn one , " i say and lean forward to run my hand through his hair , careful of his hair that
[996/1000]	she leaned against the door frame and waited for him to come out . he had to come out , too . he said , " i 'm leaving today . " " what 's going on
[997/1000]	" yeah , but i 'd still find her a new place to live . a place that 's pretty clean and not cluttered with dirty clothes , " said jack . " she 's not a cleaner . "
[998/1000]	she turned to see him pacing , holding his phone to his ear . " excuse me ? " he was dressed as she remembered him : jeans , a polo shirt , and navy blazer .
[999/1000]	" and there is a point in the whole process when , under the rule of captain tru mble , there is a limit to your influence and influence . " " that was the rule of tru mble
