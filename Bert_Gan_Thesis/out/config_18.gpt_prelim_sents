[0/1000]	" um , i thought i found something , " the female said as she peered through her binoculars . " do n't tell me . " the male sighed in disgust and returned his attention to the screen
[1/1000]	" i know , " he said . " you 're helping , " she said . " that does n't take away from your story . and you really did save me . and i 'm so glad
[2/1000]	" you want this . i 'll give you everything you 'll want . " he laughed with genuine amusement as he reached for her . she gave a cry of pain and tried to pull her arms away
[3/1000]	" never . at least not until now . " for all his confidence , it took almost twenty minutes for the other people to complete their tasks and clean up for lunch . after that , riley
[4/1000]	" fine . it 's an official date , " she said , looking between me and her mother , with a half smile on her face . " an official date with whom ? " asked mom
[5/1000]	" you do not have to be so , " lady margaret said . " now , what was important was the idea of the crown 's grace . " " the queen has taken offense at the whole
[6/1000]	" no . thanks for the offer , " i said , and i thought i saw a tremor in his throat . i checked out my door . no one was closing it , but apparently someone had
[7/1000]	she smiled sadly . " it 's just that i so want us to get married and i want kids . " a heavy feeling of despair settled in the pit of his stomach . how did she say
[8/1000]	and at the same time a black cloud engulfed his sense of sight and sense of smell . " do n't breathe , " i said . " do n't ... breathe . " he gave me another
[9/1000]	" i think you 're right , " i whispered into the night air , " but where does it all fit in with what you 're seeing ? if we start with what you really understand , then it
[10/1000]	his breath came out in a slow rush . " you want me to seduce you . " deliberately , he released her shoulders and ran his hands over her br * * sts and belly , over her hips
[11/1000]	and what 'd she do for a living ? something she did a lot . no , wait ... she liked books , at least they seemed like books . that , of course , made it sound as if
[12/1000]	" good morning , my lord , " a plump plump woman answered . ' ' good morning , lord . " " your name ? " " mother stine , and thank you . " he
[13/1000]	" come out of this house and out of this city a virgin in every sense if you dare , " said the man . he was staring at his daughter as if she was a doll .
[14/1000]	i grinned as i looked at the photo at the bottom of it and shook my head . " that 's a great image , " i said aloud and lifted the marker to the back of the photo .
[15/1000]	' it 's very convenient , ' she said , her voice crisp . ' good luck doing this . if you can , i know that you can , and i 'm confident that it will make this problem
[16/1000]	i saw the flash of pain flash across the man 's expression as he realized he had unintentionally surprised me again . but it was the thought of what i was about to do to him that held my attention
[17/1000]	" the war is coming , " the woman said . " all you are is a good girl who grew up without family obligations , without anything , and so you can see why i am so much worried
[18/1000]	she was n't about to argue once more . a few feet from the open end , a deep hollow rose out of the ground . " that 's it ? " she gasped softly . "
[19/1000]	she was almost in tears , but she stopped to put her hand on a nearby tree . " yes , " she said . " what is it ? " asked adam , peering above her head and
[20/1000]	" i should take ' er , but ... " " you mean to say you are n't sick ? " suggested polly . " oh ... yes . to be sure , that might n't be an option
[21/1000]	" why in heaven 's name would you need me ? " " you need to give me your word that you wo n't try to contact them at this time . we 're going to be the ones
[22/1000]	that 's right , " he said . " the old man said he 'd set it up as my field and put my study at the same time . did n't want to let me leave today . "
[23/1000]	she was already feeling better now . the pain from the first wound and the bite had faded to a manageable ache . he stepped closer , his shoulders squared . " i 've changed my mind . i
[24/1000]	" we know who did it , " said the one who was the cop . " we did n't do anything , " said the other guy . " give us the evidence and we 'll go away
[25/1000]	" right , " she said . " so he wants to be a knight ? i thought guys fell all over themselves for the opportunity to have their knights ? " " of course they do ,
[26/1000]	oh lord , please do n't let me see him ! " you are a genius . " he stops . i glance at him and look back up at the board . not the right word ,
[27/1000]	" what ? who ? , " he sputtered . the words stuck in his throat . " you . do you have any idea what you 've put me through ? " " no , i do
[28/1000]	" yes , sir ! " tom answered as he returned from the locker room . this was much easier than the previous night . now i no longer had to make decisions . * * * sitting
[29/1000]	his smile faded , his gaze fixed on his son . " i do . you came back for you , but you never returned . " " so what 's the verdict ? " but his eyes
[30/1000]	" this morning , all three of them flew in from san francisco , and now it 's just me , or perhaps a few pairs of four wheel drive trucks and a couple of golf carts . i just
[31/1000]	' are you sure that 's what i ought to do ? ' the duke asked . ' i would n't worry that much , duke . it wo n't do you much good anyway . ' the
[32/1000]	i would like to say that my life turned out well , but i truly had no idea of what i had done . the night of the shooting , i had no idea how it had happened . i
[33/1000]	" you 've never used that type of skill , " he returned . " if you want to spend the night in the sun , then it 's up to you to choose one or the other .
[34/1000]	" you 'll do . there 's no reason to tell us where you live either . as far as we know , you wo n't be at work until tomorrow . " no way were we having him
[35/1000]	" you 're here because you 're scared . " that was what he thought . like a teenager or a kid . he was about to defend himself to his father once again , and he did n't like
[36/1000]	" thank you both . " alex squeezed my hand lightly and then released me . " i 'll see you next week . i 'll let you know how the session goes . " as i walked
[37/1000]	she did , and what a surprise it was when she did . but before he could point out that there was nothing here for her but the place with her , she moved down a slope and stopped .
[38/1000]	" you must be hungry , " he said . his eyes blazed with awareness . " i 'd love to take care of your needs . " " you would ? " her heart hammered and something fluttered
[39/1000]	" i 'm sorry to sound so disappointed in you , " he said , voice softening . " but i thought you might be able to help with this . " chapter 22 max stared down at
[40/1000]	" like what ? " she asked again . " i do n't know yet . " i looked around . " where 's sam ? " even if we did catch up , i did n't want to
[41/1000]	" i can speak your language , " i replied . " then you will be here for three days , " he replied . it did n't take long for me to go into an energy fluctu
[42/1000]	a man in khaki pants stood at the door , head cocked slightly behind it to listen . i knew what he was hearing . i also knew why it had bothered me so much until now . so
[43/1000]	" i was n't <EOS> i did n't want your company . " their relationship is that close or not . we can go on days and dates , night - and - day . " i told
[44/1000]	" is that what happened ? " " yup . " " oh my god . is there anything i can do ? " " who knows ? " " if there is , i could
[45/1000]	' we saw you , father , ' bevier said , ' and then aphrael came to eat . i called you at the gate . ' ' i took the liberty of ordering a very large supper ,
[46/1000]	" you are probably right . either way , we took a chance . " * * * when ben arrived home after his two days ' driving , he realized that his car was n't there .
[47/1000]	" i 'll take her back to bed , " i told him . he stared at me , then ordered , " kiss me back , " and with great effort , he lifted the hand which was
[48/1000]	i sigh again as my body curves around his . a few more seconds of being carried around by this boy , and i 'd be lost at home in oblivion . " so you think we 'll be
[49/1000]	" it is n't that bad of a job . " she continued quickly . " i was n't sure if it would be a problem . " it was n't that difficult for a man to think he
[50/1000]	" just give me the phone , would ya , please ? " tom said to me . " oh , fine . i 'll keep it in my purse . " tom flipped open the phone and
[51/1000]	" what does that mean ? " asked jill , with a skeptical tilt to her head . " well , if i say something out loud , you 'll know i 'm an immortal , not just a
[52/1000]	" i found you in jail ... " he said quietly . " it 's not fair you stole me back ... " " you did n't exactly get your hands on me ... just the idea of
[53/1000]	" i am a healer ! " the girl was saying . " it is my job to ease your pain . now , you fall asleep . " she gently tapped his forehead . " i dream ...
[54/1000]	" that 's something , i guess , " she said for the second time that night . " so , how 'd that go ? " " good , " he said . " really ? "
[55/1000]	the only man sitting outside the door , aside from the one in the seat across from the seat , who was looking up at the map and reading it over , was a short man with a narrow face
[56/1000]	" you do n't need to worry . i 'm fine just fine . and thanks , i 'm really happy for everyone you like , especially your mom , " she said as my mom nodded her head .
[57/1000]	" there 's very little the queen can do , is there ? " " not when she 's using our mother as an avatar . " " there you go then , " polgara said pleasantly .
[58/1000]	" what about you , kate ? " katie asked . she had been trying to reach her , but had not been able to get through . " just a couple of friends , " she admitted ,
[59/1000]	" that . " but , the bastard was right . she had n't been there looking for a party . she 'd been there because of him . she 'd stood by his side , the last person
[60/1000]	" um , no . it 's just that i have a ton on my mind , " i said as i leaned of all my weight on my elbow . " does it matter you have an hour
[61/1000]	the king smiled briefly . " no , i 'm not . i need you . " " am i supposed to guess who the princess is then ? " i looked over at my little brother , who
[62/1000]	the two of them , the two girls who were meant to teach her . she should have wanted to sit on that desk all day , but she could n't . despite the fact she was a lot taller
[63/1000]	" sorry about that " says billy at a loss for words " he also told me to wait there . i did n't want to offend , sir . how can i pay for your drinks if i 'm
[64/1000]	" i am not in the mood for your sarcasm , " i growled . " i 'm not trying to mock you , i told him about our conversation in portland yesterday afternoon . he said you were
[65/1000]	" yeah . " even with his jacket and open , that was n't enough to hold her up , so he gathered her closer to him , his arm so gently cradling her head as he bent over her
[66/1000]	" ok , what next ? " " well , it 's not really a plan , only a question . in the case of the king , i think we will be able to locate what was stolen
[67/1000]	" the wolf was not of wolf shape . the black panther was of a man , and she a wolf . when the wolf approached her mate , he was angry , and he attacked . he ripped her
[68/1000]	" i asked them why , then they said that it was to prevent strangers from searching the territory . and that the land was under the care of someone on the people 's side at that time . the
[69/1000]	and so now they were all going to have to face down that last part . " well , i guess we can start right away . " his grin was predatory . " but first ... " "
[70/1000]	i had been worried about that . " so , your mom 's okay ? " " yeah . i , uh , we are . she 's fine . " " i 'm glad , " i
[71/1000]	" what 's going on ? " i asked . " we 've been out here all night . " " it 's too early to go in about now . " " i want you there
[72/1000]	what am i doing with him ? i should n't have kissed him back . what if he sees me coming with my sister ? i do n't know ... * * * i wait for sean
[73/1000]	his jaw tightened . " shit , that 's a lie . she came to me , thinking she could bring you back to me . " " but you 'd turned her down . " the way she
[74/1000]	" the only one in the last day was the one where i met him and the one that died . i have no idea where that particular one came from or what it wanted . " he tilted
[75/1000]	" that is a new name for you , but actually , you will have me on your team for quite awhile and i will be your host . " kelly nodded . " thank you . "
[76/1000]	our next stop is the black and white chec ker board board of the shop where i pick up shoes in pairs with six inch heels on each foot . it 's also time consuming , but so i figure
[77/1000]	" sorry , but i have to get back inside , " i said , and walked to the front door . my lips parted and i could taste him , his flavor a mix of cinnamon and rich chocolate
[78/1000]	she ignored the obvious implication , letting him assume that he was already getting in the way of our little adventure . " what if there is n't an answer ? what if there 's no way around the first
[79/1000]	" i , um ... a lot . we 're all <EOS> what ? what do you mean ? " emma asked , wondering where this was coming from . " is there really no one to help ? "
[80/1000]	" to the last one in thirty seconds , too , " he added with a smug smile . " but you might wanna see something on your own before i do it , now . what 's that corner
[81/1000]	" i know what you mean , no . " i swallowed , unable to look at him when i imagined that i would break over the line of the camera , if it got me what i wanted .
[82/1000]	" the man who found the dragon woman , " she said once his mouth was closed , " he set fire to it and called me to him . you see , " she admitted , and her gaze
[83/1000]	" yes , " i breathed . they moved the table and chairs out of the way and the bed , sheets and comforter , then i saw a black purse open and out popped a pack of cigarettes ,
[84/1000]	his c * ck was heavy and his balls ached in response , his jaw clenched tight . he had n't had a chance to rest and then some , if how it looked . the sound of
[85/1000]	or what there may be to die of , she thinks , but she is alone , and not out there alone . she is outside , watching and imagining , waiting to see if there 's anything there -
[86/1000]	he 's going to drive us away ! i screamed at him , but something said that if he was walking away , that we had no chance . " we 'll survive without you , " james told
[87/1000]	i turned my attention back to the house and the boys , and not once did i take my eyes off them . that was a mistake . the moment i touched daniel 's knee , i knew .
[88/1000]	after a few moments her voice came back , low and weary . " something just came up . can you see it ? " she said . " see what you can make out ? " it was more
[89/1000]	oh , fine . i was here to collect my mother . and he 'd just gotten a look at her . " just the normal ... my " - she nodded toward my grandmother - " the normal
[90/1000]	i do n't . i have to move fast . not like that . not just the way i should , like i have to . i just want someone to know . the truth is
[91/1000]	" sorry for upsetting you , " said alex . " ca n't say i 'm displeased , " replied jonathan . " i think i thought we were friends , " said alex . " well
[92/1000]	" i do n't know , " i whispered . " then get up , " he urged . oh god . frey . " i 'm all right , i 'm all right , "
[93/1000]	we walk past the coffee shop and straight to the library . " can you come to my office and give me a quick rundown ? " my father called me earlier , after the big argument . "
[94/1000]	he nodded . " then i 'll leave you alone , " he told her . " in case they notice . " * * * she had a small apartment in the city . it was small
[95/1000]	" that you do , " he nodded . " very good . " the priest went on , not waiting for cole 's response . " what we have discussed in it , however , is that our
[96/1000]	" that 's right . he wants to get back together with your dad . " " really ? " i said , trying to keep my face neutral . " she 's having a hard time with
[97/1000]	we hurried out of the cave - in as quickly as we dared , taking in ragged gasps of hot air . the world felt cooler . in other circumstances it would have been difficult to judge my mood with
[98/1000]	" the police are making a statement on your whereabouts ? " i ask . " yes . at the station . " his eyes get wide . " they 're here . " " good , "
[99/1000]	the door swung open and michael stood in the room , a smile stretching on his lips . " hey there , " shane , his pale - as - snow beauty , said . " you look good
[100/1000]	" just one thing , " he continued . i did n't want to hear his explanation . i wanted to find myself . " please be careful and ask me questions about the necklace , " i said
[101/1000]	" it 's been really nice to meet you , lady . " now , come on , the man was lying in a hospital bed so i had to be a little more sure . she must not
[102/1000]	" you think so ? " " of course . " he shrugged . " i 'll make a deal with you . tomorrow , i 'll go with you to your parents ' house . i 'll
[103/1000]	a large man with a long , mustache pushed back the heavy leather chair , and she realized he was close to the woman . his suit was a dark blue and charcoal gray , but even in the muted
[104/1000]	he grabbed my shirt from the floor , tearing it off my shoulders . i shrieked and made a move for him when his hand clamped over my mouth . his other hand came over my other hand ,
[105/1000]	" how about what you 're doing now ? " " i can figure it out . " his hand dipped to cup my ass . when i tried to pull away , he was n't giving me much
[106/1000]	chapter 34 : battle for the crown the moment the final light dimmed , they arrived at the same clearing . there was no need any longer to be able to think where they were . it was
[107/1000]	" you want me as much as i want you , " he argued back . " i love you , " she told him truthfully . " very much , but love makes people believe i 'm unhappy
[108/1000]	" hey , mom , " a familiar face says when i knock on her door . " you doing okay ? " i look at sean , and he nods as i open the door an inch
[109/1000]	she looked down at the stack of keys in her hands . " i 'm not <EOS> up for that , but if you just have a thought or two , say , try again . " all of
[110/1000]	his jaw clenched in that tight way that infuriated me . " do you think you were so smart ? " he asked , a smile playing about his lips . " do n't start with me . "
[111/1000]	" no doubt , mr. makepeace , " sir anthony replied . " the girl must be somewhere along that line . " they were back in the ballroom in a minute , and isabel was nearly falling out
[112/1000]	" this is the only way to contact the police in this area , " he says carefully . " i 'll look after you . " i 'm about to tell him no , and he does n't
[113/1000]	" to be honest , i was n't with myself . " he lifted a shoulder and took a small sip of his drink . " i guess i just was n't willing to take the risk of being honest
[114/1000]	" nothing ? " the question was n't feigned . " i 've been through the building . " there were no other words . they could n't have moved fast enough if one of the doors had been
[115/1000]	" i 'm guessing there 's little point , " he said sardonically . " i 'd say she 's safe for the moment . " " you did say she 's under observation , right ? "
[116/1000]	the crowd broke like a wave and we were back in the safety of the cabin . " thank you , " i said . he gestured to the door . " come on out . "
[117/1000]	" it has to be the most beautiful place on earth , " he replied . " the mountains are the only places that 're flat even if you 're wearing high heels . " he pulled her close and
[118/1000]	" i 'm not . " " yes you are . in every step . " " well , actually i am not . " " oh , but you are . " " am i
[119/1000]	" you want to go with me ? would it be a bad idea to hang out in the middle of the day with you ? " sam pulled his shirt over his head . " you can crash
[120/1000]	" you 're being dramatic , and as usual in situations like these , i do n't think that 's it , " i call out to her , and she stops mid - stride , her eyebrows lifting in
[121/1000]	" let me guess . you 're mad at me or something . " " yeah , of course , " he drawled . " what happens when i 'm mad at you ? " i pursed my
[122/1000]	" okay , so we need a plan . if you can grab a knife from a neighbor , i 'll get the knife . what do you think ? " he 'd made a decision . i could tell
[123/1000]	the doctor ran the blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff the same at two
[124/1000]	" who 's been paying you to play their game ? " i asked , feeling better even though i knew how much had to be left unsaid . " who 's funding you ? " he turned his
[125/1000]	he had already started to crawl backwards . " come on , " we said in unison to the same sound . " you made me so pissed , " she said . " your turn ,
[126/1000]	" so , " i said , " maybe it was a case of my own . who had an affair . " he gave me a strange look . then he looked at his watch . "
[127/1000]	they arrived with the other contestants . the others waited in the room . she reached out to touch jake , who looked as if he would jump her . he took her hand as he introduced her as
[128/1000]	his voice was still as low as it had been the first night he would speak to her : a deep and slow rumble that curled around her bones and seeped into every corner of her being . "
[129/1000]	his hand slid to the back of my neck , curving my head in , and he took my lips . when we finished . when it came , it was deep and slow , like he had
[130/1000]	he was glad her eyes were closed and her face was peaceful . he liked to see her like this . in the light , she looked happy , and he liked that . he wanted to know about her
[131/1000]	" you do n't really think i 'm going to believe that ? is n't it your kind of faith that is to blame for all of this ? " " of course . why would n't i ?
[132/1000]	" i 'm sure it 'll all work out , " said david , his voice filled with hope . " you have nothing to fear . " " you love her , do n't you ? "
[133/1000]	" as well you should , " she said . " i made the mistake of telling you i 'd never been with anyone else . " " and did you ? " he asked . " of
[134/1000]	the boy had pulled the cover from his mouth and was looking into his empty left eye . he threw the body to the ground . the mother in the other room screamed , then started to cry . the
[135/1000]	" actually , " said the older gentleman . " it 's true and it 's not . the past can be a little hazy . the original colonists ' population of this galaxy was roughly 150 million , 000
[136/1000]	" do you hear yourself , child , or is it just your mind playing tricks on you ? " " it 's been going on for a while , " she admitted . " i 've heard
[137/1000]	' we should do a proper rescue mission , ' dillow said . ' i 'm not sure my ship is in repair yet . ' cragg said to dillow , ' we need to start preparing for the
[138/1000]	" i 'm off to see my uncle at work , " she said , rising to her feet . " wait a minute , " the other man started , trying to talk to her . " i
[139/1000]	" but she says it is n't going to happen , is it ? " he growled , clearly amused at my confusion . " well , i do n't know ... maybe . " " you do
[140/1000]	<EOS> " you 're going to be my perfect escape from the world . " " because i do n't think you 've been caught yet . " he was right of course . he should have
[141/1000]	' nothing to worry about , ' said teppic . ' and i will get a thousand crowns worth of gold . ' ' i shall have to do something about the luggage , ' said n ge f
[142/1000]	" you know we will need a long break , then , mr. morgan . you 've made a big mistake in that decision in what do you think ? " i think i know what i think .
[143/1000]	nick groaned under his breath . there had to be something wrong with him . something . there was nothing in his hand , but he knew that something important . i 'm getting them . he 'd seen
[144/1000]	he shrugged . " it is a great waste of money to be keeping people like us back at the white house . " " we do n't need to save people like them , " i insisted
[145/1000]	" the guy who 's getting things into the bedroom ? " " that sounds like the guy , " i say casually . " let me make sure i get everything . i do n't have all
[146/1000]	" yes . or my soul will stop its torture . " " or yours . " the skin on her face split slightly , and tears welled when she saw them . and then she screamed
[147/1000]	he knew better . how could she be in touch with him even if they 'd spoken <EOS> even earlier ? the only thing he cared about , right now was the most important thing . the only thought
[148/1000]	" we 'll see , " she said with a frown , and sighed . " right now i need to get home , " she muttered , then leaned her head against the wall between them . then as
[149/1000]	" i 'll tell them , " she said determinedly . " tomorrow . " with a nod , she vanished into the forest . for a long time , the roar of battle and crashing of weapons was
[150/1000]	and i did . the entire thing . " i like you . like a ton . you 're funny and loyal and i like that , " i said simply . she nodded slowly . her expression was
[151/1000]	he nodded , still keeping a lookout for the van now parked in a distance . " it means i think you need to tell me everything over the phone . tell me what i need to know . "
[152/1000]	i pulled back my knees and rested my arms on them . " listen , what 's going on ? " he stood up , just as the door closed . " my god , you 're just plain
[153/1000]	" let me know when you 're ready for the first run . " " really ? " she asked . she turned for the door and stopped again . " oh , one more thing . "
[154/1000]	" that 's some fucking coffee , is n't it ? " " shut up . " kelly stood up and left , walking to the kitchen door and opening it while she spoke to a confused - looking
[155/1000]	" i really appreciate this , " i said . " i know you 're trying to help me , but it just does n't feel right for me to be so ... concerned . " like i did n't
[156/1000]	" you are the one not allowed to break your vow , " he growled . " just go . now ! " how could a vampire make these kinds of demands ? his chest heaving , he turned
[157/1000]	she thought about that for a minute and then jumped in . " let 's try it . i 'll call my mom . she 's always over here sometimes . " " did you make friends pretty many
[158/1000]	he shifted his attention to me . " look , i can explain it better . i 'm not telling you because you 're not going alone . i need to know i have your full support and will try
[159/1000]	she pressed her face into the phone . " the whole school knows about my pregnancy . " " that 's ... that 's terrible . " " if it was more of a social life opportunity ,
[160/1000]	" so you knew about me . for a week you thought i was your dad ? " " yes . " it explained my questions and how everyone had known about me . i told her about
[161/1000]	he kept himself up by leaning his elbows over the side . " they were here last night before we could get here , " i said . " we 've got someone watching the station , "
[162/1000]	" and she had n't even shown up yet . " " she 's not here . " the words burst from me over the table as i chewed on the words the same way i chewed into the
[163/1000]	" who are we going to ? " " my dad , " she murmured , turning to smile at her daughter as they sat at the coffee table in the living room . that would have to wait
[164/1000]	" stop it . stop it right this minute ! " he yelled . " if you do n't calm down any right now you 're going to have an anxiety attack in the middle of the room , and
[165/1000]	" yes , ma'am . " " we 're fine now , tom . just a few more minutes and the paramedics are next door , " she said . tom nodded and turned back toward the waiting
[166/1000]	" where 's my wife ? " " what 's your name ? " " daniel hamilton . " " we know you 're married , but we 're not looking for a wife . we just
[167/1000]	the three of them raced into the bedroom as we ran through the door . " we have to get out of here , " said dana , holding me close and breathing heavily . " but how
[168/1000]	' ' where ? ' ' ' bout one - ten minutes ' til lunch time . ' a pause ... ' ' okay ' . ' now he just needs to get to the cafeteria , or something
[169/1000]	" i hope we get there in time , " he said . " i do n't want to be trapped in a battle that might never be won . " " do n't worry , i do n't
[170/1000]	she could n't bear the thought of him being used , discarded , or worse ! and what about the money she 'd be spending from her mother ? what about the other things she 'd be having to clean
[171/1000]	" what the fuck , the last time i saw you you were singing you were ... i 'm sorry , " max said . " how did you know ? " he leaned closer and took a
[172/1000]	" you 're going to take your pain out on them , am i right ? " she rolled her eyes . " i 'm afraid you are , your highness , " she spat out without a word
[173/1000]	' do n't tell me how to do it , ' i said very calmly . ' just do it . ' after a couple of seconds of hard - core skepticism she shook her head . ' maybe
[174/1000]	she looks at me , a lot of questions in her eyes . " i 'm going to clean some up <EOS> not eat with my ass * * les ' . " i decide it is time to
[175/1000]	" at least let 's open 'em , then , " he says . " good idea . i was just taking a quick shower . " " that 'd probably be best . " " yeah
[176/1000]	i could n't go back now , and i could n't go to the city . i took her to my boat , and with this she found out that i had made my first fortune in art by
[177/1000]	" yes , you are , " said the shaman sternly as she drew her knees together - obviously preparing to receive a reprimand . " it 's not just that you keep hurting , " said the young
[178/1000]	" but do n't you like me ? " he asked , meeting my eyes with a slight smile . " i - " i struggled for words , " do n't , i mean , do i hate
[179/1000]	" are they here for this ? " " who says it 's here ? " " somebody brought them back here by mistake . " " and you think i 've done something ? " her
[180/1000]	" okay , " i finally replied , " but not here , not right now . " in the sudden silence , he shook his head and replied , " you still are n't going to make me
[181/1000]	" no ma'am . i really am not - " he cuts me off , squeezing my arms so hard , i ca barely breathe . " i am . " " i am not . " oh
[182/1000]	their eyes met . the blue was back , which was a relief . it took some time for them to return to the same level of intimacy . " i can wait as long as you wish . "
[183/1000]	" are you really the son of a bitch who 'd try to take my business away , just like that ? " " i promise . " " then forget it . " " okay .
[184/1000]	" thank you , " she whispered , and turned around to face nate . she reached for his hand , then turned away , letting her back rest against the sofa cushion . " we need to talk .
[185/1000]	" okay , " she said , " i 'll pick you up . " she could tell that he was upset , but because he was worried about her , not about her ; only about being able to
[186/1000]	but he was n't mad like a man who had just been brutally hurt , and he was n't any happier about the prospect of any kind of retribution from sam . " that 's a good question ,
[187/1000]	they arrived at the big open area that jutted up into a steep drop off , the top completely hidden below the trees that lined it with tall evergreen boughs . it reminded him of the mountains he had gone
[188/1000]	" really funny , it is ? and where exactly is here , exactly ? " hollie asked . " well we 've been travelling too many days for something like that to be real . " kate ,
[189/1000]	she ignored him as he took a bite and swallowed . apparently , she was wrong . he said , " i only have a handful of years left to live . i do n't want to be old or
[190/1000]	" get her to bed , " he commanded . my eyes went straight to my mother . she 'd been out of my sight for so long , i had n't really noticed . she was still in
[191/1000]	" my fault for being so careless when you were only four years old , " the young man said , his face white . " how so ? " " i was n't much older than you
[192/1000]	she did n't have her mind made up . still , he hoped things could still be better between them . she was beautiful , amazing , he 'd be damned if he 'd let her be hurt . then
[193/1000]	" i 've never been to the palace before , " lily said . " but once you 've been here and have the word of a regent with a regent you can be back pretty soon . at a
[194/1000]	" you can have anything you want , " i say , " anything at you request . " his mouth curves on one side , a little more friendly as he shakes his head . all my suspicions
[195/1000]	" you would n't , " he stated unequi vocally . " me not doing it , " she said , her voice filled with indignation . " are you telling me you would n't ? "
[196/1000]	" do n't go . " she takes an uncertain step closer to him , still holding his hands by his feet . the sun is warm , but it feels thick and heavy , as if two solid objects
[197/1000]	1 heart 1 legs 1 right 1 <EOS> , 1 closet 1 door 1 car 1 gas 1 half 1 big 1 doors 1 small 1 turned
[198/1000]	" they 've been doing it for years , sir . " " and what 's had them doing it ! " haddington demanded angrily . " it does n't matter , my lord . " said cynthia
[199/1000]	" did she ... ? " i took a deep breath , trying to gather myself . i needed to take some time and have confidence in her , to keep reminding myself that everyone around me would know her
[200/1000]	' we have no further problems , commander , " said bjorn , who had been listening with interest to the conversation . " no , sorry , i did n't mean ... i mean , in my defence
[201/1000]	i have to talk about it . let me tell you , love - you 're not just part of my family . you 're like a sister to us . " " she was a very pretty
[202/1000]	" have them call back , maybe they 'll know more about this . " i frowned as i considered the possibilities . " i do n't like meeting with them when i 'm doing this right , though .
[203/1000]	" that 's why ! you <EOS> really had to fight for a friend for years and god knows how to do that 's all that stuff . it 's not enough ! that 's just how we go about
[204/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " " his brother had a house . some family got in touch . " " his brother ? " " yes , his brother . " " how
[205/1000]	" you call this a car ? " " it 's two years older , so i 'm sure it 's more reliable than a truck . " she pressed a button so her speaker would be down past
[206/1000]	we do n't talk as we turn onto our street . my fingers are in my hair , and even though they 're wet from my shower , i have n't bothered to remove the wig . i do n't
[207/1000]	" you did n't ask you would you ? " i yell . the air smells of hot dog and mustard in the heat . " no , i did n't , " he says . " i went
[208/1000]	" then you 'll have to trust me . do n't do anything that brings up a certain amount of emotional strain . " she paused . " it 's probably nothing . " he took her hand again
[209/1000]	it sounded like an order . " i 'll stay out of your way . " it was a challenge . it made her heart beat faster , made her want him . she would n't allow it
[210/1000]	i found out later when the door buzzer went off a half mile away . " hey people , back ! " it said with a laugh . i opened the door to let in the security guard
[211/1000]	" i do n't care about how he looks . all i care about is destroying him . " at one point , the doctor moved so that his body blocked hers . the nurse , who appeared to
[212/1000]	the sound of his deep voice sent shivers through her . her own breath sped up . she needed to call him back , be alone , but she did n't know what that would accomplish . besides , talking
[213/1000]	" i think i need a drink . " " but - " " thank you , i appreciate it . " she frowned , not liking the sensation in her hips . " but then why
[214/1000]	" i 'm not - " " i know . " she took a step forward and he stepped back , and it felt like she was suffocating . " it 's okay . i 've thought about it
[215/1000]	" no . it 's not , " he said . she realized she was shivering and her jaw started to sweat . just take me outside . what had these people done to him ? " it 's
[216/1000]	" a bit . " she glanced over her shoulder . " is jake all right ? " his gaze followed hers . jake . he was wearing jeans and a t - shirt , making what kind of
[217/1000]	" will , what 's going on ? " i ask around a mouthful of eggs . " i 'm not really sure , " he says in a barely audible voice . " i mean , i knew
[218/1000]	" sorry , " he replied , " i did n't think you 'd take me seriously . you 're always dressed for dates . my opinion really ? to say the least . " i leaned over and
[219/1000]	" the big - time , " she retorted . " i 'm not going to be an overnight guest anymore . i was told to stay by myself only in case they needed it for something serious . "
[220/1000]	she does n't say anything and i can tell my answer is to her . but damn it , the only thing on my mind is that she 's mine and only mine . i smile and lean forward ,
[221/1000]	" my father got home last night after i fell asleep in the hallway and i told him . " " the guy from the hotel ? " " no . him . " " i just
[222/1000]	i smile . it occurs to me that even though he 's very much alive and apparently a wealthy man , he 's also very old , and likely retired , even though i do n't know where he 's
[223/1000]	she heard a rustle now , movement . it sounded as if she sensed her dress being pulled open . she tried to rise up from the mattress , but the covers stopped her . " do n't get
[224/1000]	the last man to speak was a tall and striking young woman who looked exactly like emily - except for her brown eyes - a thin , gaunt face , and straight blonde hair . emily 's legs were crossed
[225/1000]	" oh , " i mumbled , a little shaken . his eyebrows smoothed and his lips curled upward into a grin . " what was that ? " i smiled , but it was genuine . "
[226/1000]	" yeah , yeah . stop talking so much , " i growl . " so we 're done waiting here ? since when ? why ca n't we just go back to pretending that we 're not worried about
[227/1000]	" so that was part of the problem ? you went crazy and attacked one of your brothers ? " " damn straight it was insane . " " that still does n't explain why you did it
[228/1000]	" i brought some water . " " i 'm good ! thank you . " she turned back to her computer . " but the water , " she added , referring to the water fountain . "
[229/1000]	" you get your shit out of here ... and go straight home " , she adds as she sits on the edge of my bed . " you do n't believe me , " i say as i
[230/1000]	her mother appeared at her side . " you are so stubborn ! " celaena stood up . it was the first time they 'd ever been a foot apart . " you know then , i will
[231/1000]	he chuckled , like it was a big joke . " he 's a little bit older than you . and way wiser . " " i 'm still not sure he 's smart enough to look where he
[232/1000]	he looked at me . " you know , you may have made mistakes , but you ca n't have your hopes dashed , " he said , the look in his eyes the unmistakable appeal of one who just
[233/1000]	he was probably right . i needed to find my mother and my friends . * * * * * " how 's your mother ? " nate looked so damn exhausted , but i knew he 'd
[234/1000]	" i 'll do my best . " even though they were n't supposed to talk , he knew that he should go . he knew this was only a stop gap thing . there was no need to
[235/1000]	" that would be excellent , " answered the ambassador . " i have a great deal of work to do . " " i know all that , " assured pryce , " but i really must insist
[236/1000]	the last words just as he reached out and reached for the doorknob , only to find a hard body pressed against his back , his arms around that arm . his heart was racing so quickly he could n't
[237/1000]	because i do n't think she knew . do n't i ? she 'd never been allowed to know . " all the things i want ? " she asked , and she could n't keep the
[238/1000]	well , i 've got some good cooking cooking practice myself . " he laughed , the sound was rich , and my stomach did one quick , tight knot . " me , too . " the
[239/1000]	" the ones i got you are different , " he said . " why ? " " i do n't know how to tell you this about myself , but i 'll try anyway . you 'll
[240/1000]	" this will only take a second , " a deep male voice filled the phone . " the two of you have been in this house three days , or else i would have called you as soon as
[241/1000]	her mother 's eyes widened . " i think your hair 's going to come out of the tie , " she said . " unless i can go in the living room and turn it back . "
[242/1000]	" of course , milord . " the master was very sorry . it was never a good idea to upset the master . " put the girl down and bring them up from the bottom of the stairs
[243/1000]	he did n't need her help putting on jeans and a jumper . " i do n't think the twins are the only threat you 've probably given in the last week . " " me ? i
[244/1000]	what had they said before ? this had something to do with her father , she suspected . he was n't just a man ; he was a genius , a genius ... one that defied all logic and logic
[245/1000]	" we 're <EOS> we like the two of them . " with me the next day . that seemed like a safe combination , so long as they did n't make a big one . they could n't do
[246/1000]	now i remember , when he helped me lift the baby to his lap . " that 's it , that 's it , " he continued . " now , i know the girl is yours , that you
[247/1000]	it was n't me he was after . he 'd get to my family first . he was a real ass * * le . " you look great , " i told him . " so do
[248/1000]	she shook her head , tears forming as she blinked them back . " no , it wo n't hurt . " " then how are you here ? " he queried , not certain she could talk .
[249/1000]	" my brother 's job ? " grace asked . grace seemed to be looking at her , but he could n't see anything out of the ordinary . as people could often manage , kyle took that for
[250/1000]	" oh , yes , " he said . " i am . now you are . " he took a step toward her . she felt like a statue , and the ground tilted beneath her feet .
[251/1000]	" when will you go ? " " when you decide , the minute are decided . " " thank you , " charlie whispered . she turned and went to join the others on the stairs .
[252/1000]	" never trust men from good families , i found out . many must be bribed to take a job with the very man they are to put the job in a person 's keeping . " ' she
[253/1000]	" one of our own was killed back in the eighties . he was the director of an institute that protected people . he was a monster . " " not necessarily , " said the tall man .
[254/1000]	suddenly the next ship came in . it flew in low , and looked like a boat ; on the deck , a sailor named jim said that the other ship had the same flag as the last , but
[255/1000]	i can still hear the old man 's voice , the one that seemed to be whispering to me in my dreams for more than a year . i 'm scared , i say to mom and dad .
[256/1000]	' come away . please . ' her breath caught when he drew himself up on his elbow . ' it 's over ? ' his eyebrow quirked . ' oh , no . i 'm very happy
[257/1000]	the nurse finished his examination , then walked back to the hospital room , looking a little pale . to judge harry bain , it seemed miraculous that , at a time when the building had been so busy
[258/1000]	" what , exactly , are you hoping for ? " " nothing ... more than a lot of things . " she had a wicked idea and needed his help to solve it . for some reason ,
[259/1000]	her blood raced through her veins . blood ... and hunger . the scent of roses filled the air . a flower in the moonlight . her chest heaved with a deep breath . then maya drew one
[260/1000]	and you know that 's what i 'll do now . i 'm not leaving . i wo n't even try . it is what it should be . " i saw the note on the kitchen table last
[261/1000]	as the men passed , her body suddenly became harder , more insistent , like being turned on by a hot , heavy body . he would n't stop moving until he reached her . but then she
[262/1000]	" i ca n't believe it 's you and that guy , " jo said when he offered her a drink . " we 're friends , " he assured her . " friends . " she peered
[263/1000]	<EOS> looking like you ... thinking of those long legs . just like the rest of you , and not for the first time . just like me ... i have never wanted to fall asleep like this in
[264/1000]	the pain was n't entirely gone . it seemed to have receded a smi d gen , leaving an undeniable sensation of self - consciousness . " how did you do this ? " she asked , gazing up
[265/1000]	she grabbed her towel , tossed it across her lap , and climbed out of the pool . getting out of the damp - the cold water dripping down her body , and soaking her ni * * les -
[266/1000]	as the lights dimmed , the music started . " i 'm gon na play a song for you it 's called , the lady of the night . " the band started to play . " i
[267/1000]	" are you sure ? " i glance up <EOS> ... looking out the empty driveway , knowing that when he speaks to me , as he drives , watching me , the way he made my entire life .
[268/1000]	" this is how the business is arranged . when we are at the warehouse , you will take a code red marker and code three and just read from the code red to make it clear that there is
[269/1000]	" do you want to go ? " i asked , looking directly into his gaze . i could feel myself shaking . " do you really want to do it ? " his shoulders relaxed a bit ,
[270/1000]	and then you say that you want me to trust you , because you 're not really trying . i have to wonder . ethan 's father has n't done anything to break her . did n't try
[271/1000]	" my lord , i 'm truly distressed . " she smoothed her dress with one hand , pushing it aside to reveal a hand that was bare of a ring . as one does when in a great excitement
[272/1000]	the two of them faced away from each other , and she could see his eyes were blank with worry . " are you okay ? " grace repeated . he nodded . it seemed to olivia that
[273/1000]	from the shadows behind the desk , a soldier appeared . <EOS> he had seen before but had yet seen from afar . these creatures grew darker with every approaching step . the soldier , clad in black ,
[274/1000]	the three of them wandered away from the cave , going back a few steps , stopping in the sand . suddenly , the sun began to set . behind them , the dark shapes of the two men disappeared
[275/1000]	i stopped myself <EOS> ' f * * d , i tried to take the rest of the song for a second . i 'd left and used the right . while in my head i did the chant of
[276/1000]	" so i have an excuse to make you jealous ? " i asked . " what do n't you like about me ? " " you are nice , " nick said . " you are sweet .
[277/1000]	" i thought that you might be concerned about my sister . " alex stiffened and looked down at the table , avoiding his eye contact . she could feel a blush burning her cheeks , and if the
[278/1000]	" yes , mother , " i answer . even though i 'm pretty sure that is n't what everyone was talking about . i 'm sure that whatever was said on this mission wo n't be repeated .
[279/1000]	" is he there , then ? where is he ? " she finally demanded . " on the other side of the room , " she replied . she walked carefully over to where the boy sat
[280/1000]	as the plane rose and dipped , nick realized he probably would n't be flying at all , but at least he 'd actually been paying attention . on this trip through the south pacific , a man was always
[281/1000]	his mouth quirked to the side . " i think that 's good news , " i said . " more than good . " he squeezed my hand . we stayed together between the two beds
[282/1000]	" it 's a shame they are n't our own . they look so innocent , " ra th ven said . " just one child running wild . " she made a noncommittal gesture with her hands , like
[283/1000]	" sure , no problem . " the big , dark - haired man did n't smile . i made as if to walk away , but he reached for my arm . i jerked back .
[284/1000]	" thank you . i 'm glad to know i can help you , but i have no obligation to go any further right this moment . " she held out a hand to hug my shoulder . "
[285/1000]	" what are you doing ? " i asked as he set it down on the couch . " i 'm giving you a chance to put together a case . you were with me at vincent 's party
[286/1000]	" you 've said that before . a lot of times . you want me to love you any way i can ... " " do n't you think i 've asked you that ? " he kissed
[287/1000]	" let 's worry about that another time , " she said . " can we get to the important thing now ? before i die . " " oh , right . " " if you had
[288/1000]	" let 's find her , " he said . " i 'd love to get a look at the baby so i can see how she 's doing . " " what has the doctor said to you
[289/1000]	" because it 's not my fault i 'm a woman . " that was a little bit harsh . his jaw clenched but he did n't say anything . instead he leaned toward her and said , "
[290/1000]	" he 's not dead , " i told him , watching the tears fall down his face . " he 's fine . do n't worry . " he started to move closer , but i placed a
[291/1000]	" oh , " i said . " do tell . " " and i still have some bad news . " i narrowed my eyes . he sighed . " i think we have started a
[292/1000]	i ran my fingers up her neck , letting them dip under her skin . she sucked in a breath and sucked on my bottom lip . " what do you mean , do you want to see me naked
[293/1000]	i do n't respond to him , but my gut twist anyway . it 's killing me that he should be able to see me that way . " tell me what happened , " he says .
[294/1000]	" what 's that supposed to mean ? " michael 's face was furious , and i started to feel alarmed myself . " what do you mean you ca n't touch him ? " " i ca n't
[295/1000]	" the prince . the man i came to see . it 's a long story . " he continued , not offering an explanation . he was waiting for her to say something but she did not . "
[296/1000]	" oh my gosh . i 've never wanted to date anyone more than i do now . " she blushed when she revealed the real reason for her visit . normally when she did come back , she went
[297/1000]	" is the woman named anya ? " " yes , the innkeeper 's daughter . " " did she live here at the fortress ? " " there is a lady of learning in the valley
[298/1000]	" but i ca n't be sure if someone 's faking . in this case i 'm convinced . " she met his gaze squarely . " of course you can be sure . but you ca n't take
[299/1000]	" you should n't have gone to the party , " he says . " it was n't really a party , " i say . " you look pale . " i look at the man
[300/1000]	" it does more than that , " he murmured , his voice hoarse with desire , which drove his body into hers all the more . " it 's you , my wife . i wo n't let it

[303/1000]	the captain did n't know why , or why , but he found himself smiling . it was n't just gratitude for all he 'd done for his people ; it was the freedom to have fun without having to
[304/1000]	he continued his story . " the first time lara fired her first gun , her first gun , was near the end of her last shift at the fire station . she was tired and scared , and
[305/1000]	" that 's why i 'm telling you to stay away from him , " he said adamantly . " he has n't had the best reputation , and without even getting him into rehab , that idiot had the
[306/1000]	" the girl from the store ? those are n't the two i saw , were they ? " " those were the ones you smelled when you took a first sip . " i 'm vaguely aware
[307/1000]	" well , there you go . " his eyebrows raised in question . " you just said that ... " " what ? " his grin and deep chuckle were his answer . " it actually
[308/1000]	" all right , my darling ! " mrs. pot ts exclaimed , after she had closed it for the night . she opened the shutters again , so that the room was bright with daylight , and rummaged under
[309/1000]	" me too . as a matter of fact , i 'd like to meet him - perhaps a visit for all his wonderful qualities . i remember how fun he must have been when he was alive ! "
[310/1000]	' you want me to ? we 'll get another beer . this one . a double , please . ' i got up and saw the water , and his gaze followed me . he was wearing a
[311/1000]	" please tell me you 're not going out with him , " i say . " nope . you 're screwed . " " so who ? " " so who 's the hottie ? "
[312/1000]	" no , i wanted to show you the way to my room , " she told me . " at a moment 's notice ? " " i just wanted to see if you wanted to come
[313/1000]	" but he must get some way to make a new hand , " said gandalf . " it is a mystery . " " well , there is still the master of the ring , but you may
[314/1000]	i laughed softly . " okay . i think that was his intent . " " good , then i was done for . i 'll see you . " he jumped off the plane . " i 'll
[315/1000]	" no . you are not . " she was silent for another long moment . " how long do you think this will take ? " " as much as it takes , i think i shall be
[316/1000]	" oh , thank goodness ! now we could get out of this ... " and she pulled me closer and kissed me on the cheek . " you were right , you never listened , " she whispered
[317/1000]	the small room we entered seemed to swell in size . the walls were hung with several paintings and wall carvings from around the world . there were pictures on the wall , too , but my eyes were only
[318/1000]	" no one but the man who sent me , " replied the stranger dryly in an arrogant tone . his eyes were cold and his stance no longer confident and even a tad too sure of himself .
[319/1000]	" uh , sure . " ben kept his stare steady on me . " hey , ben . " " ben . " " great and all that . " " uh , you 'll
[320/1000]	they both smiled as they waited for the waitress to return to the table , as the three friends held tight onto each other , and drank their first real beer in years . though the first one was vodka
[321/1000]	" that would be a relief , " he chuckles . " it would be an excuse to see you have some fun . " his eyes rake over me in the mirror as if he was just caught me
[322/1000]	" we 've known each other too long for that , " i said . " our first meeting was at one of the clubs in town . one i usually stay at alone . " her eyes
[323/1000]	he took me over to the table and had me eat several cookies , and then he asked the men to go clean up . " you stay here and clean up . i 'll keep your horses safe .
[324/1000]	" no , " she said gently . he pulled out of her and then sat on his legs . ' and that 's where i want to be , " he said with a devilish grin .
[325/1000]	i 've known people , but this is nuts ; there 's no way . she 's not some psycho who will break your heart if given the chance , and she certainly would n't hurt me . her face
[326/1000]	in a moment of wild panic , he realised the last time he 'd done that . the door had n't been locked during his time in the dungeon . not out here . and he 'd been the one
[327/1000]	" wow . if only you could be more like me ... " " i 'm getting there . " although , deep down ? i was n't so sure i was done yet . the next few
[328/1000]	" i 'm beginning to think our situation is never going to get better , " the guy continued reading from the pages in front of him . " you have to admit , this is one of the better
[329/1000]	" do you think i 'm some type of criminal ? " asked mr. marlin , staring blankly at bob . " who cares ? " said mr. marlin . " after all , i 've killed you !
[330/1000]	' i 'll be fine , thanks . thanks . ' ' i 'll see you tomorrow . ' she said goodbye , and i thanked him with every bit of my energy i still owned , and
[331/1000]	" oh ? " " oh . i saw it in the news about you , and i was sure , if you read about it in the newspaper , it 'd only be a rumor if you read
[332/1000]	" i 'm out of here , " his mother cried , then quickly turned and raced out of the house . " why , mom ? " she did n't answer . cole stared at the
[333/1000]	" not in the physical sense . i only have good memories , that 's a human thing . " " i do n't have to hear you say those words , <EOS> at least . " he
[334/1000]	i stared down at the door , debating on whether or not to go back to the room , but instead i walked across the room and pushed open the door . it was a small room , just
[335/1000]	" i am my own man , " i repeated , though now he was getting on my nerves . " that is kind of a tall order , is n't it ? " as if to illustrate his
[336/1000]	" the whole party was just a round of jokes at once , " the judge said . " they were all too excited for their own good . " " that 's an understatement , doctor - san

[339/1000]	but it looks like they have a great view . one of those huge buildings is an oil painting of a horse - drawn carriage but does n't look all that stable - where <EOS> - it looks pretty damn
[340/1000]	as if this could help her , he dropped his hand from her waist . ' you are not going to make it through the week without seeing those photos , are you ? ' ' only if i
[341/1000]	he rubbed the back of his neck , his whole body pulsing with tension . he was so close to giving in . he would give in to the temptation . " do you really think you can stay
[342/1000]	i followed her nose and took in the sights . " i have a garden ? " " yes , in the back . there 's a path and an air conditioning unit in it . "
[343/1000]	that brought back all the questions i 'd wanted to ask - and none of them had any answers . i was the one who saw to that . i was the one who ended that night .
[344/1000]	" who ? " she gasped . " the black dragon , " i said . she smiled and did n't say anything . " i 'm sorry , " i said . " i did n't
[345/1000]	" i just - " i was about to finish telling her , but her eyes were closed . " do n't keep anything from me . i 'm not that naïve , piper . " " i 'm
[346/1000]	" i 'm okay even with how much i know . " " i will make sure you do n't lose that privilege . " " thank you . " she smiled , but the smile turned to
[347/1000]	the man 's name was joe . joe was six feet tall , with skin as pale as glass and eyes as bright as sapphires . he had a body of honed muscle and a strong jawline . those
[348/1000]	" i did n't know you could talk , " he says and starts laughing , shaking his arm at me . good . i did n't realize that i was so vocal until then . i feel him come
[349/1000]	" you 're not going to give my word , " she said , before running out of the room . i sat up in bed , looking at her pale face . so fragile , even in sleep .
[350/1000]	he looked down at her , his fingers cupping her face . " are you sure , elle ? i would never want you to be alone , " he murmured . she nodded , her eyelids fluttering shut
[351/1000]	i 've never told anyone at this point that i was not expecting it . that i was more than a little nervous , and nervous is the first response i can find . i 'm not , i
[352/1000]	" i want you so bad . please do n't make me beg for you . " that smile never faltered . " i hope i 'm not here to hurt you . " it was the truth
[353/1000]	" oh , he might . i have to take a look . i doubt how he would cope if i just walked in without knocking . " she glanced down at the alarm clock and gasped at what
[354/1000]	he 's my father . my muscles begin to shake . " i just want to say how sorry i am . we can talk about this at my hotel . " " yes , mr. stark
[355/1000]	" if there was a time to lose me and to get paid to do it , your mother would have kicked me out early . " " maybe you were the only one who put up a fight
[356/1000]	" oh no , you do n't , " she ordered me . " you do n't get to tell me anything , either . so you can find yourself a new boyfriend if you want , but you will
[357/1000]	" what is with you ? " i pull her close and bury a kiss in her neck . " you 're so fucking cold . " her arms are around my neck , keeping me tucked close to her
[358/1000]	why , hello , my name is will , i am the assistant district attorney assigned to the case for the district attorney 's office but i am not affili ated as the district attorney . how long have you
[359/1000]	" i do n't need to . his son ? " she started to tear the dress off her shoulders , but i set it gently aside and forced her to sit down on the bed . " yes
[360/1000]	she frowned . " what on earth for ? i did n't give you a clue where he was . " " i followed him to arizona last night . " " why ? " " i
[361/1000]	" the black legion has a legion . we can not go against him in battle , " said ridmark , making certain the warden 's attention was on him rather than the sword . " he is not a
[362/1000]	" hello , " she answered . he asked her for his number . later she gave him time to reconsider . later , she did n't care which she gave him . then , he answered when he got
[363/1000]	the only thing she had in common with him was that she was younger and had always behaved as a child , having no idea of the kind of life that awaited her . " oh , i would
[364/1000]	" oh , " she said as if she was surprised . " i was just on my trip . on my way to the coffee shop in town . " she was the least of my problems now
[365/1000]	" hi , my name is dr. k ear ney . i 'm here to see your daughter , " he said , bending to look out the window . " i understand there have been , after all ,
[366/1000]	" i mean to do . " his breath blows against my core . i drop my head so i can push my damp hair out of my face . " i want things to be different for us .
[367/1000]	that had n't seemed especially relevant on the way to the city centre . the only thing she 'd expected at the cathedral in paris was a busy sunday morning in the high street corner . and when she
[368/1000]	i look down at the ground . i look up at him , at the expression on his face . i feel too scared to even talk . " let 's take a walk , " i say ,
[369/1000]	" now i hear you - <EOS> just call ... i 'll just call ... i had to see you . i had to tell you i was a vampire - i had to try and save your life .
[370/1000]	i almost let out a sob when jason returned with the pizza and placed it on the table as we watched it die . no , i thought . chapter seven heven it was just after
[371/1000]	" i 've heard of that . " " people make it seem so easy . like everyone 's so very good on the show . " julie laughed . " maybe . maybe i was just being
[372/1000]	" if you choose to , then i 'll wait and i 'd like to meet the women in the clan . but the king tells me he 's never done a human - female mating contract with them .
[373/1000]	" for good measure , i 'll go after these two . " i pushed the point of her knife at one of the vampires . it grazed and pierced the side of his neck . the vampire hissed in
[374/1000]	" go , " i said . " i will finish up here . " just as i stood , two more men appeared from a side entrance and grabbed me from behind . one pulled a knife from
[375/1000]	" that 's what it sounds like . now let me go in , and you know what you are going to do . " i nodded . " fine , " i mumbled , " i hope you
[376/1000]	he pulled them on without taking his eyes off me and took a few steps to the edge of the dance floor . we were just standing there , looking at each other when he spoke . " i
[377/1000]	" yeah , of course , " said a distant , familiar voice . " are you all right ? " he asked , as she stopped halfway . she had walked around to the back of the
[378/1000]	chapter 13 james was back . he would return soon as the sun was starting to set and hope that it had n't gone too far , that he could get through the night safely . what would
[379/1000]	" then you 're going to think of stuff for a good while ... " his voice broke and his eyes went wet . " i know how that sounds , but you 'll see . you 'll find out
[380/1000]	" then what was that song about ? " a small voice inquired from behind me . i spun round expecting to see someone standing there with tears in their eyes . i was in a dark blue jacket and
[381/1000]	" i 'm sorry i did n't figure it out sooner . " his eyes narrowed . " what about it ? " " i thought you wanted someone to give it to you when you were done
[382/1000]	" you 're here again ! " " no ! " " liar ! " she yelled , pounding her fist on her dresser . " you 'd never leave me to deal with another jerk like him
[383/1000]	" all right . " he looked at her gratefully . " thanks for telling me your story . it means a lot to me that you have n't told anyone else . " " not to anyone else
[384/1000]	he nodded . if an object were in his area , it would eventually become a part of him , if he was quick enough to recover it . he closed the box and replaced it . " do
[385/1000]	" just get out . " he said the last bit with a firm shake of his head . " for the record ? i 'm afraid i 'd be in big trouble if she says , ' i
[386/1000]	the look on his face changed dramatically . a look of complete shock and disbelief was mirrored by the pained expression on his face . his eyes were wider than i 'd ever seen them before . with a gasp
[387/1000]	" you 're really good at what you do , " i said , reaching for a bottle of champagne . " you would n't know , but thanks . " " when i see you tomorrow ?
[388/1000]	he knew what he was doing . the man was not looking at the sky from his side , but at the ground . he got out of his car and started to look up at the clouds . then
[389/1000]	it took him three days . he saw nothing of his brother , who had been a great friend of his father . if anything the words made him miss him all the more . so much was different
[390/1000]	" what ? " she tried to move to help him but he shook her off . " i 'm going to clean up the mess . " he scooped her up inside his arms and carried her
[391/1000]	his hand lifted and splayed , gliding over her stomach and then down . his knuckles pressed into her . he stroked them until she was dizzy , and then he stroked up the inside of her thighs , caressing
[392/1000]	but why go into battle when no one knew how to fight ? she pulled in a deep breath , trying to calm herself . with him right there in front of her , everything was so damn surreal .
[393/1000]	a woman at the front desk told me i had to make two dollars an hour and i headed out to a different table and bought a dozen of cigarettes and two of three boxes of camels . i waited
[394/1000]	that you 'd find a way to call to you twice in the same day ... what was i thinking ? i ... " shit ! " i cursed quietly , dropping the phone back onto the table .
[395/1000]	" i did n't make this trip to see her in an hour but once i 'm back i 'll make sure to fly with you . " " she was with us for - " " time
[396/1000]	instead , he said , " let 's go for a walk . " she did n't argue , and he was right . it was still cold with no sunshine . as she let him lead her out
[397/1000]	and then he was falling forwards , falling towards an indeterminate distance , a world he could n't even begin to name , that was only dimly familiar to him , that was only distantly alive he could use to
[398/1000]	" i 'm serious about being with mia . " she started to cry all over again , and i just sat there in silence , holding her with her head in my lap . after a few
[399/1000]	" we knew she was there , " said a woman 's voice . " the guy with the gun did . " connor glanced over his shoulder . " she shot him . " way to use the
[400/1000]	" and now ? " " now your ass and i will be in a couple of states in a few months and then we 'll move the rest to ohio . " " your ass and mine
[401/1000]	" this is a small town . " she smiled . " have a seat and i 'll get myself something to drink . " i sat the letter on the table , and sat next to her as
[402/1000]	" i 'm not the one with the gun , " the girl answered . beth had n't even heard the creature make its move , but beth saw the creature before she could react , the big creature
[403/1000]	" god knows how old she is . does n't she know that 's not even a person ? " " and her father , " i say . " well she has a father , " says
[404/1000]	the first thing she does before she walks through the door is reach for her hand and place it on my forearm before she starts her walk - in closet . " hi , ben . " she sounds
[405/1000]	" sure , " i said . " i want him to know that . " " <EOS> ... ? " she said , she 'd been watching . " okay . " " okay . "
[406/1000]	' you did n't tell me about this , ' said the doctor . ' you did n't tell me about this . ' ' yes sir , ' said angelina , swallowing hard and trying her best to
[407/1000]	" sorry , " he said . " i woke up in the middle of the night and could n't get my bearings . " she studied him some more . " it 's possible you were dreaming about
[408/1000]	the man dropped down beside her . he did n't seem to notice that her cheeks were flushed . " i did n't mean to - " " i know you did n't , " he cut her
[409/1000]	" it 's obvious . what would a man like that know about you ? nothing . " " so ? " he barked . " you think he 'd do such a thing ? " i shook
[410/1000]	but he was on one side of it now , the rest of us were on the other . he would walk , too . where he came from , people did n't stand in the kitchen doorway , not
[411/1000]	his voice was ragged . " this is true . " why was he hesitating ? " i 'll go . " " no . " he shook his head . " you stay with me . "
[412/1000]	i went back to my bedroom and dug through my clothes . i found the last one that i was going to wash . i sat on my comforter , wrapped myself in it , and decided the time had
[413/1000]	my ears perked , and i focused on the line in front of me , watching for the man i 'd seen the night before . everyone else in the room had gone quiet , waiting on my response .
[414/1000]	i 'd heard about a great band in the area , a family that used to live in philadelphia , and that was where i thought they were now . we asked around and got a place in the city
[415/1000]	" like the car and house , like the truck and the house . have you found out if you 've seen any of the items left over from that old trailer in your back yard ? " he asked
[416/1000]	sam glanced back at the guy . " i 'm not an open book , i can appreciate information , but the last thing i want to do is piss off the wrong person . " sam walked around
[417/1000]	chapter 4 twenty minutes later , there was a knock on the door of one of the office 's two upstairs rooms . when i opened the door there was nothing in the room but a desk filled with
[418/1000]	he tried another tack . " he 's got it already , " he declared . " no , he does n't . well , he might have had it when he was a cop , but he was
[419/1000]	he watched me in silence , his face drawn and worn . i tried to make my own eyes burn . that felt impossible . " do n't you see ? you have to tell us who my
[420/1000]	the sky outside was a deep , deep blue and blue as there was no pollution to tell the difference between the pale pastel blue of the eastern sky and the pure white of the eastern ocean . the sound
[421/1000]	" i understand . " i want to look at her , but all i can do is hold on to her hand , but then she lowers it . " i know we 'll be good together ,
[422/1000]	we had not planned you to be killed . we must have thought you might get away while everything was being done . " that is true . for quite a while we tried to have that last
[423/1000]	she snorted . " that was n't funny at all . " he did n't laugh . he seemed uncomfortable . then he looked down to the floor . " so , you finally know - " he began
[424/1000]	i swallowed . " if you do n't , i 'll give you something else . " she opened her mouth to protest , but i did n't think she was capable of that . it was probably because
[425/1000]	" we do n't do things on our terms , " he said firmly . " does n't matter ! it 's for their benefit ! " " i disagree . if anyone in my family wants to
[426/1000]	" fine , " mark said . " do you need a hand with that ? you could n't have helped me with the trash while i was here last time . " " no , that 's all
[427/1000]	" she was n't aware that he had a talent , " said hugh . " but he spoke about it . he gave a description of such a character . i did n't dare tell her he was an
[428/1000]	another smile . " i 'm sorry i took so long . i had to go back to the states anyway to pick up another woman . guess you were in a hurry and i was going to take the
[429/1000]	now it 's mine . it 's all mine . i love him . all my heart s capes . my love . " are you crazy ? " he calls back , running his fingers back through
[430/1000]	so in the morning , when the sun was almost down , they 'd started walking north . " you do n't have to walk around this place all night , " she said . " i do
[431/1000]	" this is your car and everything that you had gotten you ? " " you saw my car ? seriously ? that 's not fair . " " i do n't think you understand enough of our
[432/1000]	he 's not <EOS> <EOS> the way i 'll be okay with that . you 're just supposed to pull it together every chance you 've got . i wish you were still here . and then i hear
[433/1000]	" but we have no proof . we still do n't know where to look , that 's not what i 'd do . " " why are you wasting your time ? maybe you did something to cause
[434/1000]	" i was planning on telling her that i 've been practicing , " he said , and they talked until midnight . in the beginning , the room was too cold , but that was no excuse for the
[435/1000]	" and you do n't ? how 's that possible from you being here ? " " because he told me i would n't see him or get involved or have any kind of relationship with ... any of
[436/1000]	" i 'm going to get your name , " i said , my body and mind coming together . it was too much , too fast . my whole world , which had just been falling apart at the
[437/1000]	" it 's okay . let go . " " i 'm sorry , i ca n't . " she gasped in outrage . " look . " the back of her hand wiped away a tear
[438/1000]	" are you talking to me ? " " not really , i ca n't breathe right , " she said sitting up suddenly . " i guess you could say i 'm feeling a bit off . i
[439/1000]	but she was as good as her word . first , we moved into a nice little hotel , not too much of a hotel . i kept up a steady pressure on the brakes , while i kept an
[440/1000]	" how did you die ? what happened ? " " i can talk to you over there , " i tell him , and start to move up beside him like i was planned . the problem is
[441/1000]	" well , now you know what to expect . " i 'm still smiling in anticipation when i hear the elevator open . i glance around , checking the small area to make sure there are n't
[442/1000]	" do n't touch me , you crazy - ass girl . " i said , glaring at her face from afar as the wind blew my hair around and ruffled it in front . i wondered how many times
[443/1000]	" do n't you think he 'd rather have people around ? " " very funny and shut up . " she pressed a hand to her forehead , but i could n't help but laugh . " hey
[444/1000]	" so , there you are , " said the man he had been talking to . " i am ? " asked bates . " yeah . come on . i want to show you something .
[445/1000]	she stepped forward , and the man on the bench looked up at her with his half - open mouth . through the gap in the wooden fence , she could see the blood leaking out of it as it
[446/1000]	" it 's an empty house . i 'm sorry , i wish you could visit , but as of now you are one of us and are not allowed passage . " " do you really think so
[447/1000]	" ' tis a wonderful surprise to see you , " he said , " indeed i 'm terribly sorry about how we left things . i 'd like to send you letters , if you 'll allow that .
[448/1000]	james looked back at the ship , slowly returning to his previous position to find his men watching him with curiosity . " what ? " james said . " what 's wrong with the ship ? "
[449/1000]	" yeah , i 'd have to agree with that , " he said with a smirk . " it 's fine for me , though . i 'll try not to ruin your reputation anymore . "
[450/1000]	" you just called my name ... " " it 's you ... " i whispered , feeling my throat close up at the sound of his deep voice . he took my shirt off then stepped back
[451/1000]	" there are n't a lot of people to live on . nobody on your planet would eat them . " " in your planet we have several thousand workers . if it would n't give most of us
[452/1000]	now , you 're talking . " so many emotions raged inside him - his relief that she was right in front , his rage that she 'd left his side , and most of all , his joy that
[453/1000]	" i have been reading it last week , and now you have finally convinced me . it 's an interesting thing . i was sure at the club you 'd want me to accept one of your new friends
[454/1000]	" he 's the only one who really gave it to me . " " he 's a fucking loser , " jake says . " would you stop talking about my brother like that ? " it
[455/1000]	" why not ? " i was stunned . " never you mind . " she dropped her cell on the table and grabbed my elbow , steering me toward the couch when " the girls " arrived .
[456/1000]	" oh . thank god . are you still with him ? " " yes , he 's still here in town . " " do we need to come back and get him ? " "
[457/1000]	he opened the envelope , and as he did so , he did not take out a gun . never leave a gun with a man . maybe he had seen this on tv . or maybe he had just
[458/1000]	" i did not expect to find out that you were in san francisco . " " i have n't been . i figured maybe i could catch a flight here for the next five years or so .
[459/1000]	where could she find the rest of them ? on the other end of the line , there was a slight delay . " hello ? this is sarah . i 'll be in town over the weekend
[460/1000]	" not as much as you seem to think . " i knew my response would be something defensive , which was for the best . it was n't like she had ever cared much about my feelings .
[461/1000]	i had n't told that story to anyone before . no one , but maybe not one of my classmates , really trusted me , thought that i had anything to do with what happened , or wanted to believe
[462/1000]	" what i 'd like you to do is show me where you keep the keys . i know the place and i 'll give you something to show me where you 're keeping them . the only people on
[463/1000]	" the thing is , we are in the dead of night so we are not really used to it . " " well , that is our problem . i just wish i had a book to read
[464/1000]	the idea made me want to laugh , in spite of my concerns for quinn 's safety . considering every single other man that had been in the same room with me the first time , i would n't mind
[465/1000]	" yes . but you ca n't put that in . you have to wait until i can figure out you 're not lying . that 's your business . " she took another sip of coffee and eyed
[466/1000]	a wave of panic overtook me . " my dad is about to have one , " i said in a high voice . " i know , honey , i heard you . " " what the
[467/1000]	his jaw clenched . " i 'm really not in the mood to argue right now , you know . " she shook her head . a tremor of her blond hair slid over her shoulders . they stared
[468/1000]	" and you must rest . if you were not certain , you had no man to accompany you . " sarah 's gaze moved once again to her mother 's face , her eyes wide . when she
[469/1000]	they 'd traveled as far as the border of the border lands after going to the western pass when the weather had become almost unbearable . without trees following them , it got muggy on horseback ; fortunately the horses
[470/1000]	i give a quick glance toward the street clock , which is showing 4: 15 on the dot , and say , " yeah , it 's eleven , but that does n't give us it . " "
[471/1000]	the next time grace saw the baby for the first time , the woman had taken her by the shoulders and dragged her around . the baby was about <EOS> so tiny that grace wondered whether she must be the
[472/1000]	when she finally glanced up , he gave her a smile that was full of promise . she would have returned it with more fervor , but she was stunned to see how tired and haggard he looked .
[473/1000]	i do n't know how to end it . i want to be that guy again . the player who 's going to take what he wants , not the hero that my body wants . instead , i just
[474/1000]	i leaned slowly back , trying to focus my concentration on the road . " yes . she 's on a mission to find the missing leader of the alphas . we 're searching for her . if i find
[475/1000]	what the hell 's up with this ? " i do n't know , sam . " she does n't sound like she believes herself . i turn to face her . " i 'm not asking you
[476/1000]	" no , i did n't mean that . " he shook his head , looking confused . " i just mean , one night they came over to look at my new piano . then my uncle came outside
[477/1000]	" do n't leave , " i commanded . " i do n't even know your name , what kind of man you are , what kind of man you are , how you run what i do . all
[478/1000]	his lips twisted into a wry smile . " so you think this is easy for me to say ? " she glared at him . " and you thought i was your girl ? " " no
[479/1000]	" we 're here . " they got out of the taxi , a little more confident now . he did n't mind at all , for all things were possible . chapter 58 the office space
[480/1000]	well , there 's no question . it 's not that i do n't wish to talk to my father about that thing with the shadow , but i did n't see anyone else out there who would .
[481/1000]	" i am . " she was stunned speechless . " you ... i do n't understand , " she said . " i 've never done anything like this before , " he said .
[482/1000]	" we 'll see , " replied the older vampire , rising . " take this . " he slid a piece of wood into her hand . " i think you 'll find it works just fine . "
[483/1000]	i put on my sneakers and my sweater . " we could leave town if we want , " i suggested . he shook his head . " of course not . " he gave me his lazy
[484/1000]	" you know , i think you are right . i have n't thought about how much this will impact , and it 's really an amazing thing - an amazing combination - to realize what a person truly means
[485/1000]	her face remained stoic . she did n't look at him . just a million thoughts rushed through her brain . she did n't want to be here . she did n't want to talk to him . the entire
[486/1000]	" i know it 's over now . i do n't see the point in trying to rebuild . it 'll be as easy as finding a new home while we 're here . but i want to try .
[487/1000]	i heard another growl in the darkness and the back of my neck shivered . i did n't know if the demon was the one who 'd escaped , but it was hard to say with the sound of heavy
[488/1000]	she nodded , holding up the folder . " good . good . so about this week , we will have a wedding . you 'll stay at my house . i can go down on you . at
[489/1000]	" does he bite ? " i asked , staring at the line in question . " at least once a month . it happens in this room , not to me , because if he does , he
[490/1000]	" ah , come on , " he cajoled . " it 's obvious you wo n't stop . " " no , i wo n't , " i said emphatically . " i 'll work on my speech
[491/1000]	' they already know the truth . they will follow you if you do n't tell them soon enough , ' he said , with conviction ; and before the teacher could give an answer , in a voice which
[492/1000]	" hey , " he said , lifting my hands to keep them from roaming over his body . " are you okay ? " i 'd been the one to talk her into staying , but she was
[493/1000]	" <EOS> " to the boy 's body , one look at this , these people to try and cure another 's sickness . , his mother 's face appears in his mind . i wish things had
[494/1000]	" right , " the dean said . " i just talked to your father about the matter . i could n't bring myself to do it . " " why ? " she was still trying to catch
[495/1000]	' with ease , my lord . ' ' you 're always the most helpful . ' ' a man can make such good progress , my lord . ' ' there 's a reason such people
[496/1000]	she was still shaking her head at me , hands on her hips , when i walked up behind her and wrapped my arms around her . he pulled open the door , grabbed my wallet and gun and then
[497/1000]	" you are not a coward the prince was about to make you , but as you have grown a bit taller and you will , you will survive , " advised the leader of the scouts as he grabbed
[498/1000]	he was the new kid in her class and she was trying to follow through on her first orders to look after his first , first , and last question . there was no doubt in her mind that the
[499/1000]	the thought had popped into his mind for a second or two before it was discarded . he took a sip of his drink and glanced around . the pub was dark and nearly deserted . he could see no
[500/1000]	" yes , i 'm sure , " he said , pushing himself away from the counter . he turned toward me with a smirk . " so you wanted to drop dinner off for your parents ? "
[501/1000]	it did n't take long for them to reach the door , and he stopped to look back . glancing at her with an odd glint in his eye , he said , " tell you what : we 'll
[502/1000]	" and this is it ! " he pointed at a little square box . grace stepped closer , opened it , and said , " oh my god . " her father said nothing . "
[503/1000]	we both had a soft spot for the elderly lady in question . she is only about my size , but she never fails to make me laugh to her sheer beauty . when she arrived , i introduced her
[504/1000]	" i mean the nature of this land and the wealth we are all capable of . it has nothing to do with what your father gave me . " " enough ! " father yelled , springing up
[505/1000]	" hey , " she answered , smiling as she rubbed back at his hands . " you do n't need to hide from me , " he told her when they were finally alone in their room .
[506/1000]	the boy 's eyes were on the door , which closed with a sickening crack which i took to mean the door had just turned into a brick . a second later , the door was slammed as it
[507/1000]	though the small area had n't gotten bigger out of the park , it was still several miles away . the street was narrow and the street was paved with asphalt . he looked over the balcony at ava and
[508/1000]	i let my head fall back , closing my eyes to savor his sweetness . " i promise . " " we should make love . " his soft voice makes me stiffen up , but he does n't
[509/1000]	" i love you , too , " natalie replied , the words so strong and honest that the tears started rolling down her cheeks . she pulled out the baby monitor and pulled on the ear buds ,
[510/1000]	" we need to go and get a car to leave with the hotel , now . now . tonight . " " there 's nothing to pick up at the market . " " yes . the
[511/1000]	" i heard if i had to , all i 'd do was tell you that . " after i finished with the glass , i put the glass in a cabinet with the pictures of my dad under
[512/1000]	it 's a pretty good match , but i do n't care . a very short match . it 's on . i need a break . and a plan . i 'll pay whatever he
[513/1000]	she knew exactly where her husband had gone . he was hunting her down . she also knew that he would be waiting for her at her house . she took a deep breath and opened the door .
[514/1000]	" all right , " she said . " she 'll take care of it . " there was no answer , just the silence . then she was down the hill to the stables at least two dozen
[515/1000]	" what ? what 's wrong ? " " nothing . the car , " he said . she looked at it warily . " you drive this around , " she said . " no
[516/1000]	" i ca n't stay out here in the rain on top of <EOS> out <EOS> - the moon is getting ready to wear . it 's not the end of the world . " i thought about evan ,
[517/1000]	" have you . . . " she began , still looking for words . " no . " but he was laughing . " no , i have n't . " the statement came out more like a
[518/1000]	" the wolf ? what does that mean ? " his face softened . " i 'm sorry , jess . " " oh god . " her eyes burned with unshed tears . how many hours of arguing
[519/1000]	then i think of a simple thing : " how about i call in a favor of mrs. bethany ? " and she 's not sure what to say . the house is deserted , so i hurry upstairs
[520/1000]	the woman with thick , flowing hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail moved aside . ' yes ? ' ' i 'm from the cia , ' said bourne . ' i 'm going undercover . '
[521/1000]	" just give me five minutes . " he grabbed her <EOS> " this one is mine " folder and he held it out of her reach . " i 'm sorry , " he finally said to
[522/1000]	she 's wearing pretty purple flannel and has on her dark purple makeup . she carries a huge book that looks like a diary . it is light blue . i watch her reading . i am sure
[523/1000]	" we would n't say i wanted your father 's death to be easy , " said the doctor , continuing . " none of us would want the old man 's death the least bit easy . my work
[524/1000]	" what ? do n't ... what ? ... what ? " her mind was a blank as she tried to process what she was seeing . " it 's okay . i 'm here . " "
[525/1000]	he was right on the money . i did n't want to bring in the money and risk putting her in the middle of this . i did n't want to do the shitty thing she 's gotten herself into
[526/1000]	" we would better be off , " she muttered . she brushed him off and reached for her dress . " i love you . " " i ca n't wait to f * * k you ,
[527/1000]	" i know you did , and i 'm really glad you did . " she smiles and bites her lip , and my c * * k twitches just thinking about it . " i need to have
[528/1000]	" why do n't you talk to them , do you hear me ? " the old man sat quietly in the armchair and looked at tom and kaitlyn in silence . kaitlyn felt the pressure and tension and
[529/1000]	" let 's just say i have access to my collection , i 'm not a collector . well , that 's not what people here would call it , and there is n't much . they call it my
[530/1000]	1 dried 1 threw 1 half - formed 1 hit 1 tumbled 1 thick 1 sat 1 faded 1 shattered 1 split 1 lay - 1 fell 1
[531/1000]	" i ca n't get one . " " i know that . but you 'll keep trying anyway . do n't give up . " but the police told her to . and the judge was in
[532/1000]	" it does n't matter , " she said with a dismissive wave she used for her husband 's benefit . then she turned to her mother . " will they be all right ? " " i do
[533/1000]	my first instinct was to snap , to call the police , to try and put an end to this insanity before it could escalate out of control . i knew i could be reckless with my life , but
[534/1000]	my eyes met his - " i can have that car returned to you . if you take it anywhere , go to my dad 's house and have it towed from there to the garage ; you can get
[535/1000]	" where 's he ? " jim asked . " what ? " " where 's mike ? " " well , he was in portland over a couple of months ago ... but i saw him
[536/1000]	" i thought you were n't going to give it to me ? " she waved over one of the two guards . " go back into the ballroom . i 'm not coming with you . "
[537/1000]	" what 's happening ? " he did n't answer . he got in the car and pulled away . she sat staring after him , speechless . what she 'd seen was n't helping either . the strange
[538/1000]	and then he got lost in the images . and this was stupid because it was not going to work . with a bang , he pulled hard and hit a window . " no , let go
[539/1000]	" then did it ? ! " " no , honey ! " " yes , it did . " " you 're not a virgin , are you ? " " no , there was
[540/1000]	a few friends had dropped by . they had visited with olivia . she was a great friend to olivia - in fact , olivia 's friends were the reason they had all stopped by . " you still
[541/1000]	but that did n't make any sense . why would he decide to come back to new york , get married to another woman , come back to her in the middle of the night , with no answer from
[542/1000]	" do n't panic , " mrs. baxter said . " you need to eat something . " " the last time i tried to eat a pizza , it was this morning , " i said . "
[543/1000]	" yeah . i 'm just trying to help . could you at least not be angry that the woman you 're pretending to like is looking in the direction where you 're looking ? " " why would
[544/1000]	they both looked . an odd - looking brown - skinned woman was dancing in red , her hair tied in a high clip and a simple green dress tied modestly around her waist . " i should
[545/1000]	" it 's just that they ca n't give more money . they said we owe them fifty grand . " " what was that stupid - looking kid with the weird orange hair who was chasing us ?
[546/1000]	i turn in a slow circle , admiring my kitchen . " this should be great . " " so much better than the first time . " she walks slowly over to me , arms out as if
[547/1000]	" oh stop it , no . i just wanted to let everyone know that you 're alright . they were worried to death that they had n't heard about the party before monday . i told them i was
[548/1000]	" just like a man . " " not funny . " she did n't reply but did n't wait for him to respond . she moved to the kitchen and placed her purse on the counter .
[549/1000]	" i think being with you is the easy part . " she smiled . he lowered his lips to her right shoulder , but did not kiss her there . " you have n't asked anything of me
[550/1000]	" but it was n't . " " ah ... well , i could n't tell you . " " i could , though i do n't know if you could keep this a secret very long .
[551/1000]	there was no way he was going back to the cottage for the night , no way in hell he was going back to a deserted town just because a couple of other idiots had tried to scare him .
[552/1000]	" i need to sleep . " " you ca n't sleep . we need to find a way to get mom out of this . " a million thoughts raced through my head . it took a
[553/1000]	i smiled at him . " i know , i ca n't say the same for you though , that you are a mess inside . " he turned to me with his hand on the doorframe , watching me
[554/1000]	" i saw her this morning , but i was n't expecting to find her here . i did you a favor . " " great . " i watched as nick headed the other way , towards
[555/1000]	" i do n't suppose we could be more obvious ? " said mrs. slu ft . " we 're just looking through our copy of the book by john milton . there 's no actual reference here and no
[556/1000]	" the point is , i 'm happy , " she says with a huge smile , as if she 's just come up with it . " happy you are , with the man of your dreams ?
[557/1000]	" okay . " " good . here 's the list . " he pulled a piece of paper from his jacket pocket and gave it to her . " all you have to do is write down the
[558/1000]	i would n't hear from you ? " he lifted his hand and held it to her , his eyes holding her own . " there was a time when i would n't have believed it . you have
[559/1000]	i felt someone shaking me , so i glanced out the window . it was derek . i 'm afraid he was screaming my name . i wanted him to stop , to stop and to not even think
[560/1000]	" you never answered my question , " he answered . " you were n't telling me why you want me . " " you 'd be surprised . " she frowned . " when you say
[561/1000]	even as she waited for his response , every muscle in her body was tense , ready to defend herself . she had no idea why he 'd ask for her help . she had n't been able to
[562/1000]	there she went again , coming by this time with a cup of blood , and he knew that would be her next warning of the coming day . he knew that she was awake and conscious , and he
[563/1000]	" do you know anyone who is working on the site right now ? " " i sent a friend to know him when he was on vacation . " he pulled out his pda and pulled up
[564/1000]	" yeah , i 've never been outside your walls and never will , just like i would n't be allowed back here now , at any time you think you 're ready to go and find a life .
[565/1000]	" he 's a gentleman , " she teased . he laughed as he helped her out of her clothing , and she enjoyed the lingering strength he gave her as she ran her hands over the smooth skin
[566/1000]	maybe she was talking to herself . maybe her mental abilities were affected in the same way . maybe her brain was damaged somehow . maybe she was just losing it . maybe she 'd started thinking through
[567/1000]	he chuckled at me . " just a little . you can relax . it 'll settle down in no time . " " it feels so ... right , " i whispered . " there 's such
[568/1000]	" are there other people who have the same ? " i replied , my thoughts racing . he nodded . " yes . they always have . " " even the bad ? like , when you
[569/1000]	" i think you know them ? " " of course ! i was one of them for a while . some of them showed up and i could tell they were trying to set you up with some
[570/1000]	" and this would be ? " she wondered . she already knew the answer - it was a good question . he nodded . " i 'm making a decision , that 's all . i 'm not
[571/1000]	the lady with the purple hair was much older and not as pretty anymore either thanks to her heritage . " is this your best friend ? " she asked . " yeah , mom , this is my
[572/1000]	" that was the night we caught the thief , " he said . " how 'd you know he was the one ? " alex was uncomfortable with the subject change so he nodded . " he got
[573/1000]	' we 'll keep it simple . ' ' i guess that 's just how it is , ' the baron replied . ' i think a drink or two might be in order , father , '
[574/1000]	" do you think i can still see ? " she asked through clenched teeth . " you do n't have to see . of course you can . " " in case we do need to get
[575/1000]	her mouth fell open . she 'd probably read one of the books they had at her house because the pages were so wrinkled . of course the whole picture was one of the books they 'd kept in the
[576/1000]	" was it her ? " i asked , desperate to find out . " yeah . and she knows it . she told me to protect you . " " protect me from what ? what happens
[577/1000]	the nurse glanced up at him . " just for a second , mister . " he nodded and smiled . when they were both gone , he felt a wave of relief wash over him . a second
[578/1000]	" do n't pull that shit anymore , " i said . " i said it 's your funeral ! do n't you think i should be able to manage my own business ? " he demanded , his
[579/1000]	" <EOS> if she 'll give me the money , that was one hell of a ride , " kate said , " and she would have been . and i want your words of advice . " "
[580/1000]	" oh yes . it 's a good idea . " she grabbed the package from him and thrust it at him . " open it . " " i do n't know ... " " open it
[581/1000]	" oh , i thought we had a deal so do n't tell my mother ... " " whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... " i pulled her toward me . " fine . " she
[582/1000]	" are you that bad a liar ? " he challenged , his dark eyes narrowing slightly . " if there was a way , but i 'm pretty sure that i 'm just being honest with you .
[583/1000]	" me too . " i want to feel bad for him , but i know it 's for the best . the longer i hold out , the more likely it 'll be that i 'll give up
[584/1000]	" yes , i was . good night . " i replied , opening the door . " bye . " he said , holding out his hand . " goodbye , max . " i said ,
[585/1000]	this conversation could end here , here , wherever , whatever it may take us : no more of this conversation , no more of the drinking , no more , this does not matter , this simply could n't
[586/1000]	i would have been happy that he 'd come out at all , even if there were a number of un gracious guests . the idea of being alone in a room with mr. cataliades was appealing to me ,
[587/1000]	he shifted uncomfortably in the seat , and she did n't know how she knew that . but she did . he was n't going to tell her . there was no way she could understand . he 'd
[588/1000]	they are all afraid of the dark , and i am afraid of them . you are the light in my darkness , the way i am in your light . and we shall be alone forever ,
[589/1000]	" come on over , love . we have some hot chocolate to make and you have to get out of the freezing night air . " he looked away from the kitchen and reached for his suitcase .
[590/1000]	" yeah , " sam said . " you may think of that when you find out how much i spent . " " and i bet you 'll like it . i 'm hoping you 'll get the
[591/1000]	" i 'm good , " she said . " i 've already won this round . " " i think you 're a win the win type , " bob said , then turned to look at clay
[592/1000]	" yeah . i guess that 's true . " " so , there was no idea about them being a terrorist organization , right ? " " i do n't think so . i mean , it
[593/1000]	i kept hearing her scream ... the fire truck had hit the gas as the truck pulled away . i heard jason tell one of his men who was making the call to rush , and i started toward them
[594/1000]	" i 'm only going to say this once . all of it . let 's face it , you 're a bitch . you wanted a new life but you did n't have any parents or brothers and cousins
[595/1000]	" yes , " he said , glancing up to catch sam 's expression . " that 's what the other doctors say . " sam had to laugh and shake her head as she leaned back and finished
[596/1000]	" i do n't think of you as a sister , you 're so close - you 've seen my eyes and read my mind , and you 're always around to hold me when i got scared . you
[597/1000]	" it has happened , it has not , " said nachiketa . " i ca n't look at it without feeling better , or worse , or worse . no more visions or visits in my dreams . please
[598/1000]	" why are we even doing this ? " he asked . her eyebrows shot up . " why are we doing this ? " he opened his mouth , then closed it again . she watched him

[600/1000]	" we can hold it over your head , but you 've got to show me you 're a good judge of character . " " i 'm good at reading people . i 've been doing it since
[601/1000]	" ok , then let 's go for a ride , " said heather , excited . " okay . " " bye , my friend . take care . " she gave him a big hug .
[602/1000]	' is that what 's happening to you ? ' he could n't tell her the truth . he had n't told anyone , not even the sheriff in over twenty years . he had no way to defend
[603/1000]	" so , what now ? " asked the captain . " as soon as you see the map , we can decide on what to do with the rest of the crew . the captain thinks we should
[604/1000]	he raised his eyes to my face and smiled . it was a pleasant smile , but a sad one . " they do n't understand me . " i felt sad too . i 'd spent so many
[605/1000]	she had never been any use to a stranger the way this one was . " i do not like him . " " me neither . i will not stand for that sort of behavior . "
[606/1000]	" tell me where you think charles is , " i demanded . " he 's dead , " charles replied , lifting his head somewhat . " i am the enforcer of the local vampire council , and
[607/1000]	" what happened to you ? " " i was out somewhere , " said the vampire . " i returned late . " he seemed a little uncomfortable about their lack of address , like he knew they
[608/1000]	" he was too tired to take the plunge and take a shower , so i picked out a bunch of shoes and some pajamas . " she had picked out these dress slacks that got short . you
[609/1000]	i sigh , trying to ignore my hunger . " so who do you think it is and what did they want ? " " do you really care ? do you want to find out who it is
[610/1000]	" at any rate , my father is alive . " i tell him . " i would expect the three of you to rush over here , and help us subdue him . but that 's impossible . i
[611/1000]	" what can i do to help ? " asked the voice of her father . " nothing . just focus , " replied olivia , closing her eyes . as she closed her eyes again , the
[612/1000]	" i may not know everything about magic and magic myself , but i do know some spells against the shadow reaper , " lucinda said . " very good , lucinda . " " i know because
[613/1000]	" can i try something ? " she asked , stepping toward the closet . " oh yeah , sorry . i did n't get your name . " " it 's charlie . " his voice was very
[614/1000]	" what ? " " no . not me . " " why not ? i thought you wanted to be a vampire . " the green - gray color of his eyes deepened to a rich
[615/1000]	" i 'd take an arrow with one arm , but the arm might get torn off in the process . " " he got the money from the bank on the other end of the island ? "
[616/1000]	" no , " she said impatiently , and held her wrists up , her nails digging into his shoulders . he growled in frustration . the bed shifted , and she started to lift to her tiptoes ,
[617/1000]	he laughed when she poked him . " you 're not like that much of anything , " she taunted , tilting her head to one side and appraising him . he rolled his eyes and reached out ,
[618/1000]	she bit her lower lip , glancing at jared . " i want to go home . i do n't want to live in this place like the rest of you do . " at my look , a
[619/1000]	" it 's a risk we must take , " said the captain . " you ca n't take the risk , " said the captain . " you and your officers are a step or two behind us
[620/1000]	" we shall not eat until he has changed the subject . the way of the empire . " " oh , well i ... " the guards spoke quietly , as if hearing what they wanted to
[621/1000]	" we will have a meeting when next you join us , " robert replied . that evening robert and his wife , laura , headed for the river . alice tried her best to be civil , trying
[622/1000]	" no , do n't worry , " i assure him , just then realizing i 've been crying . we 've just stopped and he has not . when i get back to the front door , i notice
[623/1000]	" what was your dream about ? " he asked . she lifted her hand in his , then pulled away to look at him . " the baby ? it 's my favorite . how about that ?
[624/1000]	" i did . " i looked up from the documents i was studying for the fifteenth time . " but i 'm pretty sure . i came on her job and worked after school and everything . i did
[625/1000]	i knew then and there that there was no way into the sanctuary . the worst question i 'd asked jesse was what would happen if me sleeping here was more than just a cheap motel room . in the
[626/1000]	" he 'll get out , " i offer with a sigh as her face brightens when she spots me . " maybe . we wo n't be able to kill him , though . " she shakes her
[627/1000]	" you can say that again ! you can say that again ! " " i 'm a healer , girl , " responded her mother without looking up , as her hair fell onto her lap . "
[628/1000]	" no , not really . i 've been hoping ... " " so did i. " " look , you 're trying to sell something , " he whispered into her hair . she pulled back
[629/1000]	no ! it could n't be happening . he was too far gone to think clearly when something like this had almost happened . after all , all he needed was a doctor . maybe then he 'd be better
[630/1000]	i knew she had had plenty of practice , but this was n't just any old beat up old track coach , this was an old veteran who had had his fill of our little party . " you
[631/1000]	the big blue neon sign reading go buy yourself some real underwear said i 'm <EOS> in a mood . i looked at my wristwatch . this is n't getting me anywhere . i spent a long time pacing the

[633/1000]	" she 'd probably come in <EOS> 'd notice that he used to keep her car would n't let her drive it . " i could n't do that because she 's an extremely capable human being she 's
[634/1000]	a large group of soldiers were waiting at the beach there waiting to lead them around the compound . " where are we going ? " asked candi . " to get the hell out of here ,
[635/1000]	" i 'll be around tomorrow , " he said . " would you like me to stay the night ? i 'll be out later tonight . i 'll call you in the morning and we 'll sneak something
[636/1000]	her voice held a mixture of surprise and hope . " how 'd you know how to get my number ? i only have a few friends ... " " i know exactly how you got it . "
[637/1000]	" i was in a coma for a long time . i had been sleeping for nearly ten years . for a while it went on like that , but then i woke up . it had all come to
[638/1000]	and for as long as it took after he was done with me , i would n't need to listen to excuses from his parents . chapter two " <EOS> pretty - is the water in the water
[639/1000]	but then she came up with an idea . " what about - " before either one of us could move , nadia and verlaine walked in their bedroom door and joined us on the floor . when she
[640/1000]	" no , " she said shaking her head . i sighed . she had been so happy , i had not felt like holding it all back for long . when she had come back a couple
[641/1000]	but the next day , there was a big " a * * hole . " as soon as i got to school , i rushed into the classroom to find liz in front of her desk , typing
[642/1000]	" i do n't know ... " " i 'll pick you up at seven . " " i - i 'm not sure if i 'll want to . " " please . i just need
[643/1000]	" i 'll give them to you . " she handed the bundle to her own attendant , and went with them to the edge , where they bowed as he entered the great hall . the first thing
[644/1000]	" you have , but that was , until a couple of days ago . he said he did n't really care , but then he never did . so when i was drunk and i 'd been in a
[645/1000]	he smiled . " your reaction will be unexpected . " he took a few steps toward me , and my eyes followed him . he crouched in front of me , and put his hand under my chin and
[646/1000]	but do i really want to know the answer ? once the idea formed , i swallowed in a tight - lipped movement , refusing to let the tears i knew were coming attack my hands . i tried
[647/1000]	i moved my torso and legs , rolling off the bed trying to keep my belly flat and not flip him over to make him roll me on top of him . i saw his feet , a little bent
[648/1000]	' it 's a sign , an all - knowing sign , the sign that god 's plan is to tell us we 're all of a kind . but he does n't tell us that . ' she turned
[649/1000]	" it is n't like that , " he reiterated . " i just want to get to know her the way you 've grown to love her . you know i 'm a damn good judge of character .
[650/1000]	there 's a few seconds of silence that becomes awkward . i stare at the black metal door for a minute before i realize that ryan 's not in there . i glance at the door and just stand there
[651/1000]	" no . " david frowned . " after i cut off a hand and used it to do the dirty work , i decided i did n't fit in anymore . i thought if i added a little blood
[652/1000]	his father turned to look at him . " why are you still here ? why did n't you just go ? " " i could n't leave . how did that happen ? " " you met
[653/1000]	" i could tell you all about how you killed that man and he would have never been able to do it , though i could not speak for you . the difference might be that i have proven myself
[654/1000]	" i really saw enough of my parents ' deaths . " he nodded absently , suddenly aware that he only had eyes for her the rest of the time , and that he might as well get straight
[655/1000]	he frowned at me . " he 's a vampire , " i said emphatically . i looked up at him questioningly , " you said you could control them . " " i can , but there
[656/1000]	" and those boys ... were they dangerous ? " she stared at the floor in front of her so long i felt like i could n't look at her and waited for her answer . " they
[657/1000]	" what ? i do n't like you being out here . " " you 're right . i 'm sorry . " she nods and then looks at me . " ready ? " i open
[658/1000]	" it 's a pretty amazing city . " i shrugged , confused . " it does n't have many people ? " " no . but it 's pretty good . the buildings go up and down
[659/1000]	i could feel the adrenaline rushing to my veins , and there was no hiding the surprise in my eyes . apparently , the world saw things differently than anyone else wanted to believe . and just like that ,
[660/1000]	" no , you do n't , " he says , as if i should know better . " but i do know what happened to her . i know that no matter how hard you try to act like
[661/1000]	" when will the house be ready ? " she asked . " tomorrow , since i 'm having meetings every day . " i wanted to ask if he had a lunch date for the next day
[662/1000]	and then it 's done , and that 's what i wanted . " and we 'll all be there for you . " of course , the wedding is next saturday because i have plenty of time
[663/1000]	he lifted his head . " i do n't know . " my lips pressed together to stop my sobs . i threw my backpack in my car , got in , took off , and then stopped short
[664/1000]	" you should understand . it 's his way of life . he 's going to run from someone like you . " the thought of losing any child of his made her ache inside . running from someone
[665/1000]	chapter three " what about tomorrow ? does the moon and the forest around it need tending ? " the voice of thomas greeted him from the other side of the glass of the office door . " you
[666/1000]	he stared at mr. kennedy , who blinked to ask why she was even entertaining such a notion . " we do for everyone , " she said and walked away . the smell of fresh baked bread came
[667/1000]	there is nothing i can do . without it , my life is over . i do n't want to die ; i do n't know what i 'll do if not being here makes me sick in the
[668/1000]	" it 's the best . i 'm on a call . " i did n't move . " maybe she was attacked by wolves , " i said . " wolves ? " " i
[669/1000]	" like you could have ! for god 's sake ! you were his best friend , for god 's sake ! " " but for what ? " i said , startled . that 's when the
[670/1000]	" is this your idea , son ? " " you ca n't refuse to take what i do have ? " i asked . she nodded . " it 's my call , " i said
[671/1000]	" no . " i shook my head , and he took my hand from his chest to rest it on my lap . " you know , that could be true . " he was smiling again ,
[672/1000]	" just to be on the safe side , " he finished . he still looked over at us . " i appreciate that you were able to watch . i appreciate you knowing my wife 's schedule . "
[673/1000]	" i ... " he stopped and cleared his throat . " i do n't like it . i do n't like why there 's a blood bank on your lawn like something out of the 19 4 0s .
[674/1000]	" well , yeah . " she closed her eyes , as if she 'd been looking out the window at her life instead of at him . " it 's not pretty all the time , getting caught in
[675/1000]	" are they my parents ? " " of course . " " and the others ? " " they 're here . " she looked around when she walked in , her eyes finding the
[676/1000]	" what ? " she asked . " your place , " he responded . " i 'm inviting you on a date . i hope you change your mind . " the look on her face was
[677/1000]	then she shrugged her shoulders . " it 's not really <EOS> ... a secret , like you said . i think i 'm going to have to ask my boss . " she walked toward me and hugged
[678/1000]	she glanced up in time to see his expression turn serious . " when the time comes to come at another time , we 'll have to make it a quick one . you do n't even know that he
[679/1000]	" very good , " he said , eyes still fixated on me , and then nodded toward an arched doorway behind me . " there 's a bathroom in there . make yourself at home . i 'm headed
[680/1000]	" no , " he said , giving her shoulder a gentle shake . though she wore a tight pair of gray trousers and a pink button - down shirt this spring , the neckline was open and showing her
[681/1000]	without a word , hunter started for the main road , the one he picked in the middle of nowhere . he was on the hunt for the trail , but he was so exhausted he could easily have fell
[682/1000]	" only if i have to , " he said , still feeling the effects of the liquor , and it was not <EOS> like hot chili . taking what he could get , he took some painkillers and got
[683/1000]	it took another eight minutes to reach st. michael 's hospital , which also served as the hospital 's central emergency room . mary had checked her out . she was in good hands except for getting shot , the
[684/1000]	the guy nodded grimly . " i was there , when the police got there on a stretcher and they came for him . you know we 're as good as dead but we get paid extra to go back
[685/1000]	" the other women here , the ones who stay out here because of their youth and work , they thought it was beautiful when they walked up . only three times had any of us ever seen anyone else
[686/1000]	" who said he was a prisoner ? all he 'll admit will be that he 's a bloody lunatic . " " i 've already tried , " said the captain . " and i suspect he is
[687/1000]	i shook my head and grabbed his hand . " no , that 's going to be the last time . " after a few minutes of silence , scott said , " so ... he 's dead ?
[688/1000]	" but it will be better to return now . " he bowed , " your highness . " " are you leaving , captain ? " she asked . he bowed again . " yes ,
[689/1000]	chapter 31 : a long , long , long , long honeymoon " i 'm taking a nap , " i mutter . my phone buzzes , but i ignore it . yeah , i know it 's
[690/1000]	' why should you care if he 's a virgin ? is it so wrong that i want to know all about him ? ' ' oh , that 's quite what i 'm working on . '
[691/1000]	he shook his head and grinned . " that 's a good one . i love your mouth . " " the way you talk about my mouth is seriously f * * king me up . "
[692/1000]	he started off into the dark while waiting for the others , almost running into people and knocking over people . he could see the white floor and floor and floor colors flashing behind the translucent walls . "
[693/1000]	she did n't believe him . her gaze drifted over the woman 's body . the wound was deep and red . a deep wound . her heart beat too damn quickly . but the woman was
[694/1000]	i ran over to the door . " please do n't tell me it is the same one . " his face grew hard and stormy . " no , but - " " you do n't have
[695/1000]	" this is n't part of the plan , " he said firmly . her expression soured . " of course not . but i do n't want to take a chance on you being harmed because of me
[696/1000]	" yes , " agreed the ambassador . " i know . but at least we could live in peace , and see our children on the other side . and the empire ... we have to admit , there
[697/1000]	her heart pounding in her ears , violet ran into the kitchen to escape the man staring at her with blank indifference . she searched for a napkin to wipe some of the sweat from her face . "
[698/1000]	" oh ! " rachel says , her eyes brimming from the tears that are filling them , " i 'm sorry . " her face is hot with embarrassment as she puts on her seatbelt and pulls out of
[699/1000]	" well , i want to go out now . " i pull the door open and grab her by the hand . " where are you taking such a long time ? " she slides out of
[700/1000]	she grinned . " i 'm not sure . i 'd be nice to go home sometime soon . " " my , my , what a pleasant thought . " " a nice idea , my lady
[701/1000]	" i told you , " holden replied . " just get right on it . " holden worked the maneuvering thrusters and started maneuvering them , and at first it did n't respond at all , but after
[702/1000]	" no . " he looked up at her , a quizzical expression on his face . " right . you 'd never make the same mistake . " chapter fifteen the only sound on the street
[703/1000]	it had been a pretty cool morning . the first time i went to the studio after going to work , i was pretty sure i was on the last one of the tour . the guys were all in
[704/1000]	' i 'm staying in his bedroom , ' i declare , picking my way across the rough wood floor to the bed . ' be nice . get in the bath first , we 'll get started at
[705/1000]	" just how ? " he winked . " i told you . i 'll give him ten thousand to give you . he 's one of those guys who is a fan of ' rock ' and he
[706/1000]	" it was wonderful , and i missed the smell of this farm . you ca n't believe how many farms , even those , are in poor repair and could use the real estate sales services . " he
[707/1000]	one of the members says ' why us ? ' i shrug , shaking my head . ' i think i need to sit down . ' my dad says to the soldiers , ' please escort
[708/1000]	" she was one of us . " and you , " she added , knowing how important he must have been to her to be able to tell what he knew , even if he could n't imagine it
[709/1000]	he stepped back and his face grew paler . " i do n't know . i 'm not sure i want to know . but i do know that you 're a man of your word and i care what
[710/1000]	he was good . he 'd probably take the news the wrong way . " and the bastard killed my baby daughter too , just like the guy killed <EOS> friggin ' thing . and if he was afraid
[711/1000]	" not if you have to start all over . if you want to prove how you can talk your heart out about letting us work together . " " you 're just like your uncle , trying to
[712/1000]	" if it 's that easy to get what you need , maybe you should start looking at things differently . " that gave him pause , as though he thought he knew her better than she thought she
[713/1000]	i feel like an ass , seeing her so distraught and so hurt . if i could go back - if i could ask blake - i know he would give me the reassurance and a reason to forgive him
[714/1000]	" i think that 's the perfect thing , do n't you ? " the president said suddenly , looking as if something had happened . " thank you for taking such good care of her , mr. president
[715/1000]	" why did n't she get married ? " her voice is high and shrill , but i do n't hesitate . " she 's - she left me . " i do n't know what i 'm saying
[716/1000]	" you 're not going to believe the information i got up to in that hotel ... " and then the guy walked away . " hey ! " qhuinn took on a protective stance , and
[717/1000]	before i could object , a small voice spoke . " i think it 's time you had a family . " chapter 5 i sat in the kitchen while my sister sara and her husband jim
[718/1000]	" good . as i understand , a couple of the guards are engaged in conversation with the guard outside your door , who , as i understand it , is called ca stile . has he arrived ? "
[719/1000]	" ah , yes , the real question is what do i do with you ? " he asked with a lopsided grin . " go away . " " sounds good to me . " he
[720/1000]	" i do , " i said . my voice was hoarse . he was still staring at me . " what ? " i asked , needing to know . i looked down at his clothes .
[721/1000]	" i do n't like that he asked me what kind of water you drank . if you do , you should tell him you 're pregnant . you heard him just fine in - " " no ,
[722/1000]	" oh ! " the woman turned to the small children but they were all watching and she looked directly at me . " you must have me confused with someone else . " i said . she went
[723/1000]	" i knew it ! " i shout , swinging the hammer back and forth ; cutting a furrow in the thick glass at both ends of the bar as it comes down . we both hear it splinter into
[724/1000]	as they boarded a red tur nip in the harbour below the island a young jamaican sat at a small table to the right nearest the galley and looking out at the gulf waters below . the atmosphere there gave
[725/1000]	" wait , not to be rude but - " i did n't hear it , i already noticed . it broke my heart that i could somehow be so oblivious , so blind to some things ,
[726/1000]	they were all sitting there , including mr. mul queen , at the table to which the king 's servants had rushed the king . some of their own , he saw , were also sitting , but all the
[727/1000]	i did n't know if i could trust him . why was he so hard on me ? he was a cop and a friend , and i was n't supposed to be so attracted to him . i had
[728/1000]	' we 're almost done here , ' the young man who was in charge offered . after they had finished the work the men loaded their horses and led them away from the house . ' so
[729/1000]	she smiled and stood for a moment in the doorway to watch him , wondering where this man who spoke to a thousand people had come from the desert . she shivered when he smiled at the women and children
[730/1000]	i nod . " she 'll come . " he nods back , firmly . then his lips are on mine again . as if he can not believe what just happened . he 's hard as flint and
[731/1000]	chapter 42 the next day , i stopped to write my best idea for the summer and hit the road . the new town did n't have many tourists , the place was big , you could barely
[732/1000]	" okay , that 's it ! that 's it ! you 're outta here ! " with that i was pulled backwards over the edge of the building , my feet only half touching the ground . the last
[733/1000]	" i got a friend who 's really into being a cop . " " you 're going to be stuck with him until you figure a way to leave him and get back to him . i can
[734/1000]	she was going to leave . she 'd leave him behind . he closed his eyes . it would be easier if she did . leave . she deserved better . he was her whole life . why should he
[735/1000]	" why ? " he called out to ben . when the little boy responded he could be heard laughing , " because it 's a stupid name , i guess . " " oh it 's not
[736/1000]	she opened the doors to the tunnel to find a huge hangar with about a hundred spaceships inside . small lights lit the entire area . her nose sniffed the air . she walked inside of the hangar .
[737/1000]	' yeah , ' he answered , nodding , though his eyes were also as curious as a cat 's . ' yeah , i knew that . and besides , this is a new business . new people .
[738/1000]	once we had a bed again , he took out the spare key for the house . once we were comfortable , he was off to work until midnight . i had gone with him to visit his brother about
[739/1000]	" wait . " he grabbed her face , forcing her to look at him . " i 'm not letting you go just yet , not now . " " i know , i know . why am
[740/1000]	but in a peculiar way , it did . the difference was that he knew . a part of him ached at the thought of walking away . that part of him longed for the unknown . not
[741/1000]	the kid must have seen their indecision because he said , " there 's some stuff we do n't need to worry about . i 'll take care of it . my aunt meredith 's worried we 're screwing up
[742/1000]	" yes , i do . i mean , no , no , i do n't know . i do n't remember much outside my dreams . but now , i am so confused . what happened last night in
[743/1000]	' it 's a little worse , ' said the doctor , in his high german accent . ' how , then ? ' asked payton . ' they 're called the black unit - the ones that
[744/1000]	three hundred dollars for one meal . hell , two hundred dollars for the bathroom , for a horse . " that explains why they 've made certain promises to get the stallion over next winter . not because
[745/1000]	" thank you for answering the phone , darling . i told you i was getting fired ... " his voice trailed off . she put a hand in the crook of both his elbow and led him out
[746/1000]	he rolled his neck . " give it back in a minute and stop being stubborn , " he bit out , still not looking at me . i leaned into him and snapped , " i ca
[747/1000]	" i have a right to know . hell , " he said , staring down at her , " i want to know who i 'm stuck with . i 'm more sure of myself now than i was

[752/1000]	" do n't come near us ! " adam 's voice echoed in the room , but no one paid it much heed . the other guardians appeared unsure of what to do to adam 's threat . the
[753/1000]	something had triggered her memory . not as bad this time as the first attack from the horde , but no longer for the reasons she 'd thought . her survival instincts had kicked into high gear , and the
[754/1000]	they waited about half an hour to be sure that there was no one left , before nick and his foster sister moved forward and joined the others . " hey , nick ! " he greeted .
[755/1000]	" so , that 's it ? " " yes , that 's it . " " but when <EOS> you ca n't find the dead priest , does he have money to pay you back for all
[756/1000]	i was going to tell him we were n't going to get married until the end of the year ; but instead , i began throwing stuff away which led to a messy , uncomfortable morning . i had

[759/1000]	he picked them up again , shaking his head . " these are amazing . they resemble what we saw in the vault . " " you think maybe they were made at a laboratory ? " i asked
[760/1000]	" you 've been down here for weeks now . i 've been talking to the doctor about what 's going on , so i know the procedure by heart . " he leaned over and kissed the top
[761/1000]	" you 'd get a better offer . that 's a sure thing . " " if the weather 's good . if they give you a week to land this trip . " " i bet that
[762/1000]	" oh , " replied henry again . " then do n't worry , " he said , reassuringly . " i 'll treat this like a business trip , i promise . " henry looked into the eyes
[763/1000]	" i had quite an eventful evening , " she said , hoping she was sounding confident . if the dowager had n't noticed her flushed face and hollow eyes , she was neither listening nor listening to her
[764/1000]	and how many of her family are back home with their family ? how many of them are dead ? " he swallowed back the lump of emotion lodged in his throat . " ten . " she
[765/1000]	" i know in my heart you 're more than a friend with benefits , and i know that in a couple of days you 'll want in on all of his shit . " once again there was
[766/1000]	" it is , but what could you possibly know about it ? " asked clarence . " it has been said by many men that it is the greatest treasure of all time . the legend of the
[767/1000]	" yeah , they 're together . " " what 's the story with the women ? " " they 're like ... like a family , right ? " " yeah , sometimes we meet people
[768/1000]	" <EOS> " " " one moment . " they both started with the last line . " i can tell you what to expect , " said bourne . " i 'll take care of that
[769/1000]	" and the way you have - " i shook my head . " you said there were other things i would like in your apartment . " " yeah , but that was before ; i said
[770/1000]	" yeah , yeah , " he said , pushing himself off the wall . " i ca n't stop thinking about you . " her thoughts trailed away to caleb , the loss of him so profound ,
[771/1000]	" what about your boyfriend before you met him ? he seemed nice . " i laughed softly . " we work together . " " is that all ? " " that 's all . "
[772/1000]	" you ca n't run out on me , " she tried to snap . " i love you , too . " he pushed out of her grip and she stepped back . he met the back of the
[773/1000]	" i need to get going , " he said , still not letting go of me . he sat himself down in the seat next to me before pulling me down beside him with his arm draped across my
[774/1000]	" with one arm , " he said , " and one arm , he can not help himself . " " have you seen me , " i said , " since last night ? " "
[775/1000]	they reached the stables , and basha stopped as soon as they saw the group of horse - dealers coming out of the barn to talk to him . he hesitated , wondering if he should let these people lead
[776/1000]	" see , i know what you get , " he whispered into her ear . " that 's the kind of job you get . the job you do n't have to do . you do n't have to
[777/1000]	chapter 3 : running away the heat of the day was stifling in the building on the other side of the courtyard . one of the workers pushed the gates open for me , and in two steps i
[778/1000]	" i have a friend who knows a guy . you would think a man like that would have a chance to get to know about a real wife . " " no shit . where 'd you get
[779/1000]	" yes , yes . i want you ; love you . " chase 's eyes burned into hers until she felt herself begin to tremble . god help her , she did . " yes , love you
[780/1000]	" not even a little bit , " i joked , " right ? " her eyes narrowed on me , " what does that mean ? " " i think your lack of commitment bothers me .
[781/1000]	" now there 's something i ai n't never heard . you 're a fine looking kid . i think you could be the one . " " then why are you smiling ? " " because you
[782/1000]	" then how about i turn off my phone and we have a beer and a beer ? what do you say ? " he thought about it . if they were casual , they were comfortable . "
[783/1000]	" the rules do n't apply to a vampire , " max murmured in her ear , a slow , seductive swipe of his hand against her upper back . " you need to become accustomed to me . "
[784/1000]	" if you 're ready to go , i will , " i answered , not liking that it was clear . he grinned . " then let 's do it . " " there 's another part
[785/1000]	" the last thing i want is to complicate this . " " complicate what ? " " bring me death . " " ah . " i lowered his hand and looked into his dark eyes
[786/1000]	the door to the restaurant swung open and the owner stepped inside without waiting for an invitation . without waiting for a nod , he stepped aside into the small restaurant . " gentlemen , lovely evening . "
[787/1000]	" what 's that in your hand ? " she asked , peering over his shoulder . she could tell he was using one hand to try to scan the room . he shrugged and threw aside the book
[788/1000]	" i have always been a good worker , but we just really do n't have time for this ; i wish you could just send someone to give me a report <EOS> when i need something , " i
[789/1000]	" but ... why only with me ? " " because i 'm smart . " this made sense to me . just on principle . we sat on the grass and stared at each other and
[790/1000]	she said , ' the children are making their escape . ' ' and they know this ? ' ' yes . i told them . ' i stopped at the bridge , a distance between us
[791/1000]	" how long has it been since this happened ? " she asked her parents . the question came out more with genuine alarm than she intended . " i know this is probably a bad time to start
[792/1000]	" what the hell do you propose i do ? " i snapped . " well , just let me say sorry about getting you that kicked . " he was smiling now . " oh god .
[793/1000]	chapter 14 the first thing i notice when i walk into my apartment is someone 's face leaning over a mirror that 's hanging on the wall . it 's close by , but i ca n't see behind
[794/1000]	when he felt the first tremor begin , he braced himself with one hand on the van - side bumper and lifted his other hand to help her up the rest of the way . " thank god
[795/1000]	his eyes were on me , and i felt them studying me . " sorry , " i mumbled as i went to the couch and sat when denny took his seat . " why are you calling ? "
[796/1000]	" it 'd be the best way to cover my tracks and escape the investigation . i 'll have the number of your agent working a little overtime in here . " " good . i was afraid that
[797/1000]	" i do n't think that 's possible . we 've only known each other two days . " still she insisted on saying , " he 's a grown man . " " i know that ,
[798/1000]	" this woman is a menace , " he snarled . " they think she 's in league with the elves , the black thumbs . " " i do n't believe any of those things , " i
[799/1000]	he left me standing there and started heading to the bathroom . i was so tempted to call him back and fight him for putting me in a bubble , but before i could , he was gone .
[800/1000]	with the exception of the small fact that all of us hated him , i was the only one who had a problem when a zombie fell on me when i was sitting on the recliner . i would end
[801/1000]	" that a fire ? " chris asked , looking at seth . " not the least bit hot , " seth replied . " it 's just a matter of time before it 's burned out . and
[802/1000]	my hand tightened around his and i pulled him away again , taking on a fierce scowl . " you did what ? " he straightened . " i did n't mean to upset you . just thought i
[803/1000]	" that 's two to one . " " how big are you , huh ? " " about six - four . how big are you , mister ? " " why does asking you that
[804/1000]	" i thought you were one of them ? " she asked , concerned . he looked away from her hand and gave a half - smile . " they were my grandparents for a while . " he
[805/1000]	her fingers clenched into tight fists . he had her so close , just a whisper from his lips ... only let her forget the past . ca n't give in . ca n't - his mouth dropped
[806/1000]	the next morning , jason and his parents both looked at cory and said in unison , " yep . this was the beginning of the end . " then they retired for the day and returned to the
[807/1000]	" so it is ! " rachel said . " so it does indeed . " benji ran out into the yard . rachel was disappointed that she did n't get to stay at school to watch sarah
[808/1000]	" i 'm ready , " said the teenager . mrs. ha gue , who had arrived within minutes behind the police car , held her hands down by her sides and smiled broadly , her eyes wide ,
[809/1000]	" the end of the life 's short one ? " i stopped - the memories of a memory too painful to keep - and was suddenly on my feet before i could stop myself . but even as
[810/1000]	" where to ? " " what do you think ? " i leaned forwards and my lips grazed the side of his throat . after just one kiss he tasted different , almost metallic . " i
[811/1000]	before they could stop me i 'd taken the sword , and i held it out to my person . the two men froze , staring at their blade . " what have you done ? " my
[812/1000]	" yes . " it 's not like we do . we do n't hide behind a rock , we do n't live in a church or a mall or a shopping center . and even if we did ,
[813/1000]	i smile that i see it for the first time . she 's so open to me . " so i tried to scare you . " i shrug . " i figured if i scared you , then you
[814/1000]	the sound of a vehicle door closing echoed through the stillness of this isolated room . she had n't been inside , but she knew exactly where this had been going . sam had left her place a half
[815/1000]	just then , we were jostled by another wave of attackers . this time the man who was moving was n't lucky . two of his attackers tried to land a punch on him , and another grabbed him by
[816/1000]	i was looking at him . maybe i had n't heard him right . " your ... your son ? he 's pregnant ? " my whole body began shaking . " no ! he 's not my son
[817/1000]	" you do n't know how beautiful you are , " i whispered into his hair . " i hope not , " he mumbled against my skin , and i smiled . after we got ready ,
[818/1000]	my body felt heavy as i was forced to sit up . i found it difficult to catch my breath ; i felt dizzy with the effort . i looked around for something to hold onto . " wait
[819/1000]	he grabbed onto the railing , his legs buckling under him . there was a knock at the back of the room . he turned . captain high field stood in the doorway . ' well ,
[820/1000]	" how does he look and smell ? " her mom asked . " he 's fine . he wo n't fight me for you , mom . " " that 's good good . " her
[821/1000]	" i just called to tell you that i have met someone to talk to for a while . " and what ? when would she let the subject of him go ? " hi ! nice to hear
[822/1000]	" not a one . only ... i did find out that he had gotten drunk one night and he was talking about how he was going to make a move on the girl , and ... " she waved
[823/1000]	" come in , come in ! " the man outside said with a smile . it was a very small man , he was not six feet tall and muscular . his skin was the sandy colour of bleached
[824/1000]	" get a load of the blood . " " what 's going on ? is it some kind of death ? " " no , " ashe muttered . " what were the deaths ? "
[825/1000]	" it 's my baby sister , " she said . " i 'll be fine with the car . " " fine with me , too , " he agreed . alex wondered if she 'd be
[826/1000]	" i miss that girl so much , " said charlie . " i thought she was going to die . i thought we were all going to get married ! " " i hope nothing else happened ,
[827/1000]	he nodded , " i understand . no need to hurry this up . " he was not enjoying himself , remembering the terror the boy had felt , but the boy had done his duty and he must keep
[828/1000]	" oh . but for some reason i 've been told you will be needed at some point on your journey . i 'm not , unfortunately , informed of such an eventu ality . i will be contacted for
[829/1000]	she nodded and stepped back from him . " i 'll be in my office if you need me . " she started to close the door and then paused . " i do n't know how to contact you
[830/1000]	a short time later when they reached the truck , there was a short delay when they started searching the immediate area . ' are we going to that park ? ' liz asked . they were so close
[831/1000]	" no , " i said , " they took me to the hospital , and did n't let me in . they were gone until the next morning . they had to make sure i was n't drunk or
[832/1000]	as if it were your fault your father 's been fired . i ca n't tell you what to do over there . and i do n't hear nothing through the room that you hear . " i raised
[833/1000]	" i feel my phone vibrate at your elbow almost as if it had turned on , " he said . he glanced down at it , frowning . " you 've got a text . " i nodded
[834/1000]	" yes . " " then tell me how , " he suggested darkly . my eyes widened , then narrowed . i pushed , but he would n't budge . i was going to have to deal
[835/1000]	" you 're still on that , right ? " he says , turning the cart back to the other end of the aisle . " right . " he takes my elbow and i lift my leg over
[836/1000]	i could feel those eyes scanning me then the house and i looked up to see sam sitting on the front step watching me and the door to the study flew open . he was dressed in his study
[837/1000]	" wow , this thing is big . " he nodded . " there 's six people in my family . " " i was telling you about a girl before you even got there . i bet
[838/1000]	" that is a real kick , you good for him . " i sighed . " he 's not my boyfriend , " i said . " if you 're not with him , who are you
[839/1000]	" so you 're telling me ? " " it was a business plan . " he shook his head . " i never dreamed it would work out this way . " " it was easy
[840/1000]	" it 's obvious , " john said , standing up . " the first one was going through a divorce . the second one was the first one . " " they 're not dating , are they
[841/1000]	" if you are concerned for my well being , i could explain . you should know who i am . " " i know who you are . " he turned and walked into the main house .
[842/1000]	" please do not misunderstand me because i have never known anyone like him , " she whispered . his eyes flickered down to her hands . " the other night i could feel yours , a touch as tangible
[843/1000]	" do n't be too hard on him , " the man urged gently . " he 's not your boss . " she let out a bitter laugh . " i guess that 's the thing . he
[844/1000]	she saw him looking at her dress again and he smiled . she wished he would n't because she did n't like the way she was looking at the dress because it made her feel exposed and she did
[845/1000]	" let 's go ! " i nodded at the line of cars . dean grabbed his arm , and i spun to find him there , standing there with a huge grin on his face . " this
[846/1000]	a few more moments of silence passed and he continued . at the breaking of the fast the men began eating a few more pieces of meat . mike knew there was no telling who was going to wake up
[847/1000]	" no not as she should have . " " how long have you been working for her ? " " only two years . " " i still remember that night . " when i 'd
[848/1000]	he was suddenly gone . i turned to the left , running through the hall that held his rooms . his door was closed , but he was sitting on his bed , his head thrown back , his
[849/1000]	there was a sharp knock on the door and then the sound of some fumbling , as well as a few quick knocks . she heard their footsteps as they moved across the wood , and then the door was
[850/1000]	" what is this ? " he asked , sounding bewildered . " it 's not mine . who is it ? what - " " it found a way to cross the moat into your keep after all
[851/1000]	" yeah , it is , " matt said , laughing again . " well , he 's the strongest werewolf i know , so he 's going to turn her . " matt tried to think about
[852/1000]	* * * " did you find the scroll ? " " what scroll ? " " the scroll that had n't been burned to ashes . " well , i do n't know exactly where
[853/1000]	" uh ... i'm off to bed . " he was ready to fight . " now ! " with a slow sigh , he gathered her in his arms and took off down the hall . as
[854/1000]	" where are they ? " the voice said . " still out there , i guess . " " where where ? " " in the sky , " reacher said . " about five hundred
[855/1000]	" and just who is your son ? " " his name is jack leeds , miss morrison . " " that 's weird , jack leeds . " " i know , i 've never met
[856/1000]	the words played through her mind ... like a piano , singing his praises . she opened her mouth but no sound came out . " i ... have a better guess than that . i 'd say i
[857/1000]	he nodded , his eyes never looking away from me , smiling almost . " a week . " i swallowed and bit my lip , eyes filled with emotions i barely wanted to see there . trying to push
[858/1000]	" thank you for your time , mr. grey . you have been the best patient of all . " she puts her hand on his on her back , but then closes her eyes , eyes of longing for

[860/1000]	" the first time you want to act ? " " when was the last time ? my life feels like it 's been suspended . i ca n't sit around waiting for a moment that i 'll miss
[861/1000]	" not right now . my schedule is more important . and you 're here early . when will you be back ? " she looked up then , seeming surprised that someone had called ahead to see her
[862/1000]	" your hair looks fine , " he said , " and your eyes are lit up like a peacock . " " thank you ! " i squealed . " let me show them to you . "
[863/1000]	" do n't listen to the stupid shit you say , " he said . " you 're not going to die . they have no reason to kill you . " he did n't know what to say ,
[864/1000]	when she looked up she saw him and it was all she could do not to smile . she was stunned at how easily he 'd taken over that role . she watched as seth stepped forward to kiss her
[865/1000]	" who 's your boyfriend , big guy ? " his eyes hardened . " my ex - girlfriend . " " how did you get into the navy ? " " you 're gon na like
[866/1000]	" did you send him the file ? " " i might 've . " this was n't something she expected . she was going to have to try harder to do that . the elevator dinged
[867/1000]	" but it is so old , " i say . " it has been longer than the original , " he tells me , staring hard at the carved carving . it must have been at least six
[868/1000]	" what does that mean ? " " i do n't think any of the women have been married . i think they 've both been waiting for the right guy , and they wanted you for the special
[869/1000]	" he 's out there , " jamie said . " we have to try . " " when we get to the bottom of this hole , there wo n't be a hole on earth , " jamie
[870/1000]	" what ? ! " cried mike . then she smiled . " they give out small bands like this sometimes . sometimes they do , sometimes they do not . " she let the sheet fall back
[871/1000]	i had to agree with the old man . and i could n't imagine why i 'd done either . " i think we can give him a few hours to sleep , " the nurse said . "
[872/1000]	the man 's head bounced on the side like some kind of broken wind mill . his arms splayed out and his legs lay flat in the mud . he whimpered and took a step forward , but the water
[873/1000]	" what 's <EOS> and the people of the land . " the crowd grew as the storm rolled over the ship . there was a strange , high whine as it approached . it was n't a good sign
[874/1000]	" he told me about the accident . it seemed like a great thing to do . but i did n't want to talk about it . it should n't be that way between us , " james said .
[875/1000]	i shrug and force another sip of my hot chocolate . " he 's a good guy , right ? " " yeah . he 's a better man , too , " she giggles . " it 's
[876/1000]	" we do not seek any kind of divine intervention . we would n't ask for it . " " i respect you for your courage . but so should you . your faith in the cause you 've

[879/1000]	' no , not at all ma'am . you 're not going to have to worry about that for a while . but i want to go through your files really quick and tell you what i learned from mr.
[880/1000]	" how can i describe a man who would willingly take a life without anyone to help him ? " she watched the man at his desk stop to study the woman in question . with a tilt of
[881/1000]	" i had a lot of practice , and i got into that . " " yeah . " i looked up at his profile . " it 's good i 'm getting that off my chest . "
[882/1000]	" no . but if you had , you might have been the only girl . of all the guys i 've slept with , there was always one back then . i do n't even remember what his name
[883/1000]	i nod . " i know i ca n't speak for her . i do n't want to give her anything more time . " " so you 're a man who respects women . " a woman

[885/1000]	" yes , princess . " we were holding hands so i could feel his warmth and steady the shaking that had settled in the pit of my stomach at his name . " what 's wrong , blake
[886/1000]	" sorry , " she said , pulling back abruptly . " i ca n't . " " look , do n't do this . we 'll get married in april , after we can get married and have
[887/1000]	" well , well , well , " he murmured . " your friend has arrived . " his eyes drifted back in her direction and he saw the shock and horror on her face . " who
[888/1000]	he said , " yes , i 'm my father . " * * * peter looked at his father , " i 'm not ready . " " he 's older than you , father ,
[889/1000]	" wow , this is nice . you know how she was at sea level . she was n't all that good at everything . " " no , she was n't . especially since her first time .
[890/1000]	her expression turned to one of horror . " you 're not taking my seat , are you ? " he was standing a couple of feet away from me , waiting for me to back up . i
[891/1000]	she felt nothing . she was filled with hate , rage , and - all of it , an alien rage - and had to resist it . the hatred was better directed at him than at herself . she
[892/1000]	for two reasons , jack was determined to find out what sort of mood she was in . but the last thing he needed tonight was two more people around him . fortunately , their arrival at the restaurant
[893/1000]	" hey , it 's me . " " i 'm glad you 're coming , i 'm glad you 're here . happy thanksgiving , i 'm happy you 're getting to be with your dad one more
[894/1000]	i do n't come into contact with a lot of his family , but he made no move to be included in their company . after he died , it was very difficult for me to find anyone to talk
[895/1000]	" what 's yours ? " asked david , ignoring the question . " it 's not mine , " said jane . " it 's yours . " " it 's nothing , really , " said
[896/1000]	" yes , i know that , " he said , smiling slightly . though , of course , if it had been anyone else but simon who 'd answered he might have thought he sounded less than sincere .

[902/1000]	" i 'm in a hurry . " i snapped my fingers in front of the girl 's face . she flinched but continued with her breakfast . " why are you chewing on your lower lip ? "
[903/1000]	" like hell ! " the old lady screamed , so loud that the entire church shook . " get this , you little son of a bitch ! i know how and when my daughter dies - and that
[904/1000]	i could n't understand why my father would let this happen . i asked for privacy . with my mom over , she 'd be forced to leave the hospital alone with my dad <EOS> , i was sure of
[905/1000]	" for what ? " i asked . " for not being able to see the truth . you need to see it then you need to see me do something for it . " " i ca
[906/1000]	" what is it ? " i asked , trying to peek through the hole . " do n't make a sound . do n't go anywhere near there . the only way out is through the door to

[908/1000]	she leaned back . a grin curled his lips . " ah , yes . " she exhaled and licked her lips . " what are you gon na do ? " his gaze swept back to
[909/1000]	" what 's that ? " one of the regulars asked behind me as i set my hat and gloves on the counter . i glanced from the dirty mug to him and back again . " nothing ,
[910/1000]	" but ! " i pleaded . " i wo n't leave you . i need you now more than ever . " he could n't deny me ; he could n't keep his mouth shut either . his
[911/1000]	" i have to go . but do n't cry . i 'm waiting for a call from the police . if you find out what happened to your child ... " i kissed him again , almost in
[912/1000]	" no , " i said , looking at him . " why not ? " how did i say it ? then i realized what i was thinking . " because you should be running away
[913/1000]	" i do n't have any better ideas , " she muttered as she moved away from him . " how was your trip to paris ? " he asked . " so far very well , though
[914/1000]	" and so all in all , a rather boring trip . " " i can see why your dad chose the home we have , but i am just trying to work this out before we stay in
[915/1000]	" i 've also been working in the lab , and i 've used the one at the house in the desert and the mountains , so it 's pretty old . i think i 've passed most of the
[916/1000]	as we started across the compound , we heard it all - the gunshots , the scream , the squeal of tires as our vehicle exploded . * * * now , i 'm doing this an even
[917/1000]	although he probably did n't realize what i 'm doing to him , he 's so enthralled by my hand that he lets me continue to caress him with it . it 's no long , slow retreat . it

[922/1000]	' yes . she would . is your father there ... with you ? ' he had to call my father . and my mother . ' no , ' he said . ' he 's not
[923/1000]	" no . my dad would probably break that bitch 's neck . besides , i never have to worry about anything like a broken arm , you know how my stepdad is . " " that 's true
[924/1000]	" i do n't suppose i can say that 's too bad , " he remarked . " i bet some of it is n't very well versed . " " i 've never been much of a drinker
[925/1000]	" never . you 'll never find out . " she laughed . " good for you . i 'll bet she loves you like a brother , " she said smugly . a smirk crept up his
[926/1000]	" damn . " before he realized what he was doing , he rose to his feet and reached for the bar on the wall . he pulled his gaze away from her long enough to reach for a
[927/1000]	i stared at her blankly . her eyes flared . " yes , really , it is true . " she breathed heavily <EOS> ... like a horse . " my prince . like in the stories .
[928/1000]	" no , and i was n't going to tell you any of it . i just think it 's time i told something to help me along . will you marry me so i can go to college ?
[929/1000]	it was something she 'd learned a long time ago . they could n't take a chance on breaking the truth . a lie was good . " that guy out there ... " max pushed away from the
[930/1000]	please . please . " oh , we 'll still watch the movie . " <EOS> fucking beautiful woman with the long , white curls that shimmered like copper in the dim light of my room . "
[931/1000]	" i think you will be doing a lot more than having a party , " she teased . " well , if you 've already figured out it 's me , then surely it 's time for me
[932/1000]	he kept his eyes planted on the door and his lips moving with silent , unheard conversation . " what ? " she shrieked and he looked to her to see her face was now pale and twisted with
[933/1000]	you had to know that was n't it . " " of course not . but it did help . can you imagine what he 'd have said if he knew it and you 'd been lying to him
[934/1000]	still , it was better than any previous night spent alone in the room with her . " fine . after my shower . " i pressed a kiss to her neck again . " there 's a bottle
[935/1000]	" look , " i said . " if he really tries , he can track me the rest of the way . " i held up the card and saw that it was a photo of a vampire
[936/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " she said quietly , wishing that things could have gone differently . " i never should have been here . " " so , you got over it , " he said ,
[937/1000]	" what are you talking about ? you heard it ; he thought he found his mother 's body . " " he probably did ... he talked her into it . but i asked him that once before
[938/1000]	" will you stay with me until i give you my word nothing will happen to you ? " she implored . he leaned over and placed his hands on her cheeks and gently parted her lips . without
[939/1000]	i wanted him . my mouth , my breasts , my stomach . his hands and c * ck , and my tongue , and his mouth , all of who was me . i wanted him . i
[940/1000]	this was the best , most beautiful moment of my entire life . and as i watched her , watching her face flush with passion , and her muscles tighten around me and her eyes glaze and her breath hitch
[941/1000]	" she looks much better . " there was a hint of regret in his voice . " i thought you said she was fine . " i did n't mention the injury to my shoulder . i did
[942/1000]	' do you mind if i smoke by myself ? ' ' that 's ok ; i have a few cigarettes myself anyway . ' ' look , do you mind if i ask what you 're up
[943/1000]	what had he said to go with your words , so that one minute we were out dancing at her house , and the next we were going home with him ? for what seemed like the hundredth time ,
[944/1000]	" yes , we are , but you 'll be busy making sure we do n't meet . " she knew that he was holding back on her for his " other " reason and it was frustrating .
[945/1000]	" maybe you should sit down , " i said . he dropped down onto the couch beside me . there was a pause . our eyes met , mine as black and cold as a stormy ocean .
[946/1000]	a moment later , he had the front door of the shop open . before the bolt 's closure was closed , he could hear the door latch . he took off at a run , not looking back
[947/1000]	they looked at one another from where she sat and grinned . chapter 2 the girls ' first day on vacation , it was as if a giant switch had been thrown : an adult and a child
[948/1000]	" i 've seen you ? " said the woman . " at the beach , " said esk , remembering . " i 'm - " there was a bang as something thudded through the rock above .
[949/1000]	" how did you find me ? " " you are n't <EOS> -- you 're my -- you -- or of course , your dad " ( again . ) ' " my mom and i have been
[950/1000]	" who ? " the young man 's dark eyes met hers . " my sire . " at least she knew it was n't in the vamp 's mind . if she was in any danger ,
[951/1000]	" he has very powerful weapons , your majesty . they wo n't harm me . " king happen stance and his companions looked at king ashton . queen kay l n took a shaky breath . "
[952/1000]	" we 'll keep you updated . " " a new guy ? " " yeah . and if he asks you anything , i 'll be in touch . " " alright , " she says
[953/1000]	and her voice rose . " i hope you think about it . i very well may make you regret your choice . " and then she walked away . the door closed with a flat thump ,
[954/1000]	please come back , i beg you . i do n't know what 's going on , but i need you . please come back . chapter 17 " what in god 's name has gotten into you
[955/1000]	" does anyone else know about this ? or is it just me ? " " nope . if that 's the case it 's because a number of us know . " he sighed heavily . "
[956/1000]	my gaze dropped to the floor . i was thankful that my socks were already packed , though . they were the only thing that covered me right at the moment . " when was it ? " "
[957/1000]	' i see , the problem is you have your own experience of these things . ' ' yes , ' i said softly . ' but it does n't bother me any . ' ' and is
[958/1000]	i raised an eyebrow . " do you suppose that means i can be a lot more fun to play with if i 'm not playing with the men who want me around ? " " like i said
[959/1000]	" no thanks , " i said flatly . now that i was a new woman , he seemed nervous around me , which made me nervous as well . i 'd had boyfriends , had watched them do stupid
[960/1000]	" well , do n't count on it . " * * * * * " here it is , " the guard said finally , and turned to the two guards taking him to the interrogation room
[961/1000]	" okay , but only after dinner . " " sure , " they said in unison . they all shared a bottle of french wine and ate while they ate . <EOS> , one by one ,

[963/1000]	" what was in the bag ? " i almost told him , but was distracted by a memory that had lingered in my mind while i slept . chapter twenty - nine a note i
[964/1000]	" no , i mean no , it was n't you . if he looked like the real deal , why do you think he 's doing so ridiculous things ? " " maybe he 's doing it for
[965/1000]	i was a coward . a coward who 'd f * * ked up miserably . i 'd set hope 's heart free again , but i 'd broken a promise to a woman who would n't live up
[966/1000]	i turned to the floor , picking at my boot . " yeah , i guess , " i said . " and i ca n't see my arm hurting and he wo n't hurt me . " i thought
[967/1000]	" hey , hey , hey , take a deep breath . it 's okay . " a half - grin pulled at his lips . he drew toward her , and she placed her palms on the wall
[968/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said . " are you really ? " she gasped . " i - i am so sorry , garion . " he could feel her tears burning the backs of his
[969/1000]	" i was going to get you all . " he said as he lifted my chin . his smile faltered for a second . he pulled back and stood up straight . " you can see the way i
[970/1000]	' no , ' i say nervously . ' so where was yesterday ? ' he puts his finger to his lips , ' shhh ... it 's not real . it 's a fantasy . ' i
[971/1000]	" my father always worried all the time about the curse , did n't he ? " " i 'm not one of his soldiers , " he says , the anger in his voice and cheeks starting a
[972/1000]	" you 're my best friend - " she interrupted her as i pushed my food around on my plate . " i mean i really miss you . you 've been doing so much for me lately -
[973/1000]	" and how did these friends join the ranks of the enemy ? ' asked the general , putting an end to the conversation , since it was at long last over . " i do n't know .
[974/1000]	" yes ? " " remember you 've got a job for me . " " who ? " " one of the guys from the agency . " his shoulders slumped . " i 'm

[980/1000]	" yeah it is , i 'm just not sure if it 's been picked up from here yet . " " what in the world did you give up for them ? " " if i knew
[981/1000]	" hey , are they all dead , too ? " i asked . my body shook in nervousness . i must have seemed that way because he stared back at me , his expression grim and unreadable .
[982/1000]	' no , because people will be all over him until he gets his head where it belongs , ' said angua . ' you do n't have to be a sybil to help people not understand . '

[985/1000]	" is he going to bite it ? " " no . " i laughed . " well , i 'm sure you two would make really great guys . " " good point , but he
[986/1000]	what he was saying made sense . it was not a question , but it was there nonetheless . i just had to tell someone of his connection . all that the public had done was make my friend suspect

[989/1000]	" i wish he was . " i replied quietly . " that was good , what happened in there ? " " there was just too much drama . " i replied in a small voice .
[990/1000]	" oh , sweetie , i 'm fine . my fingers are swollen shut and i was afraid . i 'm just a little shaken up and i was afraid you 'd never talk to me again . "
[991/1000]	" i 'm going to make you a promise , " she muttered , glaring at him . " no more fucking around and getting in a fight . are we clear ? " " yes . "
