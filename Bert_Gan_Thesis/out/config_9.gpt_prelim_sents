[0/1000]	i knew from personal experience that they paid out a lot to get rich , but after all of these years , it was still a relatively small enterprise . so i was n't prepared to cash in the billions
[1/1000]	" his heart is weak - his stamina is , for that matter , aby smal . " " he 's in a medic ally - enhanced condition , " said dr. sock , " and he does n't
[2/1000]	" yes . " he started from the first word and then i looked at him . he was looking at me like i was f * * king the planet . " so ? that means ...
[3/1000]	' ok ? ' ' ok ... ' ' ok ? ' ' ok .. because it 's your house . ' ' why ? are you sick ? ' ' no , i 'm
[4/1000]	" no , i 'm fine , sweetie . " " then why are n't you holding my hand and telling me you love me and will never leave me ? " i had to admit that no
[5/1000]	" fine by me . you did n't get it until the last minute or so , you were n't ready . " he rubbed his stubble and pulled me tighter against him . i could feel his erection
[6/1000]	" do i get to wear this dress ? " she asked . " yes . " there was more about him she could n't describe , but it did exist . he had a reputation that had him
[7/1000]	" what you had planned with the dogs on tuesday ? " he frowned the idea . " well , they wo n't say what i hope not to be . besides , we all agreed we could n't
[8/1000]	but when the door shut behind him , she let the spell of the night and her magic seep out the other side . oh ... why had she done that ? why had she listened to hope again
[9/1000]	i felt the warmth fall over me as he exhaled and then he pressed his forehead into the top of my head . " i 'm sorry , katie . i 'm so sorry for giving this to you .
[10/1000]	and of course , of course , she knew . chapter twenty - six as they rode through the wintry fog to her apartment , bronte 's head was swimming with fear and longing waves that she knew
[11/1000]	he grinned . " then i guess i 'll take advantage of the fact that you 're stuck with me at the dance . " " i should hope so . " she could afford a car , right
[12/1000]	" what do you mean ? " i asked , confused . " nothing , let me finish . when my brother found out he was dead , and he took his own life , he sent a message
[13/1000]	the doors of the plane closed . the hum of power lines and engines faded into the background , leaving only the sound of wind and the rush of the ocean . when the plane landed around four a.m.
[14/1000]	" a - " " do not worry , " he interrupted . " i will speak to miss f lit worth , and she will fetch you any assistance you can . " he nodded toward the lady
[15/1000]	" how can you ... ? " his words suddenly turned into questions . " this sounds crazy ... " " i know no crazy . " max came into the room , having obviously heard it again
[16/1000]	slowly he moved lower until he could whisper against her lips . " i want love . i want everything . please , jayne . i ca n't wait any longer . " she sucked her breath in
[17/1000]	but he could n't tell where the phone line was , since all the wires were cut out along the edges of the building . he had no way of communicating to both himself and the person in charge ,
[18/1000]	" how much does he want you to hold ? " " his life is my father 's life , " he says simply . " oh , sweetie . this wo n't be as bad as you
[19/1000]	" yes , " he agreed , and pulled us down onto the porch beside him . chapter thirteen hunter moved into the first seat of my cab as i unlocked my car door . that day ,
[20/1000]	there is one thing she knows too - that he is a bastard daughter of the alpha . that he and his pack have been spreading their lies on her aunt 's ranch . that wolf should have warned her
[21/1000]	" can you do it ? " cole heard that familiar voice and saw him holding the rock . he took a step back . matt held the rock . " yes . " " i 'm sure
[22/1000]	he lowered his head , then let out a groan as fresh desire shot through him . " you okay ? " she asked as she tried to soothe the hurt from the kiss he 'd given her ?
[23/1000]	" that , and not having a man 's voice in your head all the time . " i 'm still a virgin . how dare she even suggest it ? she sighs . " sorry . it came
[24/1000]	" it 's true , " he said . " i 've been with her just five years . " " i should n't have even told you about her . " " i ca n't fault you
[25/1000]	" well , you 're safe - or as safe as they come . " " what do you mean ? " " the demon - child . if it can come looking for you , it will
[26/1000]	but i was n't sure what i was thinking . " did these come from my husband ? " jack 's face split into a wide - eyed grin . " well good , " he said ,
[27/1000]	" no , as we 'd best not talk about that again , " came the voice of a uniformed messenger for the commander . " come , commander , the commander is awaiting you on your second floor .
[28/1000]	" uh oh , " i said , pressing the button to open the door . " what ? " glancing back into the car , i was dismayed to find that she was laughing and shaking her
[29/1000]	the doctor moved to her side , held her hand . " you 're not going to faint , are you ? " " no , " she answered . " just relax , " said nurse er
[30/1000]	there would always be a thread of hope . it was only a question of how much of what happened here was true , that the knowledge that she was now part of the hunt , and that she
[31/1000]	it was right on the line . when she made the connection with the person , she felt a little woozy , almost as if someone hit her with a baseball bat . she had to blink several times
[32/1000]	she had n't said more than two words to me since she first walked into this new life . she 'd already spent so much time in here for the past six months before i 'd come and asked for
[33/1000]	" then good luck , " i say . " i 'll see you soon . " i quickly leave the garden and slip back to the house , where i knock on the door and knock again .
[34/1000]	" it 's not that bad , " cassie said , looking the way that alice had looked when the girl had taken the first deep breath , staring at the ceiling . it was ... not , <EOS>
[35/1000]	" just doing my job , " i said and let my focus wander , which was just as dangerous when my mind was preoccupied . the woman behind the counter , old - lady jane , gave
[36/1000]	" you told her that ? " " no . i did n't want to let him die , " i said . " the good news is , she wo n't remember . in fact , i felt
[37/1000]	" it 's the time for making love . " " you can tell me later , " i say , still looking away . " not until we 've made love again . " logan pulls on
[38/1000]	" the rest of you , go back to business , " jamie ordered , not bothering to hide the disapproval he felt toward his own people . ian and ian had started the fire that evening , after
[39/1000]	" he 's dead , " she said just as firmly , turning to leave . " he 's dead . " chapter 15 an hour later , the sun had fully faded to a comfortable glow above
[40/1000]	" yeah , well , i 'll be honest , i was thinking about what you said . and i 've never really wanted anything more in my entire life . i could spend my whole life just just sitting
[41/1000]	and a tiny , invisible thread of energy was pulling at her , urging her to follow it . she began to feel the effects of the dream . her eyes could move even if she were hypnotized .
[42/1000]	i got to the barn and found mrs. fitz roy 's chevy . the door was unlocked and my legs were shaking so badly i was glad i did n't bend them under me . i slowly walked out to
[43/1000]	" you know what it means , that i care . " " i guess . " what more could he say ? she was just a few feet away , leaning casually against the kitchen counter , and
[44/1000]	" no , it 's okay . " they both fell into silence . he could n't believe she came here . his gut clenched at the thought of facing her . he did n't know what to say
[45/1000]	this is why i am the leader . " * * * " the humans will hate you , " i say to aden outside of the training hall . his expression is somber and he begins
[46/1000]	but as they strode toward the park , their heads made no conscious decision not to stray far from the safety of their companion . chapter 13 she was n't the only one to share the journey with
[47/1000]	" good work , " replied simon , impressed . " now , " said simon walking through to front and onto the road on the opposite side of the road . " do i get a word in
[48/1000]	" i 'm glad it 's over , " i told him . he nodded , his eyes never leaving mine . " it 's over , " he repeated . " i could say the same about
[49/1000]	i sat beside him on the bed and watched him sleep . i slipped out the knife and his eyes opened to see me , not with concern but at last . he recognized me as his sister and i
[50/1000]	she sat up on her elbows and the covers slipped down his back . he put the tray on the side table and slid his leg across hers . " do n't push yourself too hard during the
[51/1000]	" why is the man with them all in attendance ? " she asked , trying to figure out why a rich english lady would come for a visit . " do they have business to attend to ? "
[52/1000]	i gasped , a slow , sharp moan crawling from my throat . " you 're not taking me home with you . " aiden looked at me like i was crazy . " she 's not . "
[53/1000]	she was not the only girl growing up with the same family as him and he felt like he was the only one . there had once been a great family , but after his parents had died and his
[54/1000]	" and ... ? " " nothing , " she said with a small smile . she lifted her hand to his cheek and tilted his chin up as she gazed into his eyes . " as long as
[55/1000]	" i like a good old - fashioned way to play my guitar ! " she said , waving a hand in the air in mock dismissal . " at least in that one song . " " i
[56/1000]	" well , i do n't think so . " we stopped at a bakery and bought some produce . i made sure to buy the biggest piece of fruit i could . for dessert , i bought one
[57/1000]	the man at the desk was tall and slender , with an impressive mustache , black suit , and a dark red tie . " i 'm afraid i do n't have a problem with that , " he said
[58/1000]	it was a small world out in the real world . i leaned across it . nick said she had called the cops for me . " nah , i 'm okay , do n't worry about me
[59/1000]	" but i keep thinking this is it . i 'm going in . " she turned around and hurried into the bathroom . " damn , i did n't hear you come in . " " this is
[60/1000]	in a flash , my body exploded with motion . my stomach , my feet , and my head went up and i raced forward , my arms blazing . i could hear the others scrambling behind me .
[61/1000]	" it is n't so common ; not every young couple is married , " said the soldier , looking at his watch . when she continued , he gave her " a small talk " . " where
[62/1000]	after lunch , they drove to the park . both women drank lemonade and talked about everything and nothing at all . the ride was interminable . " are you sure you do n't want to go back to
[63/1000]	" to make a long story short , " i explained , " all three of us ended up in foster care . " mr. solomon opened his mouth and said nothing , but i knew he was thinking
[64/1000]	" i 've heard of it from his mouth , " he managed . " but i would prefer to know what you think . " " go ahead and ask me anything . " he was n't
[65/1000]	" well , it is , but we 're going back to bed . " he walked to the water 's edge , the sky lightening , then the moon came full . inside , he could barely see
[66/1000]	no ! how did he do it ? how ? where , how , what ... his eyes blazed . she gasped as the flames of pure desire seared her , sending flames streaking up her back and her
[67/1000]	as i was about to let go of him , the rest of his skin slid away and to the side . my hand tightened painfully around his wrist and he moved with so much power that the ground beneath
[68/1000]	" we were working in a warehouse in the city . i stayed out of sight for a few days until things cooled down . at least that 's what i thought . the security guards and the crew kept
[69/1000]	" why would he come here ? " i asked . he paused a moment , breathing deeply , but when he spoke , his voice was still very cautious . " he 's taking the young lady
[70/1000]	' i do n't want to see the look in your eyes when you find out i was right . ' ' it wo n't surprise jesse any , ' i tease . he laughs briefly . '
[71/1000]	i could n't help but smile at that one . " you 're a smart girl , " i said , grabbing his arm and pulling him into me for a kiss . he returned my kiss , barely
[72/1000]	" i 'll never stop , " he said , putting his head against mine and nuzzling my neck . " it is what it is . " " we could n't be together if you were n't really
[73/1000]	" oh my god , this is embarrassing me . " " i just hope they do n't have a bunch of guys waiting at your place in the meantime and come home , " i smiled , making
[74/1000]	everyone tried to stay out of the way of the crowd , pushing through to allow more room to move to the field . but i had already passed a row of stands with a row of seats , so
[75/1000]	" you found your way here , " he teased . " so i feel lucky . " he shook his head and continued searching the room . i followed him over to the couch where some red ,
[76/1000]	' i know . ' ' do you really ? but you told me you 're old enough to know better . ' she sniffed . ' i 'll do my best not to be an idiot ,
[77/1000]	" like i told you before , i understand , ms. daniels . i 'll - wait ... did you say you 've seen these ? " she nodded . " right . i was going to call
[78/1000]	" you need it , " he replied . and in the wake of his sudden smile , he went back to his work . " it 's nice of you to ask , " i returned . "
[79/1000]	" so , that 's really you ? " i asked her . " yes , that 's me ! i 'm , " julia said . " you got ta come stay here for christmas . at a
[80/1000]	then i threw my head back and burst into a smile . " god , thank you . " she grinned back . then she leaned in and kissed me , her tongue sweeping inside my mouth
[81/1000]	* * * as i rounded the corner i noticed a giant man standing at the open door . he wore tight pajama pants , revealing a tattoo of a hawk circling a black - winged eagle who was
[82/1000]	his hand left the phone . his fingers locked around it so tight she made out his fingers . she screamed again . then she saw him move . he turned in his dream and she screamed
[83/1000]	you and i , i would go to a place like the bel marsh academy and you would not live to see another day . we would be married . i told you we 'd take a walk on
[84/1000]	she was close - in bed once more , eyes closed , and in the morning the whole world came to a standstill entirely , and the world went quiet . <EOS> the shower had gone , and the world
[85/1000]	he was still looking down onto the girl that had once stood before him , but her death and the pain he had killed had been part of his fate . her death did not change anything for him .
[86/1000]	" do n't tell me , " he said . " because i am very old . " " no , you are n't old . you have two lives , two days and hours , and then you
[87/1000]	" i know , " i whisper . " i know . i love you , too . " i do n't need to look up to know the shock that crosses his face as he stares down at
[88/1000]	" have you ever met a woman who could be more adorable ? " i asked this because i had and was happy to share such a profound response . he 'd earned it . " yeah , "
[89/1000]	" because you think something horrible will happen to me . you do n't know it , but it would happen to any female now . you would be like any other man . a plaything to be paid for
[90/1000]	" what ? ? " he asked in confusion . " the one who tried to rape you , " she told him . " w - what ? " when he continued to stare at her ,
[91/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " i said . i looked at him for the first time since i 'd walked into the room , and then i looked at the photo there . there was a flash of
[92/1000]	" do n't you trust me . " " you 're making me nervous , " he lied . he hated being the bearer of bad news . hated not having company when he 'd get on a plane
[93/1000]	" of course he does , " she cooed to me , " you 're looking great , hon . " i frowned at her , my words tumbling out of me . " how long did you get
[94/1000]	" you 're right , she might have a right to die on a daily basis . " " a good deed never goes un punished . " i said seriously . " at that moment , i do
[95/1000]	' you were so beautiful , ' he whispered , and i almost melted out of my skin . everything was turning and i wanted to dive into him . ' and so damned sweet . ' ' oh
[96/1000]	' not one of them have escaped , i think . i think , the way they flew into the woods that first time ! ' ' they ? ' my curiosity was piqued . ' the two
[97/1000]	" she died of en nu i . " " why ? " " i think it was something the elders of the necro s planned to do . but , " i continued , " the necro
[98/1000]	" not just any old man - " " i know . " he reached over and gripped her hand . jessie 's breath caught . " i 'm sorry , " she whispered . " for
[99/1000]	mr. hec ker man seemed to calm down after a moment of stillness from the kids . " where are you going , doc ? " " home , " she responded . " alright " he looked
[100/1000]	" wait , " someone said . " he can do that ? " " yeah . i 'm not trying to pick a fight with you . i just wanted to ask how much you guys know about
[101/1000]	" what ? " " that whole morning , when you started in on me . did i say something ? " " n - no . " he laughed lightly . " i 'm just trying to
[102/1000]	and i took care of most of it . too bad i missed the second part . i missed the thing i needed to get out of my head . i needed it to go away while it was fresh
[103/1000]	" i am <EOS> of the great choice . the best for the biggest thing . the top of the biggest thing but , when you 're the only way it can happen , like the hardest ,
[104/1000]	she was n't really sure herself . she wanted a man who made her want to wrap her legs around him and never get away again . she still had no idea how to feel afterward . she had
[105/1000]	the guard was in his early twenties . he put me on the ground by pushing a barrel under me . he whispered , " just try not to piss your pants , and when you come out , all
[106/1000]	" i met him once . so did he . he was cool . " " oh , " said the dark - haired woman . " what did you say his name was ? " " jake
[107/1000]	" i know something you do . " a pause on his end . " very well . " " this conversation is over , professor . " " oh , i 'm right back ! i
[108/1000]	" see ? " i said triumphantly , shaking my head . " he 's the good guy . not you . " " yeah , but ... " " they 're like brothers . no brother should
[109/1000]	" how could she mean that ? " " she said she had to find out why you were different . she said you were special . and she said she needed to know when you were alone .
[110/1000]	" how did he die ? " " i wish i knew . but i 'll let him have one of the first things he wishes : the land . " the ground beneath her began to move
[111/1000]	" i did , " kate said . " in 17 92 . i 've used it a lot during my stay here because it 's the only place the house has something that looks like it 's going to
[112/1000]	" sorry for taking you home , " i say . " i 'll do my best to get an idea about where it is . " " it 's the black ridge , is n't it ? "
[113/1000]	you take a good look at this one . " i went to his bed , got down on my hands and knees in front of it , pulled a shirt over my head , tossed it to the
[114/1000]	' i know . i saw it on the news . ' ' it 's never happening again , ' i whisper . ' what ? i do n't understand . ' ' i ca n't look
[115/1000]	" oh , sure . " he turned towards his grandfather . " i 'm sure johnny would n't mind if you lived here . he 's much easier to get along without being surrounded by kids .
[116/1000]	" did you see those ? " he shook his head , then straightened . " okay , let me close my eyes . yes , i guess you were right . these days you ca n't catch me completely
[117/1000]	the young officer was n't deterred . " no problem . i 'll see you in the morning , " he said . " good . " joe got to his feet . " i know where to find
[118/1000]	i start to say yes , but he starts whispering , speaking in low tones . " there 's a door in the next room , " he whispers . " i could call it down to and wait
[119/1000]	" but i think that if we use it , we will find it , as they know better than we do . it is more than a part of the game , and it is an extension of us
[120/1000]	" hey , you . " i grin down at her , still holding onto her hand . " hi , baby , " she 's still smiling down at me . my heart is like little birds ,
[121/1000]	" what 's so special about you ? " i asked . he lowered his eyes and rested them on the table . " you know , i would like to take you to my place in my mind
[122/1000]	" when is this thing in ? " " march . " " as soon as i can get back ? " " do i need to ask what ? " " why i wo n't
[123/1000]	" well , let 's get started , " mr. thompson said . he turned and turned to his laptop . " let 's get started right away . " with that , he started typing . " i
[124/1000]	" it 's a start , " his mother said , kissing his cheek . with a wave , he headed for the door - no , run , like he could outrun the herd . he did n't
[125/1000]	a gust of wind blew against it but came from the mountains beyond . he ran off into the woods , his knees quaking and his breath whistling in little wheezing puffs . his eyes were on the walls
[126/1000]	one by one , they were killed by the demons . " i don't know anything about it , " she said , but she looked down at the unconscious soldiers . her mother had died of a heart
[127/1000]	" we have a lot of questions , " i said , letting my gaze shift , still holding his . " but for now , i 'm going to try to talk some sense into your head . can
[128/1000]	i looked up at her again . " you got something in your eye , ava , i can tell by your jaw muscles . you got something you want to tell me ? " i blinked and
[129/1000]	but no matter everything , no matter what he said , she knew he was right . she simply could n't do it . she pushed back from his chest , stared at him . he put himself
[130/1000]	he nods . " yeah - about that ... " i shake my head . " i have to call mom . i 'll be back to visit monday . talk to you soon ! " " night
[131/1000]	" but i did n't get the job , " she insisted . " i do n't even recall when i signed it or when i signed the contract . " " that 's not my problem . you
[132/1000]	that was when the rest of the room began . chapter 16 chapter 17 chapter 18 chapter 19 chapter 20 chapter 21 chapter 22 chapter 23 chapter 24 chapter 25
[133/1000]	he kept his eyes on his wife as she walked around the bed , opening a drawer in the night stand . he was so close to her body . his arm still curled around her waist , his
[134/1000]	" are you okay ? " " yes . " " please tell me what would make you feel better . " " i guess i 'm not quite ready to know . " " let
[135/1000]	" you better watch out , sweetheart , " he said . " that 's a knife to the throat . " cassie giggled , still trying not to cry . nick kissed her and sighed once more
[136/1000]	i was n't all that surprised to find that one of his other two guns was on the floor . it was a bad habit of his . " oh shit , " i said , still watching his
[137/1000]	" for what ? " he frowns . " for everything . " i shake the thoughts away . " no , i know , i just want you to know i 'm here , and i 'm
[138/1000]	" no , no , no , " said mrs. owens . " none of that . please go and have a hot bath . i 'm afraid you left me with a terribly unpleasant customer today . "
[139/1000]	i take her hands , and she looks up into my eyes . " i have my mom , " she says , " but she died when i was seven . " i pull her into me
[140/1000]	a lot of the time he thought back to the night before , when the whole town had descended into chaos . everyone at the store had reacted poorly , but mostly he was just watching to see if something
[141/1000]	with the memory of the image of the beautiful woman behind him all but forgotten , he took a moment to smile . when he turned , he was confronted with three women seated on his balcony , their
[142/1000]	" you do n't need to ask me twice , " i said sweetly . " though , you go , girl . " she frowned . " i 'm being ridiculous , so i just take your word
[143/1000]	" yes , i know . " he opened the front door and turned to go back . " it 's over , " he said . " it 's over ? i just fell . i 'm
[144/1000]	you must know the story . " i watched his face as he spoke . " you see , i believed her . i followed her the whole time . she led me to believe , to believe in her
[145/1000]	she did n't want to let it go ; it was too personal and important when it was part of some secret life behind her eyes . yet maybe he was right : maybe there was a part of her
[146/1000]	the sound of his voice sent another shock wave of hunger surging through her , nearly making her come . she opened her eyes . as she did so , she licked her lips . it took everything she had
[147/1000]	' we do n't have long . i 've heard the prophecy . ' ' i told you it 's useless ! he may have not even been there . it 's too soon to see . '
[148/1000]	" the last time you saw me , i was drunk and a whore , " she says , turning her face away . i know a bad day can happen to her tonight . " so were i.
[149/1000]	he could feel that , too , but he also knew that whatever he thought of his current situation , one thing was certain : he needed to work as hard as he could to come up with this whole
[150/1000]	she was n't going to apologize . she was n't going to run from this conversation or get a second chance . not after the way he 'd made her feel . maybe he had n't meant it then
[151/1000]	" i do n't know , " she says and i know she 's lying . " i 'm not sure what to do . it 's not my thing . " her hair is covered in layers and
[152/1000]	" tell me we 're just friends . " " do n't mention it . " i smiled at ty . he looked at me as he pulled into the parking lot . i reached out and grabbed
[153/1000]	i got up from the bed . " so how 's it going ? " " is n't it a little late for me to be talking about my future ? " i nodded . " i
[154/1000]	" it will be a while before you see us again . you came home with barely a scratch . " " thanks , colonel . oh , uh , if you 're sure i can keep it ?
[155/1000]	she nodded . he lifted a hand in silent acknowledgment . " good . keep them alive . " " you 're being unfair . i - " he shot a cutting glance at the door behind
[156/1000]	" but she 's right about one thing sometimes " - his tone was softer , more pleading - " you 're my wife , and we need to marry . " " i can show you - "
[157/1000]	" we 'll find it , " i answered . " how long do you think we 'll be here ? " " some of the best time is when the work is done - " replied steve .
[158/1000]	" i 'm glad , " matt said softly . " i 'm glad you 're all right . " " i 'm not , " jane insisted , her tears falling freely . " there are others out
[159/1000]	" that 's your secret , " richard retorted . " he says i can look under the tarp if i like , " she said , " and i do n't . " " i 'll give
[160/1000]	" i need to be alone . " his hand closes around the doorknob . " yeah , i 'll go . " " do n't leave me , " i say . " please . i need

[162/1000]	" i was just thinking , " sarah said , rubbing her hand on her jean thighs , " it does n't really matter because she 's just as guilty as i am . " " still , "
[163/1000]	" what you have told me so far makes no sense . " " i thought i knew things after our conversation , but i did n't . and you were one of the few . you will not
[164/1000]	" please , " she pleads . he looks over at her in disbelief . " i need to hear about your day . " " i had my lunch out with my friend , " she says
[165/1000]	i thought of the boy and how young he appeared in my mind . in just over a day and half that i had n't noticed anything strange about him . " what reason do you have for seeking
[166/1000]	" they are a family of misfits and we find them to be very honest and understanding . they serve as our guides in the area , mainly through our organization , a little town on the border of the
[167/1000]	or if they did , it was a little in need of a good dousing . the door to my office opened . mom looked from me to joe , then her hand went to her mouth and
[168/1000]	when he moved to stand in front of her , she went still in panic . " do n't go anywhere , " he said . he picked up her hand and gave it a small squeeze . "
[169/1000]	" that 's very good , " she said , smiling . " you 've got a beautiful smile . you deserve it . " " thanks . that 's actually the nicest thing you 've said to me
[170/1000]	" thanks . " i took the file . " can i send you a letter ? " " please , " he offered . his hands , unlike ours , were blunt and his nails were n't as
[171/1000]	she looked down , watching his feet . " the same kind of thing . we 're different , and we 're each other 's family . " he paused , studying her , which made her want to reach
[172/1000]	i smile briefly . " i ca n't tell you how glad i am we found it . " a deep furrow wrinkles his forehead ; it 's almost comical . " who else was lost ? "
[173/1000]	" i do . " richard watched as the man pulled her jeans down past her hips , exposing her ass , which fit perfectly in the tight slacks . " and i had better see what my father has
[174/1000]	it had been a long time since he 'd held anyone when she could n't move . even if he was n't holding her . she did n't know what to say to that . did n't know
[175/1000]	my stomach clenched then melted as much as my body would . i was so nervous . did he mean we were making love ? there seemed to be no sound coming out of me . not even my breathing
[176/1000]	" you have an idea of what you are talkin ' about , correct ? " " a really good one . " " then why are your eyes red ? " " to cover it ,
[177/1000]	" of course i do , " he said , but she did n't hear him . no . before he could reach out and make sense of the events of thirty minutes ago , she 'd bolted up ,
[178/1000]	" no , it could only be a coincidence . that 's not the sort of thing that can be investigated anymore . it 's our job to figure out who did that to her , not to mention you
[179/1000]	" hey , boss , " said bryan , stepping forward . " my friend here told me he had already filled you in . " liz nodded and looked at luis . " are we up for the
[180/1000]	" do you think you can manage a bit of personal space ? we have a meeting going on in two minutes . " " okay . sorry about taking up so much of your day . "
[181/1000]	" good . " i had n't heard that since i saw the pictures on that gossip blog and i was stunned . because really , there was his future wife of fifteen years trying to convince him that
[182/1000]	" there 's a reason the people of the south will choose to pay a steep price for food and shelter . these small homes can not possibly feed many families . the village to the south must provide food
[183/1000]	she thought about it , then shrugged again , all too aware that she was wearing sexy panties . " i guess that 's what you want to know . " we are here now , rose .
[184/1000]	he 's looking at me in disbelief . " hell no . that boy is a pu * * y. " " is that another one of you who ca n't wait to be the first to see me
[185/1000]	" do you know who it is ? " " who are you ? " the old man shook his head . " no . " " then you are a shadow ... a shadow against the
[186/1000]	the guard glanced down at his watch , grunted , and stepped in front of the cart , pushing it toward the other side of the corral . he looked back at alex and said , " you and the
[187/1000]	" not entirely . " " it 's too far away . " " you 're forgetting one aspect of this mission , a possibility that might affect us all if we ca n't find the ship in
[188/1000]	all of a sudden , from in front of the camera , a man 's head came as <EOS> , a wooden legs , his head , and finally , standing erect , and then he looked like his brother
[189/1000]	he held it to his face as his tears trickled down his cheeks . " i do n't care . " she turned and put her arms around him . " i do n't , either . i just
[190/1000]	she came to the living room without having to be prodded into it and , looking out the corner of her eye , found that jim had no difficulty filling in the middle of the family room with the man
[191/1000]	" i 'm leaving first thing in the morning to go find jamie , then i 'll send some men to meet you , " she said . her lips parted to comment , then closed again .
[192/1000]	" do n't worry about that . i would n't ask if there were n't - " " they 're ready to open the arena , " my mom interrupts . " let 's stop walking now - we
[193/1000]	a smile spread across his face . " my love is my name , " he whispered from behind her . she flinched inwardly , hating the touch of his hand on her damp skin . the kiss
[194/1000]	" hey , i found it . " i looked up and found ty 's face right next to mine . i could say i had n't been paying that much attention to his body , but his perfect
[195/1000]	" do you think you have to be here five minutes ? i can wait ten . " she shook her head . " i 'm fine . i 'm going to go pick up the baby from alex
[196/1000]	emma flinched at the unexpected touch . " is something wrong ? " i asked , my mind starting to race . " does it make you feel uncomfortable ? " she had a sly smile . "
[197/1000]	" here and there , not yet . i do n't think so . but we 'll see . " " what are you implying ? " " in a manner of speaking , i do n't know
[198/1000]	" how bad ? " " you know ... you just do n't think about it enough . " " if it were worse my mind would be set on revenge . " " you could n't
[199/1000]	" because i have no idea why they need to know , " he growled , but his hands were on my hips , my hips , pulling me close . his mouth covered mine , and i tasted myself
[200/1000]	he was going to run with me into the woods . but i did n't feel safe on my own . i could n't trust her . i could n't remember why i had ever thought i could trust her
[201/1000]	suddenly , the door appeared , and with the sound of metal rubbing against metal and the squeak of another set of sliding chains , the massive door slowly opened . i jumped back from the door and pressed my
[202/1000]	but then , the door opened and the butler , mr. mac ta vish , entered the drawing room . in his arms was a man that andrew did not recognize -- not the sort of man he was used
[203/1000]	she raised an eyebrow at him . " a little help ? " he leaned over the counter again , his face close to hers . " i might be able to pull some strings to get a replacement
[204/1000]	he is trying to get in touch with his real son , but just do not even allow her to see that she is the source of all his emotions . but his self control is failing as she can
[205/1000]	she let the rest of the book fall to the bed and flopped into her pillows . opening the letter she read : dear lady stee ple ton - after reading it over , lady stee ple ton
[206/1000]	" you and i ? " he asked . " do n't tell me the last time i saw you was in college ? " " yes , " i replied . " i thought about it when i
[207/1000]	" take me home , " he said as if it were obvious . i leaned over at his side and pressed a kiss to his cheek , causing his lips to quiver . " are you sure you
[208/1000]	the rain came harder , making the snow fall even harder . no . no . no . i closed my eyes and clung to evan , refusing to open them as the agony of what
[209/1000]	" i have a job for your dad . if you want the job , by all means , do it . but you should keep it a secret , " she chided , smiling at him , the dimple
[210/1000]	" but it 's a lot closer than we can ever imagine . and our boss , that idiot john smith , and the rest of it 's totally un helpful . and since i do n't know how to
[211/1000]	" is that why i came ? " she said , smiling sweetly . " was it because of what i said ? i did n't realize how important you are . " " i guess it was ,
[212/1000]	" oh , right , and your name is ? " " um , mrs. grant , " she said with a very small smile . " mrs. grant , huh . i guess that 's what we
[213/1000]	this was the man who 'd given him the money to buy the new car . the man who 'd given him a chance to live . after his brother had died six years ago , vaughn had found
[214/1000]	she smiled at him . " i just want to know what you think . " he shrugged . " i know which way is down . " " and the other way ? " " i
[215/1000]	' what the hell have you done ? ' ' nothing , sir . but it might be your fault . ' ' how am i to use this situation ? ' ' you can give me
[216/1000]	i 've been thinking , but with these two together as a unit , i ca n't . because we 're going to have to kill him . i do n't want to , but if i do n't ,
[217/1000]	" what is it ? " " i should be thanking her . instead , i 'm pissed for a man who practically saved me . " " for pete 's sake , you did n't ask her
[218/1000]	" you know , when you 're an evil bitch in the world , you expect the worst . let me rephrase that . you expect the worst and you expect the best . right now , in this moment
[219/1000]	there was a huge hole in the door , one that must have been some kind of entrance ? inside , <EOS> a bit , or even had a secret , there was a little one like , it was
[220/1000]	" no . your hair , yes . mine , no . the color , oh , f * * k , " he mutters . " you came already , did n't you ? " " no ,
[221/1000]	" the black ghost is the third in the series , but even before my death a certain portion of the books have been published . what can we say ? the book gets talked about , and the critics
[222/1000]	she could feel them all around her , even the ones where she could n't see through her clothes , which were so damn heavy and old - fashioned , but that only made her want to hold on
[223/1000]	" all right , this is fine , " danny said . he took a couple steps back , but his nose did n't touch the ground . " alright , " john said , but he grabbed his
[224/1000]	i have n't decided on what to do so i wait in the carriage with the windows rolled down and the wind blowing from the south . i have all the time i need to think about all the things
[225/1000]	" i agree , " he had said . " we do n't need to . we came here for a reason . let 's be here for a reason . are you ready ? " " i
[226/1000]	she did n't know anything about him - he could pick and choose his battles , choosing his targets with so much care . she 'd known enough about men to know that men treated their women with some kind
[227/1000]	" do n't i always ? " i agreed . " then they 'll get it all figured out . i 'll take you for the long hike and i bet they do n't even get here until around
[228/1000]	though that meant that she had to face this , there were the dark emotions she struggled to contain . " hey , everything all right ? " " fine . " she could feel the tension thrumming
[229/1000]	" just let me handle it , " marcus said suddenly . the woman waved him away . " if only it were that simple , " she sighed , clearly frustrated . " i think it is
[230/1000]	" but to what end , eh ? " whispered lo , staring out at the clear blue lake through the front window of their small duplex . something had happened to him . something he could not quite
[231/1000]	" well , i feel like we should invite some other kids . " he pointed down the road to where tyler and his mom were . " yeah . that 's a few things . " i was
[232/1000]	<EOS> " oh ... good grief , " my mother hissed , her eyes flickering to where i stood . " you 're on edge . what were - ? " " shush , mother . " i clamped
[233/1000]	" ' so what will you do then ? ' " " he 'll stay here until the sun sets . '' i look into her eyes . " so what ... ? he 's just ... "
[234/1000]	i was so happy listening to him . he was holding us again , much better than he had last night , and i could n't tell him what was really bothering me . i let him hold me ,
[235/1000]	i say i 'm sorry . i wish i could take it back . there 's a pause , and then the voice says " thank you . " i 'm calling for my friends , i say
[236/1000]	the old man paused before speaking , " what i am about to tell you should stay between us . " the old man waited while the old man cleared his throat . the old man swallowed hard
[237/1000]	" that 's because you do n't have another child . " " so what ? " " so you 're still trying to protect me . only you failed , and so will i. " "
[238/1000]	after her daughter had left for school , a tearful laura found the room all to herself and a very unhappy james . ' i did n't know , laura . this makes no sense . ' '
[239/1000]	they settled in . " do n't be too hard on him , baby . " i tilted my head in a questioning way . " nothin' to be hard on . " i nodded .
[240/1000]	and then your son ... " " that 's what i was saying before you came into the room . " " good . you do n't have to say it again . " " it 's
[241/1000]	" can you see a trail ? " the giant man shook his head . " i think i 'll pass . " " let 's cross , " said gumshoe , " i want to check on
[242/1000]	this is one of the many reasons that i can be used for reading . if it were the only book in the world , i might be able to use it for my own comfort . " it
[243/1000]	" yeah , it 's the principle of the thing . " and i was going to f * * k the shit out of her tonight . i had no idea how to finesse this , though .
[244/1000]	" thanks , babe . " she nods eagerly , her lips curving into a satisfied grin as she steps over to me . " i could n't help but notice miss madison this morning , " she says
[245/1000]	i do n't have to tell her we were making out all night , because she 's already pulling me , pulling me toward her . i 'm just about to give in and taste that hot , wet mouth
[246/1000]	" it 's a plan , " matt said . " i ca n't tell how long that will last at this point . " " then do n't tell them until i 'm sure that all the guns

[250/1000]	her stomach muscles clenched at the thoughts . she had no idea what the hell was eating at her . just a few moments ago , she 'd been willing to ignore the sexual tension between them , but the

[252/1000]	" so ? " she gave him a sideways glance that suggested it was obvious . he 'd only mentioned the things she 'd forgotten , so it did n't matter . " so , " she said ,
[253/1000]	" and this is the king . " the king , my eyes were so tired and sore , i barely blinked my eyes after all the confusion . i looked around at the other men and the soldiers
[254/1000]	it was a little more than an hour later when he found an office complex that was n't far from where she was currently working . and he kept seeing her . he wanted some woman looking down at
[255/1000]	" are you going to tell me , then ? " she looked at him levelly . " yes . " and then , a little too calmly , she added , " yes , i am . "
[256/1000]	i watched in morbid fascination . i was n't here for the money , but i was so close to it . i felt so powerful , so in control , that it was hard for me to be alone
[257/1000]	" maybe your husband will know where you are . " she put her head on his shoulder and laughed . " you are always so silly . but i want to see my dad . i want to
[258/1000]	" <EOS> i had a plan . the best part is that this is so it 's a good idea with you and if it 's worked with the people in town it 's cool . i 'm talking about
[259/1000]	and so as the old gods came gathering up , to see whom the new gods would fall in love with , so too too did they come to see , in love with the new gods ; so all
[260/1000]	the light was dim in this stairwell , but the air was cool , and my heart beat faster as we passed the first floor and headed for the lower class classroom . " this is n't your first
[261/1000]	" damn it , " jamie growled at the top of his lungs . no use in telling him that if he killed sam , then he could never get the human back . he tried to get to
[262/1000]	* * * this seemed the most likely location to be a good one . i made sure i made everything look just right . for once the place was clean , even as i checked and re -
[263/1000]	to meet the other two men in his family . " " he has been dead for six years . how can he have fallen asleep and not woken up ? is there some purpose to this ? "
[264/1000]	" he should have done this to me ! why did n't you just tell me ? it would have saved me a lot of pain . anyway , why did n't you tell me ? " i asked in
[265/1000]	" you said that to them ? about me ? " she shrugged . " yeah , someone else , someone who was supposed to be ... someone you did n't want to be with . and that someone
[266/1000]	" yes , this is all an entirely pointless undertaking , my lord , " the earl said . " we are wasting time . " the earl raised a hand , " we are wasting time . i
[267/1000]	" if someone 's watching the house , or worse yet , making the call . i do n't want that . " " what 's your plan ? " " i 'm going in . " david
[268/1000]	i 'm right when i say , " they 're fine at home . i do n't know why i said that if i were you - " " hey , " kenji says , pushing a stray lock
[269/1000]	" why ? " " it 's the thought that counts . " " i do n't think i like this . " he sighs and drags a hand through his hair . " trust me .
[270/1000]	he turned slightly to look at jane , and then turned at his parents . he reached out and ran his thumb gently over jane 's cheek . she gave him a slight smile . " sweetheart , " he
[271/1000]	or he could come here tonight and ... she shuddered , wondering how he 'd react to meeting her parents . " you want me to let you in ? " brady asked with a smile .
[272/1000]	" i 'd appreciate it if you let them see you for what you truly are . " her jaw firmed and they were both silent . " you sound like my father , " she said finally
[273/1000]	mr. white nodded . " i assume she 'll use it as a book mark . i 'm sure she 'd like to hold her own at the new order . " mr. han ker son grinned like a schoolboy
[274/1000]	" thank you both . " i 'd been wrong . " i guess from the looks of all this " - i touched the large , flat lump on my forehead - " it 'd be just as bad
[275/1000]	" god 's honest truth , " the man said . " the boy 's a true king 's son . he was my brother and he 's my son . you know my son , just as you know

[280/1000]	" i 've already told him , " grace said , " that this is just part of the show . but he 's not interested in the show . " " just look at those blue jeans hanging
[281/1000]	" no . i would n't let anything happen to you . " that made her uneasy . even though they were fighting , he 'd always protected her . " do you love me ? the beast
[282/1000]	" so what you 're saying is , the guy was totally trashed ! " " i meant that it was like he was hit that he could n't talk , and it was n't like his tongue was
[283/1000]	" i think i know . " " so i 'm guessing with the help of our family , we do n't need to worry about our insurance after all . " " yeah . i mean ,
[284/1000]	" you 've been through quite a lot in the last four years . what happened ? if you were n't so stupid , you might 've saved yourself the trouble . " " not really , " he
[285/1000]	" yes ... my lady , " sazed said . " most certainly . " she nodded . she looked at sazed , nodding slightly . " she was speaking of your majesty 's great work as well ,
[286/1000]	" do not worry , his business has been closed , he can not meet you until tomorrow , he can not be with you for a half day or two , when you will be back under your own
[287/1000]	i kept the conversation light , however , for now . for now . i was only slightly interested in all the details of the situation as well as to keep her distracted enough while our eyes stayed locked .
[288/1000]	" is that going to be a problem ? " " no , " she answered . " well , not really . i 'm afraid i 'm gon na need some help . " " what do
[289/1000]	finally we caught up with the rest of the group from what remained of the party and returned to the apartment with the bags from the party ! i took all of our bags into the bedroom and we
[290/1000]	' do n't worry , ' said nanny . ' we 'll go and see the big ship . ' she smiled at magrat and went off . ' in fact , ' she added , ' not a word
[291/1000]	" what is it , babe ? you 're upset . " i shook my head . " i 'm fine , jesse . it 's just that ... you 've been great with me . maybe you can
[292/1000]	" because you want to see if your kind knows what their magic can do . my guess is that the three of you are , like , the only human who knows . do you remember your mother 's
[293/1000]	and then ... shit - you have to do too , she thought . you have to save another life . but the thought did n't seem to matter . the truth was , as he continued to look ,
[294/1000]	but they did n't call . they could n't . he was n't that kind of guy . he was careful . he showed them how to have fun . he looked in the mirror at the way his hair

[297/1000]	for a brief flicker of a moment , i 'd thought he 'd come to take care of me this evening , or at least make love to me . or did he just think to make me into
[298/1000]	but that did n't deter her from asking , " why on earth are you acting this way right now ? " * * * the night that they had left their house , he 'd wanted more
[299/1000]	" i love you ! " she cried . " i love you , too , " i said , trying not to turn into an old man . " you 'll always be my best friend ,
[300/1000]	" in a way , you always did have that , " zane admitted as he let one hand curl around her waist . he could feel the pulse beating there . there were dark red marks on

[302/1000]	" i 'll call in late and request payment for damages . " they followed some of the other workers and a large group of their colleagues to the building where the car was parked . the first driver

[304/1000]	" get in , " i ordered . again , as we are now . i 'm not sure you understand . " " of course i do . " her words were soft , as if she did
[305/1000]	" we should go and stop it , " said chello , impatiently . they picked up their packs and started to walk ahead of chello , who shrugged and followed them . " you 're too excited
[306/1000]	" but i am not your daughter , " dany said , and meant it , " nor have i ever borne a child , and my people have not been that kind to me . " q ar
[307/1000]	" not today , " he told her . " today 's the day i get to save him . " i did n't know where he was going with this . " do you think he needs saved
[308/1000]	" was n't the woman who told you she was happy to see you ? " he asked . " not really . she was so mad at me , i 'll never forget the look on her face
[309/1000]	she laughed at the thought and said , " what were you thinking ? that 's kind of a bad reality television show . " " maybe , " he said . " of course , i could see
[310/1000]	" what did you do to get that scar ? " she asked breathlessly . dante took her hand and kissed it . " i do n't understand , " she said . " what do you mean
[311/1000]	" yes , this is our family home , " the older woman spoke up . " now , everyone , i want to welcome you all back as friends , friends that are going to stay here , but
[312/1000]	her stomach pitched . before she could voice her concerns , rafe stood . rafe lifted his hands and then wrapped his fingers around her arms and pulled her into him . her n * * ples hardened as
[313/1000]	a great wind came up , howling , and snatched open the tent flap . chapter 27 the queen 's court to catelyn stark , the stark family had been nothing more than a distant , separate
[314/1000]	once more , with the same result . the small room began to shake , with a roar of sound that reverberated as the floor shook . i screamed and scrambled for cover behind the chair and the table .
[315/1000]	she turned to face him again , her eyes holding his . " a large family member i 've heard of says there have been rumors of you coming to town . " he laughed . " i can
[316/1000]	" my father will tell father . " " i have seen some dead people . tell me . " " you must tell father . " " i will do my best , the best that
[317/1000]	my shoulders slump . i look down at the empty chair as a hint of relief settles in , but i 'm still reeling over the fact that i managed to throw in the towel with preston . my mother
[318/1000]	he followed her down the narrow aisle to the end . that small space had a ceiling that barely reached the ceiling and a thick red blanket draped over the bottom . " is this your room ? "
[319/1000]	" i 'm just a little embarrassed . i thought you liked me . " " of course i do , " she said softly . " i 've never liked a woman before . " she ran her
[320/1000]	" then show me , " she said to him . she was determined to continue their affair , but her body craved the pleasure this man could provide . " anything you desire . " he leaned down
[321/1000]	" he 's dead , " said the old woman , her voice thin and thin . " do n't be a liar . " " he 's dead , " said james resolutely . " it 's my
[322/1000]	" sorry , miss , this is going over to them , " one of them snapped at me . " mr. kalamack gave me this . " trent ? i stared at them , realizing for the first
[323/1000]	david sat motionless and pale , a look of terror on his face . " what are you going to do ? " he muttered . " it 's not up to me . the only person who has
[324/1000]	" there he is , " she said . out stepped a man she barely recognized as the reverend sanders , wearing a formal gown that seemed to swallow him . he had the look of someone who owned something
[325/1000]	" your thoughts exactly ? " " what can remember about you that i would like to ? " " i remember you like my neck and your lips . " " see . that makes the
[326/1000]	she did n't have to stop . he was n't a moron . " when there 's nothing out in the field that you can see , i fly out . " " no you do n't . you
[327/1000]	" i had n't thought about that , " i said , too relieved to worry about what he was going to do about my mother and what would come of it . " you 've had a lot going
[328/1000]	he shook his head again . " you do n't mind , though , do you ? you 'd like it to be different , would n't you ? " " no , " i answered . it was
[329/1000]	" what 's the matter , then ? there 's got to be someone around here who 's close to him -- " the crowd were forming around her . she lifted her hands , palm out , as
[330/1000]	i was n't expecting this proposal , but i went along with it anyway , a little proud . it would take me a few times to adjust to my new - found confidence , i saw . "
[331/1000]	he stepped forward , stopping a foot from her . his eyes were dark with the deep concern she knew he was experiencing . " do n't be angry , " he said softly . " i 'm not
[332/1000]	i frowned at him . " why has your girlfriend changed your mind ? she 's hot as hell and if someone does n't respect her i ca n't understand why you even care . " " because she
[333/1000]	" that is , of course , because you were on our very side . i know i had to be . i did n't like what father did to you because of it . " he stopped her with
[334/1000]	he grabbed her arms . " get away from me , " she seethed . " i 'm trying to work . " " but you are trying . so let me take care of you . to
[335/1000]	" what ? " " i 'm gon na help my father . do n't worry , i ca n't protect you if you do n't trust me . " " i ca n't trust you , "
[336/1000]	even with the glow of evening behind us , the road was dark from streetlights that flicked on and off in sporadic intervals . at the top of the hill i turned the sharp right , facing east . i
[337/1000]	" where have you been ? " the fact that he did n't immediately acknowledge her presence was an added consolation . " where have we been ? " " on a plane . " the same
[338/1000]	" we lost a few more of your men , " my mother said . " i wish we could have killed them , " said dad . " we knew you were still alive when we captured
[339/1000]	he was only trying to do the only thing he could do : give her what she wanted , give logan what he wanted . he had been scared when they 'd seen this place , but maybe it
[340/1000]	it has been a long day and i am tired . what am i to do in that dungeon ? go back out into the street and sit on my balcony and drink the cold ale and complain about how
[341/1000]	" he 's here ? " i nod . " where ? " " in a cave in the woods . " she shivers . " oh . will you come back ? " "
[342/1000]	" no way in hell are you driving without me ! " " i 'm driving ! i 'm almost there ! " " then help me get in , i 'm stuck . " he climbed
[343/1000]	at school , i was actually grateful for the distraction of my friends . like all days , it was full of people talking about the night 's events and the last few months and the way it went down
[344/1000]	it would not go far . but it surprised her that her parents were not willing to allow it . they could not . " not to frighten you , " she assured them . " but you would
[345/1000]	" does it hurt ? " he asked , bending his head to kiss her chin . " no . it 's very pleasant . " " good . " he pulled away with a grimace and
[346/1000]	" you 're the first , " i told him . " and trust me , i 've done everything all by myself the last , but when you are n't around i think i can walk away . you
[347/1000]	" are you making excuses ? how can you be so calm when you ca n't see something going on inside me - and what the f * * k do you mean , a guy is hanging out with
[348/1000]	" i do n't want you to go , " he growled , his voice edged with determination . " i do n't know why i 'm here . i just saw your plane pass over . and you
[349/1000]	" really ? " " ah ... it 's a bit of a rough spot . the people are always trying to kill us here , " he said with a glance over his shoulder . " but they
[350/1000]	" so he has a mistress ? " he asked . " i know he is a powerful immortal , but what she is for ? what she wants ? is it love ? is she going to let me
[351/1000]	the four of them walked to the hall as daniel pulled out a bottle of champagne . " you two , get over here . " chapter 21 daniel turned , as they sat at a table
[352/1000]	" no , tell me what happened . " " he was on his way out of town , " i quickly answer , avoiding looking at him all of now , though i can feel him watching me
[353/1000]	" what ? oh , oh , " she said , a look of mock confusion crossing her face . " i do n't remember you saying you had a girlfriend , " she added at his expression . "
[354/1000]	" for what ? " he looked down at her . " the last time we were together , you were the only other man i ever wanted to see me nak * d. " she made it sound
[355/1000]	it turned out he 'd been right on more than his usual warning , and he 'd sent his sons off with their own mothers . the next day , he wrote home to tell them of the news
[356/1000]	she glanced back at him , her lips twisting . " that 's why you 've tried to run . " his gaze bored into hers . " i 'm running for my life tonight . " "
[357/1000]	" that a thing ? " " yes . " " but why ? " but then , after all , what were her reasons ? it could not really be an accident . it must have been
[358/1000]	" did you tell her that ? " " not yet , " he says , nodding again . " if not this morning , " i say , " i 'm sure there will be a note
[359/1000]	please , lord ! she told him silently . she was too busy panicking to give up her seat . just as the bus lurched forward , the driver switched to a direc tional signal and headed directly for
[360/1000]	he just shook his head , then reached into one of the sacks and pulled out a little silver pendant from under his shirt . the three of them talked together for quite some time just as the captain
[361/1000]	" your skin feels like heaven , " she whispered , her eyes closed . he nodded , his eyes closed in concentration as he worked , holding her gaze . he brought her down hard over the top
[362/1000]	' i do n't think i understand . ' ' because i do n't get that , pol . my mother is a very devout woman , but she does n't even take religious advice about getting involved with
[363/1000]	" it is my duty to defend your prince to the best of my abilities , " the king said . vin frowned , twisting in her seat , waiting for the others to make their response . ham
[364/1000]	he nodded , and she found herself relaxing . her teeth went a bit too far down the wrong pipe , and in her face , her eyes watered . simon finished handing her the cup . "
[365/1000]	" it does n't matter . at least you do it in bed . so stop worrying about something that should n't be important . " i sat up and felt a cold sweat break out on my skin
[366/1000]	" so do n't we all . " the smile in his voice was just as cocky and sexy as the one in my mouth . god , i could n't ever remember feeling that way about another human being
[367/1000]	' so , miss cohen , ' said miss drapes . ' i 'm going to show it to you now , and if you 've got any objections , ' she said , her voice dropping to a conspiratorial
[368/1000]	" i 'll do n't know , " tom said slowly . " we really ca n't just go charging off to look for him . he might be found doing some of his own work . " "
[369/1000]	" my girl is not safe , " a voice said out of nowhere on the other end of the line , " now can you please stop following me everywhere ? i 'm in a police station ! "
[370/1000]	the voice inside her shouted , " maybe this will help with the nausea . " but her insides remained as taut as a knotted spring . no , it would n't help . it did n't help . it
[371/1000]	" hey , " i tried to sound like i was doing more than talking , " i 'm new to this whole new world where you can just change the future and put it right , okay ? just
[372/1000]	" i see , " she answers and leans back on her elbows . " so the man , the famous mr. emerson , says he married you ? " " yeah , " i say sheepishly . "
[373/1000]	" i 'll make it up to you in the morning , " i promised him . then i grabbed my keys , opened the door , and got out . " see you soon . " " yeah
[374/1000]	" i still ca n't believe you 're one of us , " he says . " how old are you anyway ? wait , wait , wait , who ? who really did this ? you 've never told
[375/1000]	they might live a hundred years , but it was not long . and he 'd have a word with his beloved mate he was fond of . they 'd found the pup . he was a great hunter
[376/1000]	" i need to talk with you . <EOS> then , i 've got ta deal with some of the other officers for the crime scene , and i 've got to talk to him , get some data on
[377/1000]	" i 've been coming down here a lot ? " " me , too . for thanksgiving . we went to turkey every year . " " it does n't smell exactly like turkey , though .
[378/1000]	one day i do that . after leaving my car at mrs. reilly 's , i decide to walk to the zoo . to me , it 's an exciting place ; there 's a beautiful blue sky in the
[379/1000]	" sure . " that was a good change . as a former nfl player , he 'd gotten the shit beat out of him by his parents . had he been to some place like this before ?
[380/1000]	my eyes open to a face that i can only describe as beautiful . her eyes are a pretty shade of hazel and her lips are full and full and - my god . a sob escapes my
[381/1000]	which is right behind ? my head snaps toward the counter as the door swing open again . james steps into view . his hazel eye is narrow , his cheekbones high , and his jaw set . he
[382/1000]	" yes , " he said . " i get that sometimes the most important thing to learn is that there are people in this world , so there are people i care about more than anybody else . "
[383/1000]	" you know us girls , we love to wear make - up . it 's also true , we keep a drawer of eye color that men do n't see here because we do n't want our faces
[384/1000]	in between his pants and his hands she was gripping his ass hard . as they kissed , they made passionate small movements that sent them touching . no longer keeping her wrists behind her back , he gripped her
[385/1000]	she shook her head at him , her eyes pleading for him to stay with her . " no . i have to be with you . " " there 's something wrong with me , honey . "
[386/1000]	i tried not to think of it or wonder if he had been wearing one while in bed . the words , " if you die tonight ... " echoed in my head . i could n't stop thinking about
[387/1000]	" thanks . " she smiles . " it 's alright . you did a great job . " sara replies . " that 's what he gets for being ' good to you ' . " i
[388/1000]	" you 've spent my last few years studying , " ivy says . there 's an edge of hurt in her voice . she reaches down , pulls her hair back , and shakes it to clear her hands
[389/1000]	the crowd gasped and clapped while some of the women cried , some wept , some were crying . those who were unaffected did not return the clap , but merely leaned into one another and sobbed . now that
[390/1000]	we started walking toward the woods as the sun set and the last moon was setting behind a large cloud . i wanted to stay , but so did eva . i did n't know what i wanted to
[391/1000]	" it 's like the universe 's a blender ; none of it has ever been touched . except for those crazy letters to the press . " " is there anything else i could help you with ?
[392/1000]	she was still . he was alive . they were both in the hospital . he 'd seen more death than he wanted to see , but he 'd still survived . now he had to hold the woman
[393/1000]	i laughed with him , squeezing his shoulder . " it 's not your fault . " " you did a fantastic job this time . " " you do n't have to tell me what i did
[394/1000]	she nodded and pointed to a spot on the map . " this is the location of your house . " " it looks like a good place to start , " i agreed . " but where we
[395/1000]	" why not ? " ethan asked , raising a brow . " because one of those ' he was a vampire . ' he also said that your mom and sister were ' my ' grand daughters .
[396/1000]	the entire crowd was in the air now . as they approached the center court , the men threw a net and cheered . one of the women reached under the net and grabbed a bag of chips . the
[397/1000]	" your best friend , " he replied , before sighing in frustration . " i already gave her away . " " but , she thought she was marrying you . " he could get to them with
[398/1000]	the guy from the car looked at us curiously . he must have seen the exchange between mom and me , and they both flashed me a grin . " hey , that was the thing with two of
[399/1000]	she laughed again and pulled his lips down to hers , her teeth nipping at his lower lip . " because you love me , do n't you ? " " i love you , " he said right
[400/1000]	" yeah . . . look at those , " pete says , gesturing to the tv mounted above the tv . " they 're on national alone . i guess that 's what you 'll call it , then
[401/1000]	" would that be the same people from your own family at your age ? " " yes , but it does n't count if we do n't live under their radar . in any case , there 's
[402/1000]	' he did . it 's like being able to hear the sound of his own voice with a voice that tells you he knows nothing but you . ' ' it 's not like that ! '
[403/1000]	his hand shook as he took it . " i 'm sorry , honey , " he said , and took another sip of brandy . when he was finished , he set the glass down on a nearby table
[404/1000]	" please do n't . " he shook his head and tried to sound repentant . " of course ' sc use me , i did not mean for you to get your hopes up . " and then he
[405/1000]	" so , do we need a doctor ? " caleb asked . " because i 've heard they could do emergency room stuff . " caleb shook his head seriously . " no , this means that we
[406/1000]	and yet he had a feeling that one day she would forget about her past . instead of going back to his house , he parked his car in front of hers . chapter three " this
[407/1000]	" a few things . " i smiled sweetly and waited for her to notice . " but most of all , a couple things . " " like ? " " uh - uh . we 'll
[408/1000]	" and we 're trying to put them back , " frank said . a few minutes later , the three men stood at the edge of the woods to watch the procession with the horses tethered behind it
[409/1000]	" fuck . " he kissed me on the forehead and then stood , tossing me his shirt . " come on . " he looked at me briefly , hands behind his back , shaking his head .
[410/1000]	i was just about to turn my head back to look at the window when i heard a knock on the door . i 'd been a little startled by it , probably because it was from evan .
[411/1000]	he looks across the bay at the ship i am currently in search of . " he will need to be cut out of it , and eventually . " " i like looking for weapons . "
[412/1000]	" be careful with those knives , " will said . " they do n't let you run around like he 's a wolf when he 's under his spell . they wo n't let him live if he 's
[413/1000]	she sighed , running her fingers through her hair . " so , are you going to be okay alone ? " she asked . " if you think you 'll continue to question me , we need
[414/1000]	i had to get out of here . i ran out the door and onto the sidewalk , out into the early - morning cool . we could see the roof of the factory and the tall buildings ,
[415/1000]	chapter 11 they had their little fling three days ago , so it was easy enough to ignore me . the longer i was around , the more i liked her . i could control my rages and urges
[416/1000]	" we did n't have enough supplies to stop many of them after they were on the run . " then thomas leaned against the bench cushions . " your mother and i could n't stop them . what
[417/1000]	" i 'm serious , " i insisted . " you 're like my brother . you do n't talk about anything for almost three years and you always look like you can cut a pretty piece off your finger
[418/1000]	" it 's a little early in the day for a hot shower . let 's get you cleaned up before your body 's too tired to carry on a conversation . " " sounds good . you 're
[419/1000]	" what is that like ? " he asked in a low voice . and he was n't asking me to leave because he was worried about me . which was kind of endearing . " it 's pretty
[420/1000]	" we have to get across . " " i figured it would take us a while . i do n't think we 'll even have the guts to take the ferry . " " i 'm not
[421/1000]	" then you have me . " he pulled his top hat off and then tossed it on the coffee table , his hands still pushing at his hair . " then we 'll have more children than we
[422/1000]	i grabbed her hand . " then you 're a lucky bitch . " her smile remained as smug as usual . " the best . " * * * * * * * three hours later
[423/1000]	i started to relax . he did n't look like he was going to attack again - so i got down on my knees , which was no easy task and was easier to lift than i 'd imagined to
[424/1000]	" i might 've missed it , " i whispered . " did you really ? " " yes , i saw it . that was my dad next door , " i said , smiling .
[425/1000]	" yeah , that 'd be great ... thanks . " the receptionist gave them a quick glance , but would n't look at them directly . they 'd never been quite so obvious as to the reason for
[426/1000]	" is n't anyone getting sick ? " " why are they taking these things ? " " you were asleep so i thought we should tell you , " said heather . " my boyfriend ?
[427/1000]	slowly , i began to regain the feeling of belonging and family again . i started thinking of the children i had and how they would have raised me . of my mother working under me . how i could
[428/1000]	the waitress delivered her next round of drinks . both men got some ice cubes , and she smiled cheerily . while she poured the drinks , she spoke to jeremy and rachel over the loud music . "
[429/1000]	her soft voice took on a pleading quality . " maybe . but i 've been told that the sooner you can heal , the sooner i can save you . could you tell me that your mother 's
[430/1000]	" i can . " no idea who my father 's been referring to all the time . " you let her in ? " " yeah . " " why did n't you invite her in
[431/1000]	that man is gone . i 'm sure now that he will never be found . i will never see my mother again . chapter 49 the day lasts many more days , and while i prepare for
[432/1000]	" it was never meant in a way that i thought could be considered good , " i said quickly , trying to lighten the mood . " i just wanted to feel good . i wanted to feel alive
[433/1000]	" you do n't need to be saying all that . it 's not hard to find out what you want without being forced to be nice . " " you 're right , " she said quietly ,
[434/1000]	" ah . i will . we must talk , then . " " i do n't think that 's going to happen , " she said , though he sensed she was holding her breath . she leaned
[435/1000]	he nodded and took a drink from the bottle . when he set the glass down on the table , he said , " are you telling me that you do n't remember ? " she shook her
[436/1000]	" what happened to the house ? " i asked . " the realtor showed up and moved it back into a siding job , " jackson said . " oh , " i said in a small
[437/1000]	it was the first time since they 'd gotten home that he actually thought about things other than the stuff he was going to do with the shop later . " i 'm thinking a little of the shop
[438/1000]	his cheeks were red from the sunlight . " i 'm not talking . " he kept his eyes on the road . " i 'm talking about you being here on my vacation . i brought you here because
[439/1000]	" is he going to be okay ? " she murmured . she 'd asked him if he 'd be okay , and she 'd been able to tell from his tone that he was so tired that he needed
[440/1000]	" well , i guess i can sleep off the hangover . that would be nice . thanks for leaving me some money . " he smiles before pulling the car up to the curb . " my pleasure
[441/1000]	ryan closed his eyes . the world was quiet as he watched the world take shape . now that it had quieted , his senses started to register the sound of the world . voices . every few moments ,
[442/1000]	" he could be dead . " " you 've thought about that . " the image of her father 's body hit me hard for a second and i did n't respond . i thought back to
[443/1000]	" no , you just sit here and eat , " she said , patting my hand and chuckling softly as she saw me staring at her hands . what is her deal ... ? the rest of
[444/1000]	" no . " jack paused for a moment . " i 'm not sure i want to say anything . " " yeah ? " her heart clenched at the thought . jack was about to find out
[445/1000]	" tell me you did n't hear that . " " i heard it loud and clear , " she said , sitting forward . " i 'm going to sue you . " " you 're gon
[446/1000]	" what ? " " i spoke with the president on the same business . " " he 's a friend , the best part of being president . he helped me save the country from a life
[447/1000]	" you sound so much like mary june that when i say ' my grandmother ' it surprises me . " she giggles again . " well , i would have thought mary june is an idiot . you
[448/1000]	" we 'll see . " chapter 18 an easy - to - read male voice asked , " can i help you ? " holly glanced up , and saw her stalker , luke o' rourke
[449/1000]	" and you will be . good - bye , then . " " thank you , " she said , and i knew that she meant it . would be . " happy birthday . " a
[450/1000]	" so take to your next show , " she said . then he kissed her again , long , hot , slow kisses , giving her a preview of how much he needed her . the way she
[451/1000]	at least there was n't anything big and bulky in this area . " the last time i checked , there was more than one way to get to the site . " " no , " he said
[452/1000]	" is it you ? " " who else could it be ? " " he said - " " i know , you did what you could , she said . i 'm not dead yet .
[453/1000]	" it 's not that bad , " evan says , trying to maintain an even tone , but he 's as nervous as i am . " i 'm sure it would be much worse if you did
[454/1000]	" i am . " " oh ? " " come get away from him . " " where ? " " give him this . " " what 's it for ? "
[455/1000]	" he was going to have to finish with me once he was done , either by tearing out my throat or getting himself some of that poison . " jamie 's eyes were bleak , but his mouth was
[456/1000]	" i 've already been over through the details , " she said . " does it leave you feeling any different by the end ? " " well " - she straightened into a huff - "
[457/1000]	" i guess we should get out of here , " i said . i was starting to get my bearings back . " yeah . well , like you said , you all have your work cut out
[458/1000]	" she 's right . i suppose some people have a problem with that . " " it 's to save their souls . i ca n't hate on a woman . that 's just being myself . "
[459/1000]	the general 's gaze bounced between them with that single expression of confusion . " that did n't get you off the hook . " but she was n't so sure what he was implying . " so what
[460/1000]	" okay . i 'll call you back . " " hey . " i heard him clear his throat several times before he finally called . " hey . " i smiled at him , rubbing my
[461/1000]	he was , because as her eyes started to close , he got so close she could smell him . his cologne was familiar . the man was still alive . " you 're going to kill me ,
[462/1000]	" the word of god ? well , that would also explain your being in a black - collar cell for the past two days . one moment of calm and quiet , and you are the man i love
[463/1000]	" you can do this , mom . " " i do n't know if you can . " " mom , it 's over . " " oh , yes it is . " she grabbed
[464/1000]	the next day , the two sisters - in - law and two children - had returned to the house just as the sun was setting . the women spent a couple of quiet hours at the breakfast room table
[465/1000]	" you have to stay here , " said george . " you 've got to stick out your butt . " george took another swig of beer . * * * " where have you been
[466/1000]	' you 're not going to die , that 's obvious , ' his father warned . ' well do i have to make you ? i could let you go with one bullet for all i care , but
[467/1000]	" oh , no , you do n't . none of that is going to happen . no part of that is going to happen . there will never be a marriage and a family . no real marriage .
[468/1000]	" why are we here ? " " as i recall , it was n't a choice . it was a condition of our arrangement . we agreed out of our sick little minds to discuss the threat ,
[469/1000]	" i told you , i 'm not the type who knows how long to wait , " chase said , trying to cover up his rising frustration . " i 'll be back . " chase hurried toward
[470/1000]	do n't call me mother , you bastard ! i 'm your property ! " i screamed at him . oh , the rage in my voice , the rage that i could feel creeping up the inside of my
[471/1000]	he turned the lock and then reached right for the door handle , but for his hand it was already shaking . " i 'll get over it , " alex promised him , hoping she 'd be successful
[472/1000]	" hello , " i offer again , as if the smile that 's on my face is n't as fake as it feels . " i thought you might have heard from me , " he says when
[473/1000]	i had no idea what he meant by that . i was a novice and had n't even met him . i was n't totally sure if i could live with myself for even talking to him again .
[474/1000]	" do n't have the nerve , " said granny . " you try me , you 'll wake someone up . besides , it is n't real . i 'm not going to take up , and if i
[475/1000]	" what 's happened ? " " there was a fire , someone ... it 's an inferno down on a lake ... a black funnel of smoke ... it was down there , when i woke up .
[476/1000]	" how 's this for understanding ? " he stood up and leaned toward her , capturing her hands , lifting them up over her head . her eyes dropped to his lips , then his groin . " you
[477/1000]	' there 's the truth . ' he kept talking . ' there 's the truth . ' it was going to be you with me . ' but it was going to be us together
[478/1000]	" the little boy 's name , " he said , then blinked . " what 's the matter ? " bonnie asked . he was looking through the window , down the street , at a young man and
[479/1000]	" you know that the girl was a vampire , and that she had a lot of experience in protecting those she cared for . i 've been keeping her safe , from you . " it will be
[480/1000]	" you 're so good - looking , babe , you should 've been a model . " he turns us around in another circle , until we find a couple of people at the bar . " yeah
[481/1000]	the man shrugged , a thin line of perspiration covering his forehead and cheeks . he wiped his hand on his pants . then he picked up the cell phone and scrolled fast . " it 's been a while
[482/1000]	she let out an overly loud snort . " come on , let 's go . " " okay , " he said quickly , glancing down at her . " say do n't do that again . "
[483/1000]	" i guess you could say i 'm an artist , " he admitted . " i just can not paint . " she frowned in confusion . " that 's too bad , i was hoping you could
[484/1000]	" i have seen what you can do . you can turn them on with your mind , " the man said . " they did n't have a choice , did they ? " " and how do
[485/1000]	" then get her <EOS> get me , " i guess . " she 's gone . we talk about the party . everything . we share this . i 'm not saying anything all the time .
[486/1000]	" good , " he said . " do n't forget to call , too . " " oh , i wo n't . " what else was he going to do ? check on her and tell her
[487/1000]	' who , mr lipwig ? ' said cheery . ' i can smell it . ' ' oh . me , ' said moist . ' i hope it 's not about stamps , by any chance .
[488/1000]	" what 's up ? " i asked . she sat upright . " where the heck have you been ? " i explained that i was sick and went - probably off the grid - with a
[489/1000]	" the girl is a bit young to wear such clothes , of course , " said henry . he felt the old familiar pang of guilt . " you should have told me she was pretty . so lovely
[490/1000]	" my husband would have been happier if it had been a girl , " my mother admitted , glancing over at me . i was horrified . it was too bad she had to go through all the
[491/1000]	" and she 's been so good to me . " " there you go . " " but even after all these years , i 'm starting to think i just have n't taken enough of her
[492/1000]	" do n't talk like that . " " your heart is strong enough to fight , emma . it will prevail through your pain . " " i do n't need to see this , to feel
[493/1000]	" see if they get the hint , " said jane , " and i 'll get some letters to drop off to me . " * * * it was about eight in the evening when they reached
[494/1000]	" yeah , about the problem are we 'll have a lot more time before we just go out and shoot some hoops . " " i 'm not sure that 's a good idea . " "
[495/1000]	" what ? " " i was just asking if you can find information on these zombies . " " well , i tried to talk to their father a few minutes ago . he wo n't tell
[496/1000]	" i do n't know where you got the idea that the girl was a girl ... " " um , i guess there are a few people who believe that she was a girl . . . .
[497/1000]	" we have to change , " i said . " it will make people happier . they 'll know we 're having a baby . " he smiled . " yeah , it will . we 'll make
[498/1000]	but that was that . no more . nothing . " you ready to fight for your position ? " she asked at last . no way . " what am i going to do ? "
[499/1000]	his wife made an odd screeching sound between gasps as if the very air was being sucked from her lungs . and yet she did n't cry . she merely gazed up at him sweetly as his body tightened
[500/1000]	i nodded and held her hands when she broke the emotional hold . " yes , " i said , but it was my head that was on a swivel , my cheek against her chest as her heart raced
[501/1000]	i would never stay with a man like him . i did n't even know what i was saying , except that i was afraid . you had to feel that way around him until he said he wanted you
[502/1000]	" very well . i was n't doing my job to get back to the job , " he paused , and when he spoke again , he seemed more like himself than he had in months . " but
[503/1000]	in the first half of the fourth day we came to a lake , my toes touching the black sandy shore . we stared at the crystal clear water . i was trying to figure out why henri had gotten
[504/1000]	" we need to talk . " his posture changed under that hard expression and i wanted to reassure him , but i stayed quiet . " we do n't have any answers for you , but we do
[505/1000]	they 'll take care of the rest . " his mouth curved into an arrogant smile . " there were some pretty bad guys and the authorities are putting men on their payroll . " okay , he
[506/1000]	the air around the tree , when that wood touched him was a deep , dark , heady shade , and he sensed it as it rose around him , whispering . his eyes blinked open and he saw that
[507/1000]	" well put . if your theory is correct , there 's no hope for this place ever being found ! " " it 's still an option . " " well , we will have to act
[508/1000]	" and you seem to be in an excellent mood , " i say , trying to sound sarcastic since i just felt like a broken record . " i have to pick up a new girl , "
[509/1000]	he was like a small , tall mountain , leaning on tiny branches . the branches were thinner here , which meant we would n't be crawling beneath a bed of needles right now . " who else there
[510/1000]	" i guess . i do n't know what could be more shocking . " " you have n't seen a blood mark , " i suggested . robin shrugged , and his shoulders tensed . i saw
[511/1000]	his eyes were focused straight ahead as i walked him back to his car . once my backpack was on the backseat , i gave him the hand , and he helped me inside , starting up the car .
[512/1000]	a dark - haired girl is sitting on that ledge , watching us . a girl she hates . the dark - haired girl stands , un hurriedly walking out of the car . she has a few
[513/1000]	" the same to me , " he said . " i 'm pretty drunk . " she smiled . " no doubt . " " hey , you do n't want to be alone with me for
[514/1000]	it 's the last thing i need - some kid pointing a camera at us , and the photographer following us everywhere . that 's a problem here . but even as i 'm about to do something i
[515/1000]	" would that help anything ? " " of course it would . " i had to think about it for a moment . " how does the human mind absorb so much pain ? is there a
[516/1000]	" what 's wrong , ma ? " " the phone rang and no one is answering . " " i left the house to go and look for her . i know if i just call them
[517/1000]	' i was just imagining the possibility of me accidentally killing you , of him stabbing you and draining you dry . as soon as i realised what he was doing i dropped my knife in shock . i was
[518/1000]	" now , " he said , smiling up at me , " we 're going to be a bit late to dinner , because i 'm taking you back to the penthouse . " i frowned . "
[519/1000]	" yes , " we say . " how long have i known ? " " you 've known all of us since we were kids , " i say . " you do n't think it
[520/1000]	" okay , i 'm gon na be there within the hour , " he said . i leaned in , kissing the top of his head . it 's nice when a guy did something nice for me
[521/1000]	it did n't happen like that . " what did he say ? " she shrugged . " if i told him ... " the way she rubbed her aching temples and shut her eyes told me she
[522/1000]	in their cell , they shared the same cell , the same cell that might hold ian 's uncle , but had changed . " let 's do it while we 're still low on blood . "
[523/1000]	the way he spoke , it was a little creepy . " you 're right . after all , i 'm probably going to have to come up with as many ideas as i can on a scale of one
[524/1000]	" it 's not so easy . i mean , i 'm in a mood . it 's hot , and you 're so beautiful . " his eyes are on the center of my chest . i feel as
[525/1000]	what the ? " " you know what i mean , girl , " mrs. mercer said . " they still would n't bring all your family guests . " emma could n't seem to think of a
[526/1000]	he looked right at me and smiled . although the smile did n't touch his face , it was still the same gorgeous smile . that smile was n't all mine , not anymore . a memory surfaced and i
[527/1000]	" you love me ? " " of course i do , but ... " " ' but ? ' " his laugh is soft above me . " ' but ' is such an obvious word
[528/1000]	" just so you know it 's not just you , " she said with a smile . " that 's the problem . i do n't know . my priorities tend to be skewed . " "
[529/1000]	that must be a good explanation . someone went past us on the path , heading out through the forest . the path was a straight one - <EOS> the ground , but at times , in summer when
[530/1000]	" you really do n't have to worry about him , " her voice cracks on the last word . if i 'd fallen apart all over again that night , it 's what she 'll do to make sure
[531/1000]	" actually , " he said with a smirk as he moved between my legs , " i did think we could have a nice long talk and then - " he kissed my lips gently and then he moved
[532/1000]	" are you sure ? " he asked her quietly . " yes , " she responded . " i was going to tell you anyway . " she paused to catch her breath before saying , " she
[533/1000]	" it 's a small matter , " she said with a firm statement . " i 'm not really interested . " " why not ? " " because i promised you . " " promise
[534/1000]	i was right , she did have a good heart . so , if we had n't met before , when we 'd kissed at the restaurant and i 'd noticed her and the girl , what would she have
[535/1000]	" i need a drink . " " i said no - you 're coming with me . " she let out another shout but could n't move , could n't force her body enough to resist him
[536/1000]	" you can save it , " he continued , his back to her , leaning into the dresser . " do me a favor , and then i 'll leave you alone for a week . " "
[537/1000]	that gave him pause . he 'd thought she was already gone . of course , he had n't expected her to leave , let alone come back ... except to kiss him and get him killed that night .
[538/1000]	" me . " " what ? " he smiles a little as she blinks a quick and obvious tear . " you 're a wonderful friend . " i know she said that , and i
[539/1000]	" there 's not . " he reached for the door and found it locked . she pulled at the handle . a whoosh of heat shot past him , pushing the door open wide enough for him
[540/1000]	" is it safe ? " " oh , yeah . just get to your work assignment , you 'll be back before breakfast . " " all right , sir . i will . " he
[541/1000]	she was taken aback by the harshness of his tone . " i 'm sorry , " she insisted , and took a step toward him . " i should n't have asked you if i could help .
[542/1000]	i had a feeling everyone would get that idea and so the more worried i was about what he was going to do to me in his vehicle , the more i turned my nose up at the idea of
[543/1000]	she waited . " just ask . " " i want to know if that 's a legal question . " " oh , " she said again . " it 's a standard question , a legal
[544/1000]	" how much have we lost ? " " half our shares of the company now . " " what ? " he roared again . " we lost twenty percent of our capital and some of our
[545/1000]	' that wo n't work ! ' i said , ' we 're going to attract lots of unwanted attention ! ' ' i 'll go into town , ' the dwarf offered , reluctantly . ' get you
[546/1000]	the man shook her hand . " i 'd like you to meet my dad , " grace said . she sounded as if she were about to cry . " he 's very upset right now , but
[547/1000]	" come off it . that was n't just an attack . i was watching it from a great distance . i went out in the dark and saw a dragon . it was beautiful ! " " oh
[548/1000]	" i mean - i know that she is a talented artist but now that she is here i can tell it is amazing . oh , her mind is so focused and good , but she does n't listen
[549/1000]	<EOS> " you did care , " i whispered . " maybe you were always going to let me make love to you , but this time it 's important to me . " he kissed the corner of
[550/1000]	i nodded . " i wish i could do more , but the more i wait , everything will get so complicated . i just do n't know if it will go where we normally want it to . "
[551/1000]	" what do you think , dr. warthrop ? " " it fits with the other , " replied the doctor . " to whom - if the other is not infected with the disease , and we can
[552/1000]	" then let us move faster . " by the time the sun had risen high enough to cover nearly the entire horizon , they were all over the horizon for the final crossing . the boat had brought
[553/1000]	" that does n't take , " the vampire complained . " i just ordered a cocktail , remember ? " " i did n't need two glasses is all . " the bartender slid a glass over the
[554/1000]	there was a general silence and it was not only more silence but a terrible silence all around as the creatures stared out at the far green wall and then at each other . from that moment upon they were
[555/1000]	i swallowed the sour lump in my throat . did i really want to know ? i had no chance to ask him , the elevator doors opened and my stomach churned . " hello , "
[556/1000]	" right , but they usually go for more than they stand for , " he said , looking at the front door now . " how are they going to clean up all this mess if there 's no
[557/1000]	" i know , " i replied instantly . " i 'll be looking for you , baby . " " okay , " i agreed on a whisper . i tipped my head back to give him
[558/1000]	" the other girl , alice , is n't he in love with you ? " " no ! " " so are you really going to keep playing ? " " of course ! how else
[559/1000]	" at a time like this ? " " with both hands again ? yes . " he was n't a man who enjoyed repeating himself , but at the moment all that mattered to him was the
[560/1000]	" is this what you wanted ? " he snapped at her , then stalked up to meet her for a kiss . he kissed her deeply , their tongues tangling . sparks flew between them , and heat blossomed
[561/1000]	he bent and kissed the end of her nose . " what am i going to do with you ? " " with me ? " he chuckled and rolled . he put her to her back and
[562/1000]	she smiled , her expression friendly as he reached a hand through the doorway . the door slammed shut with a deafening crunch . jason opened the door , glanced over his shoulder , noticed holly behind him
[563/1000]	she took a glance at the clock on the wall , seeing that it was after ten . " are you sure you did n't know who he was ? " lily shook her head . " there
[564/1000]	" you sound like you 're angry . " i smiled . " i am . but i 'm trying to get over it . if you had never taken me to college , we would n't be in
[565/1000]	' will you do with all of this knowledge ? ' ' i 'm learning something : i ca n't read minds now ; but i can tell my future , see . i can change who i am
[566/1000]	" the two of us , huh ? how 's that going for you ? " " it 's fine , " she said , trying to smile . " he tried to kill me and i saved him
[567/1000]	from the corner of my eye i saw a flash of light . he must have hit something at the back of the shop , because i heard the blast of a gun . " look ahead , "
[568/1000]	" it 's not the same , " she assured him . " that i 've never seen . " " it 's not . " now that she 'd shared what had happened earlier , her
[569/1000]	" i 'm scared , " she says . i can hear the smile but she does n't say anything else as the car starts to move . i 'm sitting next to my mom and she 's quietly
[570/1000]	a low , almost sexual purr comes from her until i sink a knee between us , my hips grinding against her . " you 're not a virgin . " " shit no , " she says with
[571/1000]	" i 'm a grown man and i can take care of himself . he 's doing his own thing ; besides , my parents will vouch for me . " " your parents were dead , " she
[572/1000]	his expression turns grim . " why ? " " why what ? " " why did you kiss him , karissa ? " i sigh as i watch him . finally , it does hit me
[573/1000]	" when ? when would we see her again ? " " we 'll see of her tomorrow , " he answered calmly . " get some sleep . " " but why now ? " "
[574/1000]	" oh ! i forgot to tell you . we had a bet going on who could call you better . " " aw , i 'm out , " i told her , not really feeling it one
[575/1000]	" no , i did n't ! " his eyes bore into me , burning . i looked at his chest , and the jagged scar . the scar he 'd received at his tender age . it was
[576/1000]	his words caused me to suck in a sharp breath as he flipped me over into the bedroom . he was about to f * * k me out of my mind . i would have been out of
[577/1000]	' you did ask me to promise you no more . to stay away from him , ' she admitted . ' why do n't you understand that ? you 're the reason i 'm here . ' '
[578/1000]	this question , a serious one of course , had been weighing on his mind lately , but he had refused to seek it out because it made him think and he wanted it to be true . of course
[579/1000]	" i do n't think you 'll be doing them if you 're living there by yourself . " " well , i do use to live there , " he said . " and i 'm not going
[580/1000]	" yes , " i sighed . " but why ? " i looked at jacob . i did not want him to say that i 'd helped her for him . but even if i did ,
[581/1000]	his mother made a sound of distress at the man 's choice . " do you really want to know ? " he demanded . " no , i must know . " " i said i 'd
[582/1000]	" yes , but remember as you ride through me you are wearing those beautiful silks of yours . " his hand swept across my stomach and then traced down to cup my hip . his long fingers slid
[583/1000]	" but you said it killed the baby . " that is why she was wearing the diamond necklace , not having time to change her mind when he asked her about it . she wanted to argue that
[584/1000]	they worked their way past the security crowd and took a final ten feet before reaching the exit . most of the guys were still doing drills in the front , but a few guys were still working through the
[585/1000]	" how did you know ? " " your face was so pale and you did n't even cry or smile - do n't you remember that ? " " no , " i whispered , my whole
[586/1000]	i grabbed the phone and dialed his number . the number rang numerous times before i heard that he did n't pick up . " grant ? " " no , sweetheart , it 's me . yes
[587/1000]	still in a daze , i made my way down into the basement in search for the stairs . once downstairs , i found my way to the center of the structure to find my way downstairs through a maze
[588/1000]	" i 'll be right back . " i walk to the office and sit at my desk while i wait for emily to finish . after thirty minutes , i rush out to grab my keys and purse
[589/1000]	she stepped forward . " what is the matter with you ? you used to be the good guys , the ones i could count on and did n't let anyone else get hurt . you were the great hero
[590/1000]	i was going to lie and leave it the way it was - with no way to argue against what he was offering . why would i want to spend my whole life being dependent on something that was n't
[591/1000]	" it would seem so , " i said , nodding glumly as i slid into the passenger seat . " you just forgot , " he said , his good humor vanishing . " i have some work
[592/1000]	" i 'm not the one you want tonight , " i said , and his expression grew harder . i held up my hands . " okay . yeah , he 's kinda cute . " " just
[593/1000]	he 's sitting right next to me , so i reach over and squeeze his hand . " hey , i 'm the third wheel in the whole thing so i do n't feel too lonely . besides , i
[594/1000]	her arms banded around his firm shoulders , her body pressing to his and kissing him deeply again . chapter 9 matt slid his arms around her waist and brought her against him . he ached to climb
[595/1000]	" i 'll stay with you , " alex said in a stronger voice . " like you 'd say yes if i did n't ? let me talk to him . " alex just grimaced when he
[596/1000]	" please , do n't do this . " he frowned . " do what ? stand by while someone you care about dies because of you ? " he growled . " do something to make up for
[597/1000]	" it 's fine . no one will tell you what you are seeing , " she said . " yes , i can see . she wants me to study the pictures for her . " "
[598/1000]	" she 'll give you another chance . i promise . " his gentle voice is kind . his words do n't make me feel any better , and i want this to help him , but they leave me
[599/1000]	" you may not have heard my statement against the case , " she says . " instead , you will get another chance like the one before . you will talk to your client . she will talk to
[600/1000]	" you too , kiddo ! " a loud male voice shouted from above . the plane climbed quickly . the pilot and copilot turned to find a small gray form climbing three - foot - high stairs
[601/1000]	" what i do n't understand do n't matter boy , " the man sneered , " here 's to war . i give you the choice of it . you either give up this job right now and find
[602/1000]	the other guy gave an odd chuckle and said , " it 's not my fault . just because you want something more than sex does n't mean it 's okay . i 'm not interested . " then ,
[603/1000]	" it 's like everything else has gone and you had to pretend to be someone you 're not , " i said , turning her toward me . " i knew all about it . we knew that your
[604/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " he said . " i must have been mistaken . you do n't seem to be the type who would have been so aggressive . " " i 'm sorry , " i
[605/1000]	" so what does that mean ? " i ask with nervous voice . he takes off for the house , just as i 'm stepping out of the car . " you wanted to explain . you
[606/1000]	no , i was glad he found him at that very moment . i stood and looked from my father , to my brother , to the other guy . he was smiling at the end and was even
[607/1000]	i smiled at her , knowing an innocent smile when i saw one a day . " i think we should do the ice - skating without anyone knowing , " she joked back . she pointed her finger
[608/1000]	she glanced over at the clock . almost one . " they 're talking , are n't they ? the old man with the tape recorder . " colin shook his head . " you got ta be
[609/1000]	" like , what if he likes it ? " " he ca n't afford the tuition . he 's afraid people will think we 're taking advantage of the state . " " you 're taking advantage
[610/1000]	and then another . some with white light around them . like fireflies . what 's up with that ? the sun must be low in the sky now . he turns away . maybe he should just get
[611/1000]	" all of this just makes sense now ... because ... " " because the whole thing has to do with rachel . " james saw the hurt in her eyes , and it scared him .
[612/1000]	" i 'm glad you did n't let him take you home , ma'am . i knew better . " " can you put me down , sam ? " i ask . " yes , ma'am .
[613/1000]	" oh please , sir . i 'm perfectly fine , " she protested , but he placed a finger on her lips , silencing her . he stepped back and took a deep breath . " let
[614/1000]	who were they ? i glanced up at the ceiling . it was a thick black ceiling ; that was good . the only thing that kept the sky in place was the black roof . i heard the
[615/1000]	" oh , you 're going to marry and spoil me rotten . " eve tried to laugh it off . " you 're one to talk . i 'm all you 've got . " " i love
[616/1000]	" yes , the money they have right before the trial is what is allowed . " " well , do n't underestimate them . with what they have done , these people will likely lose custody of their
[617/1000]	" what ? " if the car 's owner were going to be on an emergency vacation , who better than the city of pittsburgh to deliver him to the people he had come to know well ?
[618/1000]	the king 's eyes narrowed . " i do not want anyone leaving this chamber . " " i am tired of being here , your majesty . " gaultier nodded , placing his hands on his hips .
[619/1000]	" i 'll wait outside with the other security women until you 're ready , " he said , going to the door . " do n't you dare ? " she asked . " i 'm going
[620/1000]	" you wanted to talk about it ? " i asked . i noticed they were still standing near the wall . " is that what we 're going to do ? " the boy asked . "
[621/1000]	why ? how the hell would i have the strength to resist a kiss when being inside one always made me feel like shit ? " is that the first time you 've been in at three flags
[622/1000]	" i 'm not letting you get away with anything . " she ignored his declaration and started thinking hard . he did have her phone . even if they tried to break up , there was no way
[623/1000]	" me too . we 've almost beaten them , and i still do n't know how . i think there are more creatures out there anyway but there must be more of them ... maybe they 're getting ready
[624/1000]	as if i were n't there and in a room i 'd never left my body because the beast inside me was there , ready to take me over . and as i watched , i felt it , not
[625/1000]	" we 'd better get on the ground , " i said , but my voice was just as low now that we were finally alone . i tried to take to the air . i was too far away
[626/1000]	" of course not , " i said . the memory of being in my car and with gavin again surged through me . " we did n't do it like that . " " why not ? "
[627/1000]	he had come to his senses . * " where are you going ? " she was not interested in a meal anymore , and she could feel the hunger pangs returning in force . how could it
[628/1000]	i think the guys got it . i 've never known any of them to do so . i never realized that was n't being done until i hit the bar , but i 'd seen it , heard it
[629/1000]	" you mean this is real ? " sarah asks . " i could see him in my dreams , but not him in mine ? " " you saw him , sure . " " but not in my
[630/1000]	" i do n't think it will be very nice , " he said , and i knew he was n't trying to make it pleasant . it was a fact that ethan had to work for it - he
[631/1000]	" it fits , they 're all similar - all i need to do is to figure out the one in the middle . " " and that is why we should use your computer and leave the rest
[632/1000]	" we were in a bar in london , " he said without preamble . then not sure if she had heard him , he added , " in a club . " lily flushed . " i ...
[633/1000]	" that 's not what it was meant to be . you do n't go along with everything i tell you to do . " " what 's the rush ? the world could come and take me with
[634/1000]	' yes ? ' ' we are trying to locate a lost painting of a strange looking girl . she seems to have disappeared into thin air but she had a couple of paintings with her just a few
[635/1000]	' yes , he is , ' said nutt . ' we will teach you how to do this once you have begun . ' and nutt said : ' oh , this is so nice of you to
[636/1000]	i nod , but i 'm scared to say anything . if this gets out - whether i have even a decent chance of acqu itting this - i 'll be branded a liar . " no , you
[637/1000]	a couple days ? " i asked . " as much as we can survive the night , " he agreed . " where to ? " " no telling anywhere in particular . " i
[638/1000]	" what ? " his face was suddenly lit up . so much joy , so much happiness , that he suddenly looked more like a boy than the man he was . " you 're pregnant ? "
[639/1000]	" because he 's a good man , " john said . " he 's a good friend . everything i 've done for you , i 've done to protect you . do n't listen to yourself . you
[640/1000]	" but he 's in trouble with the city council . they think he 's going to try and turn the government around on national television . " " i hope you 're right , " i said .
[641/1000]	he was back , standing outside our door , now wearing a pair of sweatpants and no underwear . i could see the outline of his cock , still wet . he was waiting for me , his eyes on
[642/1000]	" what have you been telling your family ? " " nothing . only the truth . how they need to know the truth . " " i can see why you may not feel comfortable divul ging
[643/1000]	after a moment his eyes locked onto mine . " the key to my world is in here . your safety , my life 's salvation , are in here . " my head tilted to the side at
[644/1000]	" we should save the baby 's life , " said the girl , " at least be able to give it something to believe in . " " i feel very strongly that we should help , "
[645/1000]	" he 's doing it like he 's doing it to you , " she argued . " how do you know about that ? " " i heard about a million girls who were into this guy
[646/1000]	he left in the same manner he had approached . for one thing , all the doors on the street were locked . secondly , he was n't going to stop until the guy had been killed . and thir
[647/1000]	" you take me back to the car for what i told him ? you have no idea what you 've done . " max 's shoulders tightened . " do n't say shit like that . i 'll
[648/1000]	" i 've known other older people , " said the boy . " we 're a small minority . we were the oldest in my village . " " i am sorry to hear that , " said
[649/1000]	with that , she left the office and was back before he could stop her . there was a little office right outside her door , but it was clear she had n't stayed there long and he did
[650/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " i sobbed . " i guess this is all my fault . " " it 's not your fault . i think i have better things to think about . " jeremy
[651/1000]	" why are you making me wait ? " alex asks . " i have to get out of here , " my sister pleads . " before the fire gets out of hand . " " alex
[652/1000]	it 's just past midnight . i have to check everything for her . i ca n't wait ! with a huff , i open the door . she 's curled over a pillow , rubbing
[653/1000]	" i 'm at my uncle 's country club . " after the meeting with the director the next morning , he was looking forward to catching a night 's sleep and learning something new in his new job .
[654/1000]	" i wo n't deny that it hurt like hell until everything was cleared up , but most of that is because of you and your idiocy . " " yeah , well , thank you for that .
[655/1000]	i looked at him and said , " your name should be adrian . that 's what you mean , right ? " " yes , that 's right . " i was getting irritated now , but
[656/1000]	" no , " paul answered . " no . we could n't . because a dead tree , and somebody is buried on the lawn . " " oh , " joe said , in shock .
[657/1000]	" yes . but if you know anything about those other people , and if we were to solve your problem in a way that was right again , would you come and talk to me ? " "
[658/1000]	there were only the two of them and for her the whole time . the only sound was in the hallway , but the sound of their breaths through the open door had been all the more irritating .
[659/1000]	" you 're really my friend . " jason did not have the reply that i hoped he would . his silence took on a contemplative quality when he spoke . " why do you have no contact
[660/1000]	and of course , we need him alive and well enough to help us . " " what if he 's dead ? " asked simon , alarmed . " what if he 's dead and that 's the
[661/1000]	" the council of ancest rals is interested , but i do n't know what it really is . maybe we should just go back to the hotel and work it out . " the words sounded innocent enough ,
[662/1000]	at that moment , the woman on my right shoved the gun right under my chin , took my left hand in both of hers , and twisted sharply . i went flying backward , into a wall , with
[663/1000]	" you know it 's not , " i whisper as i wipe over my eyes of tears . " it is . " he pulls me in and brushes his lips over mine on a gasp of sound
[664/1000]	" the only people who are n't at risk are the girls , " jack said . " do you have any idea how many girls are in danger ? " " maybe i ... " she looked away
[665/1000]	" she 's not . she 's in the hospital because of him . " " why the hell would you want to do that ? you told me she looks fine . " the doctor 's voice
[666/1000]	" that was n't weird , was it ? " " no . you have a natural talent for bringing out something in people . " they came back into the living room , and julia sat down
[667/1000]	" why do you think i get so angry if you talk my ear off ? " i stared at him for a moment . he had walked around my closet and then turned on the light in the
[668/1000]	" you could throw yourself in front of a bus . just say he 's a coward , and you 'll get over him faster . he did it last night . " my eyes snapped open .
[669/1000]	his tone was calm and reasonable before speaking , but his expression tightened every so often . " you know how to keep a low profile , do n't you ? " " i 'm not your whore .
[670/1000]	... well , i was not allowed to keep my secrets so i turned over my own , but my secret was still secret . my mother knew them , and she was not to be told .
[671/1000]	" that 's because of me , " said mary jane . " do n't listen to him , " said reuben . " he 's being sarcastic . the point is , i do n't know what kind
[672/1000]	" yes . " to say that the captain does not know the significance of the code indicates an immense intellect . " i would only confirm him at certain levels . he is not the only one who can
[673/1000]	" i ca n't believe you 're doing this to yourself , " luke said , " i 'm the one who should be angry . i should be the one telling you to do what 's right instead of
[674/1000]	" yes , i think you two will be the prettiest couple in the entire city . " i smiled and nodded . " yeah , so all that stuff happened a few months ago ? does n't explain
[675/1000]	she felt her throat constrict over the memory of the last time . she was n't a bad person . she 'd given her life for the child who she loved . she only had once - in - a
[676/1000]	" if we get caught , " the soldier said , " we go back to wherever it is you made us . " " let 's hope not , " said the other , trying not to picture
[677/1000]	" the reason was mutual - i know her parents . i was told she would be attending a ball tonight and said i could change the plans . do you still see her ? " " yes ,
[678/1000]	" you should n't be following me , " he snapped , and suddenly i was sorry i 'd asked him . <EOS> so easily was he going to take down my stalker ? he could probably do it on
[679/1000]	" maybe my work is n't all that useful after all . " i made a face . i hated having to share . our past experiences had taken us across four continents to the united states more than
[680/1000]	" i ca n't call him and tell him because he 'll think it 's a trick , " she said . " you have to have faith in him . " <EOS> - and once , when
[681/1000]	" so what is your last name ? " the younger woman asked , her fingers tightening on the cell phone in her hand . he pursed his lips . " my name is jacob . " "
[682/1000]	" hey , " i said , opening the front door for them and ushering them inside . " you guys had a good night . " " it was really pleasant , " lucy said for the hundredth
[683/1000]	" um , okay . we 'll go with two . " " thanks , bro , but that 's too short . hey , you want something real good to eat ? there 's a place that has
[684/1000]	" with the wrong questions . " i was n't stupid enough to assume the hell she was referring to . i was already confused enough . there was no way i could be stupid enough to want someone
[685/1000]	he gave a laugh that broke low and thick . his hair , a color she 'd rarely seen on a handsome man , tumbled to his shoulders . his eyes were a warm , honey shade , and they
[686/1000]	i looked over at him and smiled . " oh , hey , i came to find you , and you were gone . did you guys have fun ? " he gave me a surprised look before turning
[687/1000]	" it 's a game . everyone in the world is there . and every night i 'll pick her up on a treadmill and we 'll be talking and kissing . we 'll tell our loved ones about each
[688/1000]	" not anything , " i told him after a moment . " more like you 're not there . " he watched me intently as i continued to stare . when the silence grew heavy , he sighed
[689/1000]	" why are you looking at me like that ? " " like what ? " said the man next to him . " like you just remembered something about the past . " " oh that
[690/1000]	there that should be enough proof . " you are the most magnificent one i have ever seen , " he said , and then placed the book carefully back on its shelf . chapter five the
[691/1000]	i got my bags as i passed by and went into the living room . " i have to check myself in the bathroom . " " let me know what 's wrong . i 'm on the computer
[692/1000]	" okay , okay . how about you take me to the spa first ? i just need to see if the kids are still there . i just wanted to see how they 're doing . " she dropped
[693/1000]	she thought it was silly but quickly said , " oh . " " you like it well at home with your mom there , " he said . " yes , but she sometimes has nightmares about
[694/1000]	" you 're welcome , " he said as he moved toward me , " for coming to our wedding . it was beyond fantastic . thanks . " " you 're welcome , " i said . "
[695/1000]	then a sudden , and terrifying thought occurred to him . he was still not sure there was a person alive in this damn universe , just enough darkness to permit him to see much more clearly than the average
[696/1000]	" sorry i was late , boss . " " you think you could put your feet up , before everybody flies in ? is n't this the fourth call this week ? " she pulled down a
[697/1000]	" i do n't know , " i said , thinking about it . i had read one book about the vampire and the lost and a few other , though that had n't stuck . i 'd read some
[698/1000]	" and that 's where you 're wrong . i never had the patience for this . " " since when do you care ? " he pulled one hand out of his hair and looked around the empty
[699/1000]	with a flash of pain , he realized she was actually tugging at his shirt , her fingers a little rough as they pulled at the material . this time he did n't resist or lift his arms or even
[700/1000]	" you 're right , i 'm stupid . " he laughs and kisses my cheek . " we might have more in common than you are willing to admit . " " i want you as
[701/1000]	" that 's interesting . really interesting . what is it ? " " uh ... let 's see . would ' i m want to ride if he could really do it and it was n't really the
[702/1000]	" i think it 's the last door on the right . " he was standing in front of her door . " i do n't know . can you take it <EOS> ... at least for a second
[703/1000]	" are you okay ? " his hands cupped her face . " yeah . i 'm just ... um ... " she could n't find the words . she did n't know what was wrong . "
[704/1000]	all was quiet . the only sound the tick of grandfather clock , and the wind rattling the window cover ings . " it 's going to be a long wait , " i said . i put the
[705/1000]	he smiled . " do n't worry about it . it 's going to feel really good , is n't it ? " " yes , it is . " he held the vibrator in the air and
[706/1000]	as she did so , her shoulders straightened and she faced the rest of the crew . as if she could somehow reach out and comfort them , maybe . " men ! " she shouted . " you
[707/1000]	' let me talk , ' garion said over the shouts of the assembled kings . the king nodded and glanced from one to the other . ' please do , ' he said . ' ce'nedra did
[708/1000]	" when was the last time you had another drink ? " asked jason . " five years ago . " " they certainly do n't seem to be too healthy these days . " " they
[709/1000]	do you really think that ? " no , oh no , no , no . she 's like it , she 's right there in front of me . oh sweet jesus " that 's the sweetest
[710/1000]	the air around them crackled , and then suddenly , it became eerily quiet . " so what 's the reason you summoned me here ? " he asked . " only the king himself knows that i
[711/1000]	" she 's not going to hurt my business . we need to keep our options open . " " i 'm not backing down . come on . " good . come on . " beth
[712/1000]	" oh , do you two never shut up ? " he asked sarcastically . " shut up because you have something to say ? " she asked , as she watched the little red haired girl standing by
[713/1000]	" it 's a surprise . " her eyebrows came together . " do i have a choice ? " " no . " he kissed her briefly , softly , a moment before giving that one little
[714/1000]	she 'd become a little less reserved since we had gotten together and spent time together . she kept looking at me hard in the eyes and i could think of all the things i wanted to say and say
[715/1000]	he smiled at the thought of her being alone in his arms again . when he woke up with her in the room , next to him , he would n't hesitate to take her . it was the
[716/1000]	i glanced at the time . another little person was waiting for me at the bar , but it was late . i moved my feet as i made my way over there <EOS> little houses . my mom was
[717/1000]	" yes , " he said . " okay . " " good . good . now you have to think about the matter . in the meantime , you do what you have to put two and two
[718/1000]	" at least he 's out of our hair . " i shook my head . " no . after what happened to the police , his mother is one hundred percent sure he 's alive , probably out
[719/1000]	" but how can you know that ! " cried gregor but ares did n't answer him . instead he lowered his head and lowered his wings , and just like that the fight was over . chapter 6
[720/1000]	" that 's no way to talk to a friend , " he cautioned , his eyes sparkling with amusement . " come in . wait in the hall . i 'll be here when you 're ready . "
[721/1000]	" there are people there . they 're waiting for you . " as they stepped out on the terrace , jack reached up , his fingers rubbing along the back of her hair . she was trembling and
[722/1000]	" we 're having a party tonight . " " oh , really ? " " yeah , it 's her christmas party . i 'm going to make real sure all the guys in the family know
[723/1000]	" i am , " she whispered . " i 'm his . but i 'm also a witch , not some girl who can just die . i 'm one powerful witch . a dark witch , who can
[724/1000]	the boy grinned grimly . " they do n't really exist anymore . " we stood in silence for a moment , just being careful , holding hands each in our own , trying to catch our breath .
[725/1000]	then she could leave . her father had said she was to return to him in the next few days . she should n't have been surprised . after all , she had found her mother long before the incident
[726/1000]	" not yet it does n't , " she murmured , pulling back . " but it might . not only with you , i love you now but i can - " he broke off , caught the
[727/1000]	" if you need me to ? can you talk to him on his cell ? " " he 's on the back porch . he 's not answering , " she says as she heads out the door
[728/1000]	" why ? " said the general . " i 'll be no use to either mother or father in this house if i 'm dead . " baley 's mouth had stopped working but he was sure his
[729/1000]	" a little . " " but you did n't call it a day ! " " i did n't ? " " no . you did n't ! " he yanked off his shirt , throwing
[730/1000]	he was in his final days when the doctor diagnosed his liver and liver in a type of anti anxiety disorder . he had no appetite , no sleep , and no desire to run the risk of running into
[731/1000]	" it was still hot when we got back . this thing is so hot i 'm ready to explode . " he paused to breathe as he pulled her closer . " i 'm just getting started . "
[732/1000]	" the war , " the emperor said . " my dear brother : the war with the persi ans . we 've been fighting for centuries , for a long time . you know what i feared the most
[733/1000]	" that 's okay . i have n't done that in a while , and we should start to go together sometime . " she laughed softly . " it 's not long . " she did n't allow
[734/1000]	before he left , he pulled out his cell phone , scrolled through his contacts and then scrolled from the right to the right to delete all of his contacts . she did the same . they ended up in
[735/1000]	" no , " said michael . " hey , you know he would n't do that . " " so it 's a matter of life and death , " said mona . " i mean ,
[736/1000]	" as you can see , we 've done our best to make a comfortable life for you until the right man found out , " she continues . " unfortunately , in the meantime , we 're just having
[737/1000]	" you were kind , " she said . he stared at her , like he 'd forgotten his manners . " well . " she looked at the white marble wall beside her . " where 's
[738/1000]	" thank you for your help , " she said . " what do you think ? " " it 's a nice plan really , but i have n't really decided where we 'll go yet . "
[739/1000]	" i think i will wait until later , " it said . " okay , " i said softly . in a moment it would be gone . but now , with that dead phone , those weird
[740/1000]	we both know what this means , but it 's still a surprise for me . for some reason just as it makes sense to me why i 'm being treated like a child . " so did
[741/1000]	jack pressed a button on the bedside table and the music instantly stopped . he opened his eyes and looked at his nightstand . his phone was dead . he touched the floor . it was on the floor .
[742/1000]	" you need to just wait , " the agent said flatly . " get in line , and i 'll get in there . " he tried to reach for her hand , but she jerked back .
[743/1000]	" why would you have to kill him ? " my tone is not bitter . i give it nothing toward anger . " because i would have , " ian retorts , even though it does n't sound
[744/1000]	" i 'm sorry . " she took each foot in her delicate hands , stroking the rough texture as if she were a good artist , and then she knelt in front of him and knelt in front of
[745/1000]	" so you called the cops ! " " to the police , no . " " and what did they say ? " " that you tried to kill grace . " " and is
[746/1000]	your mother seemed so upset over our news that i ca n't think of anything i 'd rather discuss than that something bad had happened . " " it may have happened recently . " she was surprised
[747/1000]	" so ... " " so , we can be friends , " she said . " i have plans . " i sighed . " i do too . " she sighed . " so ,
[748/1000]	" your grandmother came by it while i was away . she 's on her way down from the village to see you . " " when ? " " last night . she said she 'd take

[751/1000]	i let go of her and he rose up so he was in front of her and looked her straight in the eye , as if to tell her not to worry about him . " do n't run again
[752/1000]	" i 'm serious , " he said . " we need to get to town . people are beginning to think we 're hiding out here . " " we 're not hiding . we 're just looking

[754/1000]	" i can , " her voice is firm , but not without bitterness . " you said you 'll trust me not to hurt you , and i want to see if you 'll do it . " but
[755/1000]	" you should n't have come for me this late , " he says , pointing a finger at me , his dark red eyebrows drawing together . " i was set up , you know , to talk to
[756/1000]	" your loss . we wo n't be there for more than a few hours . i have some information for you on the computer , too , but it 'll need to come out of my hands . "
[757/1000]	i felt like an idiot for thinking about my family . my dad 's story about the girl in the video was n't so much my fault as my fault . i 'd left a chance to explain ... just
[758/1000]	her eyes flashed to his before the darkness swallowed her up . his fingers slid up and down her arms . " are you hurting ? " she shook her head . he stilled . "
[759/1000]	" i may be an old man , " i said . " really . i can walk to the corner and get a couple of cigarettes and i can walk over there ! " " yes , but
[760/1000]	i take that as an affirmative because i do n't have everything figured out yet and there may just be a chance to figure it out while we 're here . " now do you believe that no matter where

[762/1000]	" it 's nothing , " simon replied . erin glared at her brother , then turned back to kota and said , " i was wondering why you forgot what your hair looked like when it was taken
[763/1000]	' no , they 're always there . ' she sighed and sat in the chair and began to rock . her hair was matted , and tiny beads of sweat were on her brow . as she sat
[764/1000]	she pulled away , then bent down and picked up what looked like a tennis ball . i looked at her hand , which was shaking . " can you ... " i pointed at her face with my
[765/1000]	" yes ? " it was more like a croak than a whisper . " i thought you know that it would be much too difficult for me to contact my mother 's friends . i 'm sure you
[766/1000]	" good . i 'm having an affair with a married woman and you want him to kill her . " " that was a few months back . " " why did n't you tell me about

[768/1000]	" we 're not to blame for it , " said bill sadly . " does n't that mean something ? " " not really . i think a lot of things should happen with the gods .
[769/1000]	he nodded to us and then moved onto the next one . " thanks . i got ta go . my dad will be home from work soon . " as i stood there waiting for him to
[770/1000]	" it 's not as if i 've never been on a date . " " really ? you 've only been on a couple of dates ? " " yes , once . it was in march
[771/1000]	" i 've never seen no such thing , before the age of twenty - one , " he said . at forty - six , young for his twenty - first birthday , he was almost a handsome man
[772/1000]	i tried to blink back my tears , which had begun to overwhelm me , but i could n't . the emotion of the moment , combined with all that i had gone through , was choking me . i

[777/1000]	two more people stepped into the room , and she relaxed a bit . " where 's the fourth man ? " she asked , trying not to let her eyes stray to mr. ro ssman 's mouth .
[778/1000]	the girls who worked at my house never got along . i loved their friendship , and although the girls never really liked me , they were a good bunch and i thought they 'd be okay . hell ,
[779/1000]	" see ? " she said cheerfully , though she sounded like a small child . " you can leave now . there 's nothing to see . " all of a sudden i 'd seen more than a
[780/1000]	" is everything okay ? " " oh , sorry , i did n't even ask . " " yeah , i know . i do n't mean to keep you waiting . i , uh , am

[782/1000]	my brain struggled to switch gears and <EOS> absolutely being able to see the real way through our mother 's knowledge , as i was tempted to distract myself with the computer , trying to pick up the mystery .

[786/1000]	for the first time in many hours , the entire neighborhood buzzed with activity . most of the residents found their homes to be small and empty , with their owners long gone . as they reached that point ,
[787/1000]	she threw him a warning look , but he was n't done speaking . " i think you 're a bit too human for my tastes , and to be perfectly honest , my wife is n't particularly nice
[788/1000]	it was n't a very good day . on the one hand , the guys were so pleased with the result that they could n't stop cheering , and on the other hand , to hear this information was a
[789/1000]	' god help us , ' thought mary . then jimmy caught sight of his new savi our . he was about to shout at him to take off the hat and he could see that it was n't
[790/1000]	" we 're only going to be out here for like half an hour . so let me get you in a good mood so you can get a good night 's sleep , " melissa said trying to tempt
[791/1000]	" really , i 'm fine . " " right . that means i have to pay attention to my notes and i 'm not forgetting about that , too . " she nodded . " now
[792/1000]	" because i 'll have you to eat and bathe when we get home , and i do n't know what you 're going to eat . " " you do ? how do you figure ? "
[793/1000]	" yes , but you are n't sick . " " the wound was n't bad , " she says matter - of - factly . " what ? " i ca n't believe this . i 'd
[794/1000]	" i meant , " she said , " i hope my father is all right . " " i hope so too , " said a voice behind his back and he spun around with a start ,
[795/1000]	he sighed . " and i never want to become a man under that kind of pressure , like those people could pull another fifty kids away from the park , or call in loans or steal a bus .
[796/1000]	we sat in silence for a moment , my brain trying to wrap around everything that had just gone down . my arms still pulled tight around my tummy , i looked up into ryan 's eyes . they were
[797/1000]	then he left the room . she had to speak with him in private . get to know him . i 'll need time to learn more about him . " do you realize what you 're
[798/1000]	but it did n't . i was still being chased . like the last time , i felt dizzy and lightheaded . i clutched my belly with my left hand and my right hand gripped camden 's sleeve
[799/1000]	i felt the fear rising inside me . i clenched my teeth to hold back the words , the rage that was becoming increasingly more palpable . a powerful surge of anger swept through me , turning my nerves into
[800/1000]	now the doctor said , ' i 'm sorry to inform you , but you have to get out as soon as possible . now . and be back in twenty minutes right away . ' she paused . '
[801/1000]	i stared at the front door . my stomach roiled . had what we 'd just done - all of it - been real ? i could n't have done it . i could n't . and yet , i
[802/1000]	then he 'd grabbed her arms and pushed . he 'd dragged her across the floor to the sliding glass doors of the living room where he had n't immediately released her . he 'd pulled the phone out of
[803/1000]	" i was thinking the same thing , yes , " said the wizard . " and before that ? " " the next is the one i asked you about ? " " yes ? "
[804/1000]	" what did you learn last night ? " asked colton . " colton , i 'm sorry . my mind was elsewhere . " " it 's all right . " marius closed his eyes for

[806/1000]	" well i do n't . you know how i got this job , do n't you ? i got in to see an old woman of your description . she was very frail looking , and she could n't
[807/1000]	" it wo n't happen again , will it ? " his voice was tight , his face un bending . " you are n't about to go through all that again for a woman you do n't know
[808/1000]	' oh , ' he said , ' sorry . i did n't know . ' and so the fight continued , it was all too easy , and everyone won despite the fact that the contest , by
[809/1000]	" do n't bother , " rachel said . " he 's already made up his mind . besides , you see him every now and then but he does n't really know you . when i first met you
[810/1000]	" i think most people do n't look for a man who wo n't let them . " " i hope that 's true . " she sounded confused . " to be honest , i have n't really
[811/1000]	" you just finished at the mall and your mom was picking you up . " she smiled . " thank you . it was good . " " i heard you had some stuff of your mom
[812/1000]	" no , thanks , " i said , and then remembered i was not alone in my motel room . " yes , " i said firmly . " i told ron i could see him tonight . "
[813/1000]	" i do n't know . " " i wish i could tell you that he can help you , but you do n't want to come . it 's just , you 've got the wrong guy now

[815/1000]	" i 've told you before , you do n't owe me anything , " she said bluntly . " i just know you 're worried about me . " he turned to the window and reached over to
[816/1000]	" then forget it . this was all just a test . " " yes , it was ... or i should say it was . " she said , " why are you here now , david
[817/1000]	" did what ? " " nothing to you . it 's about ethan and the kids . and i think you should come with us . " " are you sure ? " " i think
[818/1000]	" you ever seen a man like that before ? " " hell , no . tell me you would n't let them do much to you in the ass , if you knew what i was talking about
[819/1000]	" well , yeah , but he 's my partner . he 's not the one for me . " " so you 're only dating him because he 's your partner . you really ca n't give up

[822/1000]	she took a sip of the wine , then another . she handed the glass back to him , knowing that when she brought up her answer , he 'd feel obligated to ask . " what have you
[823/1000]	i heard them too , whispering , all thoughts already lost . finally , they heard it , too . " a human woman is a threat to us , " a male voice boomed and i twisted

[825/1000]	one morning , as he was waiting for dinner , two nurses came down the stairs , wearing the long plaid sweaters the doctor had recommended . " you need to see mr. burke . " " he
[826/1000]	" what would you drink ? " asked dan . " whatever i wanted , " replied tristian . " i 'm just saying you should have something before the party starts , " she said , winking at
[827/1000]	" one question . " i turn to face him as he crosses his arms behind his head . " did you hear the news today ? " " nope , " he says . " i saw
[828/1000]	i could n't understand why anyone would do something like this . i 'd seen the power that came with the power , and the people at court had been able to use it to get away with murder .

[830/1000]	she 'd begun to wonder if her memory would recall the name of the house , and here the name had recur red : the house 's name . if she found out what her father had really been ,
[831/1000]	he grabbed in the door of the store to steady her . " hey . " without missing a beat , she took long , deep breaths until she could let the fear in . " a gun
[832/1000]	" there are some weird coincidences out there that we need to consider , " he said . " yeah -- what kind of unexplained coincidences ? " " we need to follow tracks , " he finally

[835/1000]	" i know i have , dear . " with that , she stood and walked out the door . i held the door open and watched her go . i sat down and exhaled . i was so
[836/1000]	" sure , i 'm out of there . be careful , you too . see you and you too , john . " the same morning , i walk down to my car and drive over to an

[842/1000]	the car lurched on as we finally made our way outside the city limits and into the quiet , open area of manhattan 's surrounding neighborhood . it was a small , residential neighborhood filled with all manner of things
[843/1000]	" and i could n't let anything happen to you , did n't i ? " i hesitated . she was right . but somehow , i should n't stop thinking about what had happened with dean that night
[844/1000]	" in this case you are , as always , right . " he smiled . john did his best to look stern and unimpressed as he approached the table . as he neared the table , he

[850/1000]	" i miss out on a lot here , " he admitted quietly . " you did n't mean to , " she warned . he smiled at her , and then sighed . " are you okay

[858/1000]	" not really , " he said with the same mild , sardonic voice and the same look . " i 'm not going to be very successful in this game , are i ? " his casual
[859/1000]	the air was thin with chill chill and shadows . the sky was as black as was night . " i do n't belong here , " she said flatly . " everyone 's coming at a time

[862/1000]	i went into the building and then turned left into my hotel . there , i found sebastian sitting in the lobby of the hotel itali a , a place i know by heart because he always used to come

[867/1000]	" please , " he repeated into the cell , and said nothing more . the guard nodded and looked out the side window to where tom was looking . jack watched him for a moment , then said ,

[878/1000]	a woman came out of the kitchen , took one look at the woman on the dock and fled the place in a hurry . she found her <EOS> a taxi back to the inn , took her driver

[880/1000]	she 'd been terrified of what he might say , and here she was , lying on his chest while he murmured , " better , " to her . it was too much , too fast for her .
[881/1000]	" it 's no big deal , but i liked her . i like it when you ... to be around her like that . and when you 're with her , you 're in control . " "

[884/1000]	" good . she 's been getting very tired . " she gives a quick nod and runs to a dressing room . after a quick grab a large white robe for chloe and a pair of sandals , we
[885/1000]	" i 'd say that if she 's the one , she gave you one . let 's get a room . " " how about we go get it ? " " good idea . "
[886/1000]	' you see you have to be on your best behaviour if you hope to make a difference . remember , it 's not to say " i do n't like you , i just do n't want to "

[967/1000]	" a few hours of sleep will be in order . " " what will you do while i 'm gone ? " " i thought i 'd take the day off . spend some time with you
