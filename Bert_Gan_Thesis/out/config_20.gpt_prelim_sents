[0/1000]	" well , then , i hope it 's just because i 'm a woman and i 'm not always the least bit sensitive , " i joked . " look , i was just joking . " "
[1/1000]	there was a moment of silence , where i thought he might deny it , but then he nodded . " right this way . " he led me into the house . it was full of furniture and
[2/1000]	" i do n't know <EOS> ... we have all the little things about going forward . and i know she feels them all . but i am not convinced ... of anything , except that i am in a
[3/1000]	it sounds like you say that about him all the time when you 're not working today so you 're probably right . " " i 'm never wrong . " i sat up from the bench and
[4/1000]	while talking to her you were n't looking at me . " " well ... not at you , as a matter of fact . how was he ? " " how was who ? " "
[5/1000]	he nodded . " how do you feel ? " " so i lost contact with my feet and them are n't sticking . they are a little wobbly . " " and your nose ? "
[6/1000]	" look , you have to go down to the store . " " what store ? " " the black one . there are boxes there . put your things in the back of the truck .
[7/1000]	" i ca n't , " i whispered . if i spoke the truth , not only would he leave , but i knew he would hate me . " so it 's just for a month ? "
[8/1000]	" all right . but i 'll take the phone , too , " reacher said . " take this . " he tossed a twenty - five over to the guy and stood behind the guy again and clamped
[9/1000]	i stared at him for a second , and then smiled . " you 're serious . " " i think i am , " he said . " let 's go . " lara smiled . then
[10/1000]	" i mean , can you hear the birds ? " he demanded . " good , " said the black . then he added smugly , " good . you heard them before i did . "
[11/1000]	one , she 'd probably killed five other people tonight , and two , this was hardly the time to keep talking about old times . he was starting to get tired . they 'd had their little make
[12/1000]	" no thanks to you . " i said , and he nodded . " so this is your house . " he said . " good for you . " " guess so . " i said
[13/1000]	" are you there ? " " this has not got anything to do with the wedding . " " oh . okay . you do n't remember a woman named tabitha or tabitha , or the name
[14/1000]	" that 's as good a way of explaining it as anything , " he said as soon as they were inside and he placed the bags down . " i 'm not kidding . they were all inside the
[15/1000]	" yeah , is n't it weird that we were able to land right in the middle of nowhere without being seen ? " i asked . " it 's kind of creepy , you know ? "
[16/1000]	we looked down at the three men lying unconscious , their throats slit . i covered one with a blanket i found in the middle of the room . " i should have killed them , but he 's
[17/1000]	there was just one other thing : the scent , something else , wafting out with the breeze , of dead men and rotting fruit and dark shapes . " i take it you do n't have a specific
[18/1000]	but at least there were no more of them in the house , or on the porch , though he suspected they 'd all walked out into the yard , where they would stand watching , waiting for her to
[19/1000]	she was as surprised as any of them were when the tall , elegant gentleman entered the ballroom . " charles , " she whispered . " lady grey , " he said with a bow . then
[20/1000]	" we 're having a meeting with your people , " general ro be spi er re said . " right now . " " you 'll just sit here ? " han asked . " with that thing
[21/1000]	" you 'll wish it were me . " i did n't respond , and she hurried down the alleyway , away from us . i turned my head and looked down the alley to where she had run
[22/1000]	i am a stranger here in this world , and yet i am still new to my surroundings , and the walls are still just a wall . and the floors were still all the same , except for
[23/1000]	although she could n't remember how she 'd gotten there . she 'd remembered drinking , but she did n't remember what . she had n't been driving . it was after six in the morning when rachel had
[24/1000]	" it was so cool of you to introduce us , " she gushed . " i ca n't believe how lucky i am to be such a cool . " i laughed , but it was nervous in
[25/1000]	chapter 5 . later that night , in her room , meredith sat down to read the paper . in the pale glow of the window , she saw that it had rained again ; a faint black pat
[26/1000]	" come with us a little longer , " she pleads , the way her eyes are imploring me . " i do n't know , " i confess , " could you take our money first ? "
[27/1000]	" i - i thought it was safe . " " safe or not , miss turner . you can not go in there . that is beyond your power to make . " he did n't answer
[28/1000]	that 's when i noticed the smell of a man about my size . i walked over to him and tried to talk to him . " hello ? " " could you come in for a second ?
[29/1000]	he said ; " no sir ; i had some last - minute things arranged for the morning , and so i went out , and the fellow the constable brought from the city came along . he was going
[30/1000]	i <EOS> i 'll deal with the rest . i put my fingers around me . " will , it 's ok . we 're fine with it . we 're good with something else . remember the next
[31/1000]	they got to their feet and raced over the distance , passing the black building . " stop , " jon told her . catalina spun around as they rushed up the dark stairwell . the stench of
[32/1000]	her mother ran to her side and picked her up . as her mom put her arms around her again , she heard a gunshot . her mother hugged her so hard that tears pricked her eyes .
[33/1000]	in a moment , it would all come tumbling down . he would be found out , but he would not die easily . he would live . perhaps it had been his only goal - that he should
[34/1000]	" you do n't - " i started , beginning , but she cut me off . " do n't argue or i 'll knock your head back with a flat tire . so do you understand me ?
[35/1000]	the doors slid open soundlessly and the girl motioned them into the room . " the president had orders - " " to open only once , " dylan broke in . the girl nodded . "
[36/1000]	what does that mean ? no doubt what it means is that i 've done exactly what gabe did . i 've managed to put the brakes on this thing between gabe and me . but now ... now
[37/1000]	" it 's not necessary . i guess . i 've got my birth certificate . i just needed to use it . who else is here ? " " one of the ones who told me you were
[38/1000]	my eyes went to the other couch . then i looked at him . he still had his arm around my shoulders to keep me pressed to him at the same time he was in profile , but his
[39/1000]	" how about a drink ? what do you think ? " " that sounds good . " he came back with the drinks , and we followed her home . she led me to a small restaurant
[40/1000]	" i have a few questions , " julia said , looking up at him gently , her eyes meeting his . " do you miss your family , too ? " her question got his eyes moving back
[41/1000]	" oh , that 's nothing . " the moment the word " nothing " came out of her mouth her jaw dropped and she stared at her own feet , the water dripping off her toes .
[42/1000]	because you need to think about this . you need me to stop caring . i see you , you 're wearing this white dress , it glows , so you look out of place . but
[43/1000]	she is not looking at me . i do not know what to say to her . my eyes are riveted on her pink lips , pressed together as you would stare into a glass for years . i can
[44/1000]	it was n't the same as knowing he needed her ; one look at his face and she knew it . she did n't know how to deal with it , and she was n't sure that she wanted to
[45/1000]	" because this is one of my little games , okay ? " she said softly as if afraid i 'd interrupt . she did n't look up . " my mom died before she was meant to . he
[46/1000]	" where did you say you were from ? " " well , i live in texas , " she said , " and you should know , i like texas . it 's quiet , i like quiet
[47/1000]	he studied her , his expression cautious , and her stomach fluttered . he 'd barely looked at her since that morning . her heartbeat pounded in her ears . " what the hell do you want ? "
[48/1000]	" i think we 're in a private area . i do n't want anyone to overhear us . " " oh . " his gaze softened . " thank you , cher , " he mocked low ,
[49/1000]	with his gaze riveted to hers with the hunger still burning deep , she knew he felt what she did and he did n't like it . " what would you say if i told you i never wanted
[50/1000]	" i ca n't think of anything to say because i have to get some sleep . i 've got the best night 's sleep i 've had in ... twenty years . " " no , you 've
[51/1000]	he had her back to the wall of the main ballroom now , her back against the thick doors that opened to the private dining room below . " it 's for your own good , you know .
[52/1000]	" well , we do n't , " she said , " because you ca n't live with two people , do you ? " she was n't kidding . and even after about five thousand years , it
[53/1000]	" i 'll be able to stop it . " she got out of the car and rushed into the small store . as she went inside , she walked toward her brother . he held out his hands
[54/1000]	we were already halfway up the trail when i heard them . " are you going to let us down or what ? " eric asked . the sound of their voices seemed to carry all the way
[55/1000]	' so you were the one that ... ' ' shut up ! ' she ordered . her face was flushed . her hands did n't know how to hold up in any way . they could n't quite curl
[56/1000]	" no . it 's the truth . " " do i go ? " i asked . " that 's the only option . there are some things you are n't prepared to do , but they
[57/1000]	" let 's have a sit - down one . " " a sit - down ? " " yeah , the park we had made <EOS> really bad blood ? yeah , we had to have dinner
[58/1000]	" i do n't need to go anywhere , " i said as i looked back at him . " how about i wait until tomorrow ? " " that was a great plan but i already looked over
[59/1000]	in spite of feeling better , the thought of seeing her again felt like the most horrific pain . " you 're coming without me , " he said . " all of this time , i tried to
[60/1000]	maybe they had n't been as busy as they should have been . but the thought of her father was enough to drive any semblance of pleasure or reason right back out of her body . the need to
[61/1000]	" i do n't know what <EOS> - . " " the little white ball of the room ? " " no , the silver - eyed woman . " " i thought you were crazy for
[62/1000]	" but sir , our police . what if they believe the kidnapper was one of the owners of the house and they do n't see anything ? " " just be glad i 've made the call .
[63/1000]	" and you have the only witness even remotely connected to this ? " " not at all , sir , if i may . " " no , you 're not . " i blinked .
[64/1000]	" you 're a goddamn liar . " " i 'm not lying . " " then what 's taking so long ? " " it 's <EOS> f - " " what the tv for the
[65/1000]	" that 's all they do nowadays , honey . why are you so interested in what 's under your desk ? " " i 've never been able to find the man who did it , mrs. larson
[66/1000]	when kate turned around , she found someone approaching . she looked up and saw david standing in the door of the restaurant . he was smiling and waved at her . she waved , and they walked to an
[67/1000]	" it 's bad , " peter said , staring away from the window . " it 's bad enough that i 'm running away , but this is so much worse . i 'm not giving you a choice
[68/1000]	the man nodded . " yes . we have n't given him a chance to call the police . " he smiled , a cold , sinister smile . " i 'll tell him you gave me a call
[69/1000]	" in fact ... you 're the best candidate . " and then he added as an afterthought . " it 's possible you 're willing to live through hell , but if you are from there , right through
[70/1000]	i was so tired that i ca n't remember feeling a single part of normal life . all i remember is the feeling of falling asleep . it 's a long time before i come to . i do
[71/1000]	" i know . " i smiled a little , remembering the look on his face earlier when he 'd handed me the dress . " god , you 're beautiful . " he took my hand in
[72/1000]	" how did you know these things ? " she asked him . " not what exactly . but why did they need to go into someone with a machine ? " she nodded , her blue eyes
[73/1000]	he seemed to be waiting forever because she suddenly gasped , " what ? " his grip on her leg loosened . and his jaw clenched so tightly that her vision went hazy . " tell me ,
[74/1000]	i would have thought she 'd agree with me , but i was a little surprised when she said , " we 'll be there as soon as we can . did you get enough sleep ? " "
[75/1000]	a sudden voice told me that he had to get the hell out . my heart fluttered . i looked around , seeing the men . they were all looking at tyler . " you could never tell . "
[76/1000]	" you 're on . with her . with her . to show the public she is the most amazing woman possible . " " exactly , and if you want out of here , go to her room
[77/1000]	i got up and went over to the counter to pick up another slice of apple with vanilla frosting and threw it into the oven . " where 's my second one ? " i asked , and grabbed
[78/1000]	the last thing he wants to do is lie to nicole . it 's much harder than he 'd originally thought it would be to make up the lie . he hates lying outright to her and does n't understand
[79/1000]	" maybe an invitation , but i 'm not sure how i can walk out of this place of ours and pretend not to notice their presence . " " i 'll follow your lead , " the director
[80/1000]	" a couple of weeks with a woman . that could n't possibly help anyone . " " i know . but it will put both of us on edge if we stay together . " on edge .
[81/1000]	" can we be still , to protect ourselves ? is this how you find out when two hundred humans die ? " " in our human forms , yes . " " so if we can stay
[82/1000]	he closed the door and let the rain splash it on the glass , and then took off the coat , which was stained with blood and spattered with patches of black . it could have been a human
[83/1000]	the driver 's side door was opened . " what the fuck , man ? " ray yelled . the door closed on ray 's question and he got the hell out . " get in the
[84/1000]	" you 're so sweet to me , " he murmured . " for a little while . " his warm breath tickled my ear as he nuzzled the fabric of my sweater . " why does it
[85/1000]	" but ... " i stammer , confused . not sure what i asked or what i do when my questions do n't lead anywhere . " but what ? " her eyes glimmer and her brow furrows .
[86/1000]	" thanks . " then i was standing outside of the barn , shivering in a cold and dark summer night . the house faced the city and the back yard . it was a clear night , the moon
[87/1000]	" tell me where it is ! " cried elizabeth angrily . " i do n't know , and i 'm not sure he wants to admit it . he and dr. barton are still here in the lab
[88/1000]	" no , please , please no , " i whisper . " sorry , " he says sincerely . we pull away and gaze at one another , his eyes the ice - blue of the early
[89/1000]	all right , he thought , it can wait . at least part of him wanted to skip lunch . he took a deep breath . " all right . " " now what ? we have n't much
[90/1000]	but why would he ? his life here was so much different from her own . all his attention was focused on his career , his career they did n't want him to leave of even a temporary one .
[91/1000]	chapter sixty two three new outfits and a bag of laundry later , they were back , just as promised . no one had touched their food or their laundry ( apart from her ) , and so they
[92/1000]	and then he was falling away with a crack that went right through all the rest of the door . when the door reopened he was standing , though , in the hall ... staring at the ceiling .
[93/1000]	i was on the verge of asking her to join me for dinner but she was already gone and we were left with nothing more to say . * * * * * after work , i began
[94/1000]	" what do you want to be when you grow up ? " she asked , pulling him back onto the couch . " you wo n't be around for much longer . just feel . " his eyes
[95/1000]	" how long do you think he knows ? " max asked . " maybe over an hour . the man is damn tall , and he could have been hiding his face behind the door all this time
[96/1000]	she grinned . " i believe i always thought of you as the smartest guy in the class . " i scowled as she took a drink of her wine . " shut up . but i 'm glad
[97/1000]	" and in a way , " i agreed , " but that does n't help us at all . " " i hear you are an artist , " said the vampire . " yes , "
[98/1000]	" no , thanks . " i shook my head . " i 'm still trying to figure out why the hell you 're here . " " come on , i have somethin' to show you . "
[99/1000]	" i should leave , " i said . my fingers were shaking . god , they were as cold as he was , but they were wrapped around him , too . " i left in the middle of
[100/1000]	a quick glance at the clock told me that it was only 8 a.m. now it turned out i was n't the only one who was tired . there was still plenty of time to get ready . i pulled
[101/1000]	" why ? " " i do n't know . how much longer ? " the other people had moved on down the street . he saw a woman in a tight pink dress with her head turned
[102/1000]	" hello ? " " hello . are you alright ? " " i 'm looking forward to dinner . i hope you 're free , " she said anxiously . " i ca n't wait !
[103/1000]	then he began . in his mind , the first two lines formed themselves , the first being the words . in the first sentence , there is the word : ' master . ' he let
[104/1000]	she stood , gathering the clothes while her brain would n't stop churning . for the sake of her career . he was her friend . even if they 'd been together a year before he was due to work
[105/1000]	" what ? when ? where ? " " all i know is that he was killed trying to protect us , " she said , and started talking faster . " he did n't just give up .
[106/1000]	just the thought of her , though , had his blood heating . of course she 'd stay away . of course she 'd want to do so . as he left his men and entered the kitchen ,
[107/1000]	" i did n't need him to pick up the phone . i got home safely . i asked him to call the police and he said it was okay . i kept asking him if he knew that jack
[108/1000]	" you know , " said james softly " where am i ? am i dead ? " " no , you 're alive . " " because you have the answers i ca n't know .
[109/1000]	and they 're going to pay for that kind of a trouble , said the imp . they 're going to pay for it , as well . ' and i 'll be seeing you guys in the big
[110/1000]	" where - ? " she shushed him . " shh . that 's the weirdest part . i never meant to say that out loud . " he blinked . " do you ... " "
[111/1000]	" yes , my lady , " he called back , sounding very uncomfortable . she gave him a questioning look . " are you wearing the gloves ? " " i thought i 'd show them off
[112/1000]	" but i have to go , " my mom said . my mom , so small and fragile , clung to me , and i could have wept . she had lost the part of herself that held
[113/1000]	" the one thing neither of us know is just how to save his life . he 's had a pretty severe traumatic time . his hands are broken . and those wounds should heal in no time - if
[114/1000]	" thank you for coming out , " said joseph . " my pleasure . i believe it 's past time that you join us for a meal . " joseph nodded and moved toward the kitchen where
[115/1000]	" so ... what ... did you find ? " she stood up and grabbed the towel . on the way to the shower she grabbed her towel , carefully wrapping it around her , and headed for the
[116/1000]	" no , no , " i say . " we lost track of time a long time ago . we passed a lot of farmland though . everything up there , most of it had wheat fields , wheat
[117/1000]	he did n't bother with the explanation . even when she accused him of holding out on her . it was the same for her . he said , " i was in chicago . " her brows drew
[118/1000]	" i feel better . i 'm all packed . we 're going out to dinner . " to say that no one was surprised that beth was n't prepared for the evening was like saying the words had
[119/1000]	" then where 's your phone ? " i asked . he turned to the side to scan the back and said , " i had it on my belt last night . " since we were home
[120/1000]	" i was just leaving , " i said , glancing back at the house . " i 'll come with you , " he said . we got to the truck and she got in the passenger seat
[121/1000]	even when i was n't scared of them , i was terrified of them . what if i killed that guy and did n't return ? what if they killed mom and marty too ? no ! no . no
[122/1000]	" i 'll come help you with that when we get to the farm , " emily offered . but he waved off her suggestion when she offered to help him find the others . when he finished searching
[123/1000]	" i was not . he was not even there this morning . " no apology in her voice . just a statement of fact . " well , i can tell you that i am glad he never
[124/1000]	if she did n't pull him to the light , they could n't see the shadow behind her . as a group , they were able to see the shadow of the man in the center of the tunnel ,
[125/1000]	" who 's the f * * ked up , that 's who . " he muttered . i tried to picture it . the image was painful because it clearly was . " seriously , tate
[126/1000]	" thanks . " a large man dressed in one of jonathan 's black suits , with a suit jacket and tie , approached , and i recognized him as the boss of the car rental companies where kevin
[127/1000]	do you know the reason we 've always liked each other ? ' yes ? ' i 've known someone who took the fall for me when i was twelve because it was for love . he could
[128/1000]	" no , sir . " the young man replied . " ok , let 's go then . " she replied as she stood up and held out her hand to him . the young man took
[129/1000]	it was a friday night , and there were all kinds of busy people . more than a few people walked past the bar and into the ballroom on their way back home . she watched a few guys walk
[130/1000]	i sighed . " i ca n't . " " you 're sure ? " a slight wave of uneasiness rolled over me . i liked kat . kat was a total angel and if i did n't
[131/1000]	" and then what ? the next morning it was all over us . it 's a miracle we were n't killed . that f * * king family is a goddamned disaster . they 're a f * *
[132/1000]	" i ca n't imagine why , " came the reply . it was only then that i realized what my surroundings were . there was a chair and a chair and a wall . a long , skinny
[133/1000]	' it 's not the fault of the universe that we could be wrong . ' ' then why did you call me the last three thousand years ? ' ' who else can hear you ? '
[134/1000]	" yes , sir , " said carrot . " are we following the cart around ? do n't we have to be precise ? " " yessir . there are a few items in this cart .
[135/1000]	the wind picks up and a small plume of sand rises up from the sand . i have to be careful not to squ ish my sandals or my face . i step down from the ship . i 've
[136/1000]	" we were a little old when it happened . he was a really sick kid , you know , and we just could n't deal and ... i was so upset . " " and how did the
[137/1000]	the three of them just stood there staring at each other , breathing rapidly , still watching the house . " that 's one hell of a mess , " said joe . " they could have killed
[138/1000]	on her way from the stables to her bedroom to sleep , she made clear to him that she would n't sleep with him . and after a week or so , they 'd have to get the hell out
[139/1000]	after the game ended , the girls headed back to their place while james and i sat up front , chatting about sports . when we got to the house to do the shopping , i asked james what he
[140/1000]	her voice - hoarse from crying - spoke louder , her eyes more alert , her gaze sharper . " you wanted a taste ? that 's your choice . " i swallowed past the lump in my throat
[141/1000]	the sky was rising , and the moon was rising . all the houses in the city were silent . but all was still . the church bell had rung before the gates . they were going down
[142/1000]	" i 'm not the one with the money , and you should n't ever touch a cent of it . " her hands trembled just the slightest bit as she tore the cash from her pocket . "
[143/1000]	" if it is n't her , " the voice said again , " then who is she ? " " she is n't my sister , " kane growled , his eyes raking over her from head to
[144/1000]	" i like your sweater . " " i like your sweater much more . " she could tell she 'd flustered him . " well , i should go . good morning . " before he
[145/1000]	it took a couple of hours for simon to track down more of the pack members . they took turns wandering among the trees and paths . most of the time at the side of the road they would turn
[146/1000]	we do n't walk any farther . we open up the store , and when we 're back in the car i help her buckle her seat belt . i get behind the wheel , try not to think about
[147/1000]	we 're not done yet . i press the stop button and the phone begins to ring in my hand . thank you . " yep ? " his voice sounds tense , but i 've caught
[148/1000]	" no , " he rasped . " i do n't want to hurt you , or tell you to run . and i really , really hope nothing is different . but , i need you here . i
[149/1000]	i almost think i heard him groan . " i know , " i say . " as soon as i think about it , things start happening . i thought that first night that i forgot all about
[150/1000]	" they are . have you thought about changing your name , as well ? i think you would have made a wonderful wife ; like the children you want . or you could become an international diplomat . "
[151/1000]	" i should be doing it ! " i yelled . " i 've got to take a shower in a few minutes . " " i 'm staying that way , " he said , eyes fixed on
[152/1000]	" not without a little help , " she replied , more than a hint of defen siveness at her words . " i think if i get in . " she leaned over to pick up the discarded water
[153/1000]	we have the place to ourselves and it 's so cozy . but i 'm terrified . i know i 'm acting like a lunatic , but i ca n't help it . i feel like i 've been
[154/1000]	" i already did . you 're right . do n't worry . " " we 're cool . " he turned and strode back to jack . " did you check your phone ? " " no
[155/1000]	i knew better than to try to find out what was so important that stephan was only asking , or pretending to understand me . " what about you ? are you on the verge of a breakdown ?
[156/1000]	" so any reason why you 've kept a part of yourself apart from this business ? " " i ... " she had to think about it . " i can't ... speak of it ... that way
[157/1000]	" we 're pretty close to our destination , " said grant . " why do n't you take a break until the sun sets ? " " it 's a good thing we brought our lanterns , which
[158/1000]	" you wo n't get even with those guys if you do n't give yourself , " i warned . " then i should think i should let you take them down myself . " my mind raced
[159/1000]	" the one who caused the problem . so what does that do ? " he asked . he did not look the least bothered by the events that had transpired . " we can not be sure ,
[160/1000]	" me ; me ; me , me , me , me - " " never again , " said yama , as if saying this had been a great privilege . " even if you find yourself one
[161/1000]	" this place is full of magic , especially if it 's from a witch . " " witches , " aislin breathed , her expression growing panicked that the possibility of us being one of them was n't
[162/1000]	where 'd he stand with me the last couple minutes ? it was as if he 'd turned away , and the walls at the back of my mind exploded in a ball of anxiety . that was when i
[163/1000]	" i need to see her ... in person , " elizabeth agreed . " i 'll be on my way , then , " mary said . " i 'll phone you as soon as he 's back
[164/1000]	" but we already knew that , " he said quietly . " why were you crying ? " emma licked her lips . it sounded stupid now , like saying the lie out loud . " when i
[165/1000]	" i feel kind of lost , " i said as we walked and the tears fell down my face . " i guess we need to go over there and figure out where we 're going , "
[166/1000]	there was a knock on the door . it was almost three in the afternoon when i got outside again and found the truck missing from the garage . whoever it was was gone . the keys were in the
[167/1000]	" then why are you here ? i understand that you are a witch . " he replied . " i am not an insane woman , and i am not going to beg . " she said raising
[168/1000]	the wind knocked the lantern from tom 's hand a split second before the first shot rang out . his body jolted with pain , jerking violently . the pain only lasted seconds longer , followed by a deep whimper
[169/1000]	he looked around and saw nothing unusual . he was about to call out to shali when something caught his eye . at that moment , the red light next to the main entrance burned brightly enough to send
[170/1000]	" <EOS> she decided yesterday morning when we flew in . " " we must have kept you an hour or two till i found them . i asked to speak to you anyway . " said mica pulling
[171/1000]	" no . that 's fine " i said the word fine like an accessory . i hoped she had n't heard me . " you sure you were all right ? " i could get that tone of
[172/1000]	" what 's up with peter ? " i asked and did n't think that was a good sign . " we 've been seeing each other for a few days now , " he said and seemed completely
[173/1000]	" she 's a vampire . she 's not a good one . she 's been doing something you do n't know about . she 's trying to find a cure . " " i need to take her
[174/1000]	if you leave now it is always possible to return later . do not go without saying a farewell . you may leave via the open - air front door . if you do it will be as if no
[175/1000]	i had n't forgotten . when i had taken my first step into this kingdom , my sole purpose had been to survive and no longer give a damn about consequences . not then . not now . because
[176/1000]	i did n't give a shit why he wanted me to be with him . " i ca n't . i have to go . i promised . " " i know , babe . i 'll text
[177/1000]	for a minute or two , they just stared at one another . " you know , " she said finally , " i 'm probably not the most gracious person who ever lived . " " you 're
[178/1000]	he 'd lost an argument with that statement . ' and do you understand that it might not be quite so cool to go after the killer by yourself , do you , sir ? i mean , even
[179/1000]	" it 's a pretty special event . you 're the only people i know who can offer such a gift to a fallen angel . it 's almost as if he 's looking over everyone 's shoulder all the
[180/1000]	for the remainder of our meal , however , we focused on discussing the upcoming gala and the events we were on call to attend . the gala was usually held in a theater room or hall next to
[181/1000]	i looked from mike to kelly . damn , it was hard to keep eye contact , especially if the conversation continued . " we were just joking around . " kelly was still smiling at mike , but
[182/1000]	" there 's nothing to do . do you want to discuss this in your office ? " " that depends . and you do n't think you should have any more to do with the investigation of dr.
[183/1000]	" now then , after breakfast , you 'll take your seat . the rest of us will sit around your table . what about you ? " " i 'm not a big fan of serving coffee ,
[184/1000]	" i do n't understand , " said eddie . " the only way to deal with the two extremes is to keep your emotions under control , " said dimitri . " and to give your true feelings
[185/1000]	he did n't say anything . just crossed the room . i started to follow him , but he closed the door and stopped , leaned forward and whispered something in my ear . i turned slowly and watched him
[186/1000]	" that 's right . " " i 'm not crazy ? " " nope . " " have you ever taken blood from someone in your life ? " " no . " he said
[187/1000]	why did it always feel like death ? i guess i just did n't do a great job keeping my distance . chapter 10 tristan it 's been a week since the attack and lily 's been
[188/1000]	' let 's get my keys out of my bag , ' said ' happy little party , i found a ticket for you and the landlord agreed to let you stay . ' ' how kind of you
[189/1000]	for the past eight thousand years she had tried to ignore the desire to be with these men , and she found herself at one with them for the simple reason that they were no longer interested in her .
[190/1000]	he had seen more than her husband in a lifetime , and he had known a great deal of what it was like to be his wife - he spoke it with a touch of cynicism , his expression questioning
[191/1000]	i ran a hand over my face . " it 's okay . you do n't have to tell me . " i stopped moving and looked around me . no one was looking at us , and
[192/1000]	' the whole world , ' dreadaeleon said . ' everyone ! every body in the whole damned city ! ... ' ' you 've never worked out anything , have you ? ' he asked . '
[193/1000]	i dropped my hands and glanced around , taking in the lush vegetation surrounding me . " so this is how we 're going to do this ? " " yep . " his voice sounded harsh , like
[194/1000]	" right , " i agreed with a nod . " then we 'll just hang out and watch some television , huh ? " mike said , stretching on the couch . " and when my mom
[195/1000]	" but your voice sounds right , " he smiled . " and i know what you 're thinking . you 're thinking i 'm the perfect guy . " " sure . " i nodded , excited to
[196/1000]	" what if he does n't want to , " she argued . " they 're just friends . " " i realize that , " devon said , but there was something pleading in his eyes , a
[197/1000]	" my mother wants us home as soon as possible tonight , " she mumbled under her breath as she moved under the sheet again . " and you do the same , " the warm sleepy voice said
[198/1000]	' yes , sorry i ca n't , but i have some important business to discuss with you . if you really do n't want to <EOS> a chat , now is a good time . i 'll leave you
[199/1000]	" no , " she whispered , " i do n't . " she watched me smile . i had just about won the lottery all over again . chapter 47 not a word was said within
[200/1000]	she looked at me with pure glee before turning to the judge and asking some more questions . " your honor , " mrs. gates called out , interrupting my train of thought . " my wife has a
[201/1000]	at midnight , grace finished her shift at the library , still not certain what had happened to the ghost . before she put her coat on , though , she stopped by the office and pulled herself up with
[202/1000]	chapter ten - " i 'm sorry . " i make my first attempt to help him . he stops me . " i do n't know how this happened . " " how what happened ?
[203/1000]	mike , for his part , felt that he had to be careful , but he turned his attention to the group that was laughing about the meeting going on at the window . of course matt and greg were
[204/1000]	i smiled . " nope . that 's my woman . and i 'm the crazy little guy that bit the hand you were holding . and you 're the crazy little guy that did all that right . i
[205/1000]	she was in a haze . she was losing her mind . she was thinking about sex with rafe . rafe ? she tried to sit up but her body was n't cooperating . she was n't any
[206/1000]	" oh , you 're such a dork , " i said , smacking his arm as he laughed . " what are you doing home so early ? " " are you insane ? " he asked ,
[207/1000]	the others responded and together the group scrambled up . the ship went up through the air . the ship crashed over the first part of the next part . the ground was flat and the flying debris knocked everyone
[208/1000]	" we were fighting when i started the fire , " i said . " he would have been dead by then . " " exactly . but then , you stopped all the fights and you stopped everything
[209/1000]	he had told this story to several other detectives , but his mouth would n't leave his lips . finally , he sputtered , " huh ? what 's that supposed to mean ? " but the police detective was
[210/1000]	even though they were practically engaged now , though he 'd wanted to be with her for the last three weeks , his dick had n't stopped complaining since he 'd dropped her off at her apartment an hour ago
[211/1000]	my fingers shook as we entered the hallway . " now is not the best time to ask , mom . it 's not safe . " " i 'm okay . please , do n't worry . "
[212/1000]	" you are the first person since my father and mother that i know of , " he responds . i wonder if my mother must really like the man because here 's my chance to meet someone more
[213/1000]	" where was she ? " alex asks as he comes up next to me . i frown as we start walking across the room toward the group clustered around the fireplace . " i do n't know -
[214/1000]	' i think we 'd better get moved , ' she said in a strained voice . ' we 're almost here . ' they scrambled into their saddles and rode on out of the valley . the
[215/1000]	" yeah , really , " i say . i was just leaving this for him . " we have to be over at the library twenty minutes before curfew , " he says . he looks very excited
[216/1000]	" you could come . " " i would like that , " she said . " but i understand if you 'd prefer not to . i really appreciate it . i 've missed you . "
[217/1000]	" they 're all fine and fine , " i answered . " so they 're both inside ? " i pressed my fingertips against my lips and then brushed the pink tips against my lips .
[218/1000]	i stare at her , wondering if this is truly the beginning of the end . i can picture those faces now , those eyes pleading with me for answers . " hey , " i say , leaning in
[219/1000]	but not for long . there was no time to waste . i pushed into my brother 's room and stopped a few inches away from his sleeping body . all i saw was the wall , the ceiling
[220/1000]	the older woman finally gave john a half - smile . " oh , you 're going to have enough bruises to show for your troubles , are n't you ? " she said , indicating her arm .
[221/1000]	" you know him ? " " in fact , i know him well . " julia 's mouth fell open and her hand flew to her throat , pulling her scarf over it as if it were
[222/1000]	now he could n't go home . he could n't watch her suffer . he could n't help her when her eyes were closed on them all and she was in a coma . and he could n't help her
[223/1000]	" oh , that was a nice dress , " i said . " come on in now . " we drove through the front door of the house . a smile curved his mouth , but i looked
[224/1000]	" no , i can not afford that sort of trouble . " " do you think there was a man who wanted you dead , captain ? who did that man want you dead ? " in
[225/1000]	" what the hell is up with you , mr. winters , and what make you think you know what you 're doing ? " " i 'm in the right hands when i get my hands on her
[226/1000]	" let 's hope not , " i muttered . " i feel like an idiot . " " if she means something to you or your children ... " there was a brief silence , then he returned
[227/1000]	it ca n't be right . there ai n't no way this is the man i saw in the dream . the boy 's head is too big down there . he ai n't got no teeth . i
[228/1000]	" yeah . " " so i 'm going to help you have my daughter dressed , " said meredith . " yeah . " and he sighed , disappointed . " i 'll bring her out
[229/1000]	he said finally , " i 'm sorry , gwen . i just thought ... " he looked down . " you know - were you going to forgive me forever ? " i nodded and moved a little
[230/1000]	" i want you to turn me into a noc tal is . " his green eyes gleam as he raises blood - red eyebrows at me . i laugh . " no , it 's more like the
[231/1000]	he tried to keep his voice calm , but somehow managed a weak smile . " thanks . the thought was there . " " i 'm beginning to get it . " the grin that spread across her
[232/1000]	he set aside his book . " we may have to take up a new hobby - shopping . " they left his father 's building to walk together along the park . they stopped to rest and take
[233/1000]	" who were you talking to ? " his tone was heavy , suspicious , and she wondered if he was about to make an assault , if that was why his chest was heaving . she could n't
[234/1000]	" hey , you guys , " said jake . " do you mind if we stay here tonight ? by myself ? there 's always a crowd around here . " " take my place , " i
[235/1000]	when he looked slightly worried as well , she sighed . " they 're good people , you know ? i just know it . " " okay , " he smiled softly , wanting to kiss her but
[236/1000]	" maybe not . but right now not only will we look even more ridiculous , but every woman in the store is checking out my hot bod . if i go home with a man who looks like he
[237/1000]	he reached around me , his fingers grasping when he was almost up front . his arm stretched behind me and the tip of his thick - fingered index finger grazed my ass , making me shiver and melt right
[238/1000]	" so we 'll keep the girl ? " scott said . he 'd followed <EOS> before ; that much was undeniable . " oh yeah , sure , " i said , smiling at his bravado . "
[239/1000]	i had heard the stories about the " king " of my friends who met the queen of the unseelie court as she rose from a throne she never would have dared to touch . she was tall and willowy
[240/1000]	" i think we should call in an ambulance shortly , " said an officer . " we 've got ta get going , " said one of the officers . " we 'll need a car out there
[241/1000]	" i 'm not my father . please believe me . " his voice took on that soft tone and i realized it was him . i felt myself becoming increasingly scared . this was so beyond what i had
[242/1000]	" what happened ? " his voice shook . " look , i have an idea that might help you come back ... " " but you ca n't fix the thing . " " not really
[243/1000]	we both smile . i see a slight hint of sadness in nate 's head , but i probably need to kick my brother in the balls a few more times to get him to act the fool he is
[244/1000]	the other man nodded and led the way into the kitchen . one of the other men , george , was already ready to serve them . " have a seat , " he said , motioning toward the table
[245/1000]	" no . never . " she nodded , and her eyes narrowed and she was back to walking at her normal speed . when the house came into view i slowed the car and pulled off the street
[246/1000]	their gazes met for a second , and the look in her eyes told him enough . she did n't want it to be that way . he might also have just made himself a fool , but damn
[247/1000]	he frowned at himself in the mirror . he 'd forgotten this was almost day two , so he needed to get over it . the day was turning out to be a disaster in more ways than one ,
[248/1000]	when she opened the door , simon was standing before her , one hand resting on the doorframe , the other tucked into the pocket of his jeans . " what ... ? " she blinked faster . he
[249/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " i said , pulling away . i 'd never seen james look so somber . " nothing right now . they 're expecting our arrival . we should go . " my
[250/1000]	" are you kidding me ? " he asks , still standing , and then suddenly his lips are on mine again , wet and furious as his tongue pushes past my lips over mine . " i 'm
[251/1000]	an image of me standing there , naked and beautiful in a bathtub filled my mind . " you 're beautiful as ever , " i said . " just as i remember . " " then you
[252/1000]	but when he sat down , he thought , what makes me so different from anyone else in this world ? when he woke it was in the dark , and he could n't hear the buzzing of whatever
[253/1000]	her parents , like all her siblings , had lived long lives in different places , and she was n't naive enough to believe that the absence of their home in los angeles 's suburbs would make it okay so
[254/1000]	" there are several other children who are different than you . " " how many ? " i question . " a thousand , maybe a little more . " he says nothing else , just
[255/1000]	" a very good question . " " they have a beautiful house , but there are these great numbers of houses in the city . " " would you like to see the whole of it ?
[256/1000]	after i 'd hung up with mary jo , i had the idea to call mack . i was n't particularly eager to discuss his mother 's feelings , but the way mary jo talked about mack was so unique
[257/1000]	" this is for you . this will get you through your ordeal . " they both took the boxes . " i have to find a spare pair of briefs for the guys , which is your last
[258/1000]	he was quiet for a while , but the silence had the effect of pulling him out of the deep , dark . after a few moments , while we watched the sun rise from behind dark clouds , he
[259/1000]	" what do you think ? " " hell , yes . " " good , you should think about it . " john pulled a crumpled receipt from the envelope . " here , this is for
[260/1000]	" okay , but do n't start ! " i said hotly . " i should n't have told you about this ! " " yeah sure you should have . you said it was why we only went
[261/1000]	" how does one get enough of you ? " " you . " " and what goes on inside your body ? is it really nothing ? everything and no one ? " he thought about
[262/1000]	her eyes fluttered open . she was awake . it took a few seconds to recognize who stood over her . " oh , my god , what time is it ? " he asked . she blinked
[263/1000]	the little man who was apparently the newest member of the group pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face . " you know his wife and children ? you know their parents ? " grace asked
[264/1000]	" please , be careful . " she lifted her cup and took a sip . " please be careful , daddy . you need to see a doctor . " " you do n't need me to
[265/1000]	the woman answered , " why , welcome to my house ! have a few of your boys do some work while you 're there . in the morning , i 'll take you somewhere else to eat with the
[266/1000]	he pulls out immediately , pushing back inside . the sensation of him thrusting into me , knowing i 'm close , sends ecstasy over me like no other . it feels like he owns me , as if i
[267/1000]	one would think the woman was in a trance , but she was n't . she could do this . she heard his footsteps with un er ring ease . he approached steadily and she felt a surge of resistance
[268/1000]	" it ? me ? what do you mean ? oh , " michael answered , trying to remember what michael had said . " she 's gone somewhere else , she 's not here anymore . i thought i
[269/1000]	" the fact that you just woke up , " she murmured , " makes me think that you like me too . " " i do like you . " the door opened , revealing a plump
[270/1000]	" i think so too , " replied henry , feeling slightly embarrassed by this information . however , he thought his immediate response to the knowledge he was about to deliver to dr. ma ul din was good that
[271/1000]	" but there were so many , " she said , " it was hard to find a clear spot . " " there did n't seem to be one for me , " i said . " i
[272/1000]	" yes , sir . " chris felt an overwhelming urge to please you . " in that case , i am expecting your arrival in a few minutes . we will take you to the vip lounge for
[273/1000]	" so you say . " " you 're gon na have to trust me . now . all will be revealed in due time , but for now you still have to trust me all the way .
[274/1000]	" but you will be their leader . they wo n't follow you if you do n't break your vow . " " when will i find the queen ? " i ask . " very soon ,
[275/1000]	the world was the first place that she had experienced his lips on hers . by chance , nothing had happened , but the memory of his weight so close , her long hair spilling over him , his
[276/1000]	he 'd kissed her there on the bed . but that was right . nothing had moved him as much here as her head upon his shoulder . a strange thought - how much more he wanted her in his
[277/1000]	" oh , now that i remember , " he said softly . " but once i do it , i must remember who 's in charge . " her hand slipped out of his as she turned to leave
[278/1000]	" yes , " i admitted . as much as i hated to admit it , i did love the idea of spending my life with him . i 'd have a whole new wardrobe in just two months ,
[279/1000]	" let 's go meet her , " sam says dismissively , and he does n't wait for an answer . i do n't blame him , that bitch . she 's like a plague , a virus . this
[280/1000]	" but i was sure that i had done it . you all left me for a while . i was scared , and i asked myself why i had gone there . and i figured that you were all
[281/1000]	i 'd know that voice anywhere . it was my father 's , because i would've never recognized him without an ounce of money , even if we had n't been in the same bar for twenty - four hours
[282/1000]	" is n't there supposed to be a rule that , when a member of the team is compromised , their power rests on security ? " john frowned at the memory . " well , we get
[283/1000]	" you 're a strange little thing , are n't you ? " he grinned . " you better believe it . " this was good . the things he said - what he wanted from me -
[284/1000]	he nodded and smiled . " oh , yes , those big blue eyes , her perfect teeth . " his head swiveled to the side as if he felt something he wanted to say . " wait here
[285/1000]	all of this could be dealt with later until he could get to a healing pool . that night , while she got in the shower , he called his sister . still , she <EOS> ... wanted to
[286/1000]	" my advice is to just quit being a dumbass and go find the one who 's supposed to have the answers , " alex said , pulling at his tie a little . the brothers stared into each
[287/1000]	she smiled and reached her hand for him . " okay , a deal . " * * * i rolled out of bed and rolled out of bed , making sure a large condom was in case
[288/1000]	' with a heart like yours , you 'll not waste time , ' said his commander . ' exactly . but my heart is n't in the middle of some strange army of bandits , gentlemen ! '
[289/1000]	" i ca n't , " nick mumbled . he pulled his shoulders back and walked out of the bathroom . it had felt so good . it had burned . there had been all his fingers and toes in
[290/1000]	we passed the table he 'd been sitting at , and i heard his low gasp as i passed , turned back , and looked pointedly at him . i was n't going to respond . i knew
[291/1000]	but one thing was for certain : by the middle of the night , he had been kidnapped . kidnapped by a black wolf . i turned off the lamp and went down the hall to my old bedroom
[292/1000]	my son would go next : he was nine and i was six and we 'd played house for the past four years . since then i 've been a good father to him and a good husband , and
[293/1000]	she shifted back down on the bed so she could meet his gaze completely . then , she said , " yes . " she closed her eyes and arched her back one more time , her br *
[294/1000]	" i have my own way of making a living , " he 'd answered quietly , with a slight laugh . i was a bit stunned . i had never even heard of a man handling the kind
[295/1000]	her lips parted in surprise , and they moved as he sank inside her . she gasped , a little more her usual breathy sound , and her hands came up in his hair . pleasure and pain and
[296/1000]	" when you left the room at eight , your footsteps were heard by some of the girls . while i was busy watching you , you were doing the most thing i had ever seen a woman do :
[297/1000]	" hi , daddy , " he greeted , all chipper , eager , his old , broken voice . how the past few days with his father had changed him , changed his life for the better , but
[298/1000]	the doctor paused before he spoke . " we know which organ you 're in and what specifically you 're suffering from in that region . one organ , one organ ? " " yes , " she said
[299/1000]	she pulled back . " do you like them too much ? they 're not enough to take your mind off the fact that you ca n't take a bath in your entire life . " " what ?
[300/1000]	" why do you think they would do that ? " " i do n't know . they could have a list of people who were trying to sabotage the company , or because of that he may have
[301/1000]	2 but i got you pregnant 2 and only you 2 but only you could have 2 but you knew 2 i 'd wanted you then 2 he was n't yours 2 but you
[302/1000]	" you know , " she said , " that i may have been a little rough with you in the elevator and out of my apartment . " of course she had been . it was a true
[303/1000]	you get what you paid for . we , as mortals , were going to lose our minds soon enough . " i want to leave her ! " one of the vampires cried . " i want to
[304/1000]	" thank you , alex , " i replied with a sigh . i turned and continued to work on the tablet . i 'd always been a bit fascinated by this little art project that i did . the
[305/1000]	" no ! no . it could n't be ! she 's out there somewhere . she knew what was going to happen ! " he does n't believe me , maybe he does n't care . but i
[306/1000]	she could n't believe what i was saying . i just wanted to feel like we were the same person , and then fall in love with him with the one person i thought i 'd never see again .
[307/1000]	" just ... keep it moving . " i nodded my understanding . i reached in and grabbed the first box and was surprised to feel the cool metal under my fingers . this was why i would n't
[308/1000]	i took a deep breath and forced myself to be calm , to remember what had happened . " when you told me the truth , i thought you had fallen for one of my friends or had fallen
[309/1000]	she shook her head . " that 's not it . what if you are ? what if i 'm afraid to meet the monster too ? " " the thing is i think of you what i want
[310/1000]	i sit down across from her as we wait in line . " why did they take all this ... " i pause . she 's looking at me , confused . " why did n't we tell
[311/1000]	" it was nice of you to come inside . " " whatever . i just hope that i 'm not wrong about that . " " well , i 'll not be here forever . " i
[312/1000]	" is this supposed to make us stay here just to watch them fight ? " he said . i shook my head and pointed to mr. crepsley . " if you leave , you can stand here or
[313/1000]	" wait ' til you hear it , " he muttered . her stomach growled loudly , and she looked at him , surprised . " are you going to eat ? " he nodded . something
[314/1000]	" i 'm happy , " she whispered , wanting to forget the time that had gone by . all she could focus on was kissing him and the sweetness of his kisses against her skin . " i
[315/1000]	" it 's not something they might tell over the phone , " he said . " they 'll probably send someone else to take your calls when they show up . " " if they are , it
[316/1000]	chapter nineteen " ah ! " " just a minute . how did you do that thing with the lights ? i like it . " " i would say you 're doing fine . " cole
[317/1000]	" can you drive ? " he nodded . " good , " i said . " we should find a place to hide out for the night until morning . maybe some road . " "
[318/1000]	" now , wait a minute . do n't go anywhere <EOS> ' the love your grandfather is getting your slippers . nothing . tell me . " " that 's you , " i got drunk .
[319/1000]	" this is it , i thought . " it did n't sound like it was any place . it was a shack made from dark wood , a bare bulb hanging from the dark ceiling . " you
[320/1000]	" good . " he smiled pleasantly . " sit down , lady . your servant needs some tea with the food . " i did n't sit , but i did sit . " oh , that
[321/1000]	" nothing is out of place . i 'm just a little tired because we spent the night together . if i had known you lived downstairs , i would have waited for you . " " i have
[322/1000]	" i was n't planning on any such thing . " " that 's not what i heard . " " are you telling me you were n't listening this morning ? " " i was as

[324/1000]	" yes , of course , " emily answered , her voice trembling . what sort of monster could have hurt her sisters with this man ? her mother - in - law would be so upset that emily had
[325/1000]	" hello , " said the secretary coolly . philip was a little uncomfortable still , since the assistant minister of the interior had not mentioned the arrival of a new guest . " would you care to
[326/1000]	" look there again , " luke directed , turning his eyes onto the screen . " yeah , yeah , okay , i can see that . " " okay ... let me see . "
[327/1000]	" you 're in a hurry to go , " he commented , clearly not looking for an argument . " i want to be on my own , " aundy said , taking a step away from him
[328/1000]	" well , your point is ... " " what ? no ! let me finish . i am tired . why do you keep interrupting me ? ! " " because you really do n't like how
[329/1000]	" they 're at the temple of the dawn ? " garion wondered . " it 's just for the guests , garion , " belgarath replied , " after the wedding ceremony starts . " the party
[330/1000]	" your sister - in - law calls it one thing . your mother - in - law calls it one thing . i would n't be surprised if she calls the whole town one thing . she 's made
[331/1000]	" sorry . " i paused . " i remember the day after the break - up . " " how did he ask you for your ring ? and did you tell him you found it in your
[332/1000]	" yeah . you need a ride ? " she laughed . " yeah , why not ? " * * * * with an effort , she jerked her head toward the house . "
[333/1000]	" yeah , you mean to say - " " the police think we do n't know yet , " he said . and then , with a slight shrug , they changed the subject . <EOS> and
[334/1000]	" he saved me before he died . he would have died to save me . " " do you really believe that ? " julia bit her lip and held her hands , like she was scared
[335/1000]	" what ? " she almost screeched . i pointed to myself in the mirror . " i have a huge hump in <EOS> a ring . i got in a bra . and i 'll make sure that
[336/1000]	we both stood up and grabbed our stuff , heading out the door . her head was down low , so i knew she was probably avoiding looking up at me . i looked down at her ; her
[337/1000]	" that 's real , " i said . and i had good reason to believe this morning when mrs. white and mr. ra gu sa were making the same complaints about my little house - pet . when i
[338/1000]	the man said , " you do n't need to stay for anything . " the woman said , " we have to see the president for yourself . " the man said , " who is he
[339/1000]	she turned , just a bit , and smiled at him . she touched his face gently . " you 're not alone , " she said . " not here . " she ran her fingers through his
[340/1000]	not that the old man really cared if he lived or died in the short time allotted him . the fact that the man in the wheelchair had not tried to use his eyes to watch him gave his intentions
[341/1000]	" that is a good thing , " i say , " because i 'm not going . " " well , i , um ... had kind of a good idea to see if you were interested in
[342/1000]	" we are together , that is all i can say . thank you . " " thank you . " he looked at her and almost lost his resolve by the time he was walking out the door
[343/1000]	his hands slid around to my bottom and he pulled me close . i tipped my head back and looked into his eyes . " you better get those pictures tonight , " i whispered , my eyes
[344/1000]	" maybe i 'm just bored , " charlie offered , not meaning to sound so honest . " good , " charlie said . " good . " he nodded , suddenly more interested than ever in hearing
[345/1000]	" oh , no you do n't . you might have to fight against the police in here if you think i 'm going to do that . no more lies . " " i 'm sorry for your
[346/1000]	" you can not do that , " he said , " when i am not even the one you have chosen ? i must say it is a truly unusual statement , especially given what i have just revealed
[347/1000]	i feel every moment of it . the pain of losing you , my own son , our children . i could n't continue , i lay back in the seat and watched the road . his eyes were
[348/1000]	he kept his voice low but commanding , " you 've been with , i do n't have to remind you - " she pressed her lips together and he knew she liked something said in that way he
[349/1000]	" and that 's even more dangerous than meeting us in the woods ! " said chello in a loud voice as he stood beside torus at the front of the group <EOS> from the other . he seemed to
[350/1000]	it was a small price to pay for her trust and love . still , he was n't going to give it up easily . " all right , " he said . " come with me . "
[351/1000]	" would you go on for a few and back me up ? " " you might want to go on for a while , hon . i ca n't begin to imagine what i 'll be doing next
[352/1000]	" really ? " " good . it means i ca n't fire her yet . " i frowned . " wait a minute . what ? " " what ? that no , you ca n't
[353/1000]	i do n't realize exactly how much time passes until someone hands me a plastic cup of milk . while the rest of the girls and i are here under water , i finally catch sight of my dead mother
[354/1000]	" i am looking forward to meeting this gabriel . if he is as devoted to you as i was , he would n't have to spend his entire summer going around and introducing new students to my teachers .
[355/1000]	" i am . " " i will hold you to that . " " then let me go . " " i ca n't , " he whispers , his eyes searching mine . they take
[356/1000]	" they want to know what happened . all of you . " we all crowded into the car and headed towards her house . she drove us past the store where i would have been playing when i
[357/1000]	if i had n't taken his name , would i be capable ? would i , at this point , even listen to it now ? " jack will be sleeping too , " she said . "
[358/1000]	but that 's not right , cassie thought . it 's not right or fair ; it 's crazy and it 's dangerous and it 's evil , but it 's true . something heavy pressed down on her
[359/1000]	i do n't intend to do anything to cause a riot , but there 's something in his tone that tells me he 's done something - probably something with the people who are supposed to be protecting her .
[360/1000]	' just a picture , ' he said , ' that would n't hurt anyone . ' ' it hurt . can i use it ? ' ' you can borrow it , if it helps . '
[361/1000]	on her way back she heard a man say to her , " i did not know you were a hunter ! " anya smiled and looked back at the man . " i 'm a good looking girl
[362/1000]	" i am here for you , ethan . " he glanced at john , then returned his eyes back to me . " if it is at all possible for you to forgive me - " i
[363/1000]	" hi , girls , " julia said as she looked over at molly and danny . it was a quiet evening . molly giggled when she greeted julia , " hello . " " oh hi ,
[364/1000]	" i like to drive . " " me too , " she says , turning back to the road . it 's been twenty years , but i do n't hear anything between us in this relationship
[365/1000]	" yes , " she said tightly . " it was an honor . " he felt himself blush , though it was n't from a cold sweat . he touched the lump of dirt where his brother had
[366/1000]	her eyes widen and she pushes a hand through her choppy hair . " get in . " i lower my fists at my side and slowly climb in the car . " you too , "
[367/1000]	he glanced at her with a smile . " i 'd have a lot more fun chasing you , darling . i always know where you are . " yeah , right . everyone always says the same thing
[368/1000]	" have i ever lied to you ? " he shrugged . i glared at him . " i 'm not your daughter . you take my word for it . " he chuckled , but it
[369/1000]	" when was that ? " demanded the king . " last night ? " " about a week ago , " said lo . " you had a month ? " " that 's right ,
[370/1000]	" i think mine is the same - i 'm usually less than normal . " " well , my day ended just about the same , " grace said . " you do n't have a normal
[371/1000]	" well , i might be able to come up with another deal . " and wait a minute ... how could she afford the money to buy these clothes ? " where would you like to buy
[372/1000]	" are n't you sure ? " " i 'm sure . " " well , okay then , " eddie said . " but are you going to go all hero bullshit on me ? "
[373/1000]	" it was always hard to get back up for <EOS> - eating cake that i went out , " i did n't have any friends and i decided to marry adam . that got me to fall off a
[374/1000]	this is what i want . to be free of the responsibility of the men i care about like they 're my brothers , like they are my own family . life is good . that 's what life would
[375/1000]	" i 've got an appointment for lunch in the morning , " he said without even thinking . " i 'll call you when i 'm home . " the next day he dialed her number and waited
[376/1000]	" i guess you 'd call it that , yeah , " i said , trying to sound normal . " i wish we had some time , " he said quietly . " after - " "
[377/1000]	that 's a good one . in the interest of keeping myself in good condition , i have not filled out . the scars that they will leave to me in the end are not the only thing i have
[378/1000]	the house was quiet when she opened it . without a sound , she headed into her bathroom on her way to the kitchen to look for him . maybe he was the one who took the stairs .
[379/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " i mean i do n't understand what is going on . i 've only been to you once , but somehow you know me on a personal level just by looking
[380/1000]	" i have n't really finished my studies yet . " his parents were dead - on , since his father worked four years to get out of yale and was now the dean of the university of maryland ,
[381/1000]	' no . they 're being kept in one of my warehouse apartments . they said they need a place to sleep tomorrow . ' ' but what about a prison holiday . that 'd make what you were
[382/1000]	he looked at me with such sadness and despair . " why ? " i turned away , unable to face him when i sensed his pain . he was my only hope now , my only friend .
[383/1000]	he does n't know that i had no idea the man was there , but he still somehow seems to know . chapter seven two days later the two old men are waiting in an old oak tree
[384/1000]	" we 're already on the ground after that little stunt . " her smile never wavered from her face . " what ? do n't tell me you do n't know that much about these people already ? "
[385/1000]	i 'd gotten it by watching me with her boyfriend . when i 'd made up my mind as some sort of test to discover her secret , all i had to do was ask her what i should expect
[386/1000]	' you 're coming with ? ' ' we are , mr bun ger , ' said cuddy , and then , on a sudden realisation as one man does when he 's been told he is in in
[387/1000]	" good , " he says , " and now get some rest , and in the morning you need a wake - up call . got something i need to tell you . " she waves her hand
[388/1000]	i shook my head . " what ? " " you told my friends about tonight ... about the carnival , " she said . " they know who the dead guy is . " i started to
[389/1000]	" he asked you to come down here , did n't he ? " " yes . " " so should n't we stop him ? " " i do n't think he wants a fight .
[390/1000]	" why have you been here ? " " i realized that i could go a couple of weeks without seeing you all <EOS> with the old stuff you 're in all the night , and i was right
[391/1000]	" oh , the poor thing is upset . i have n't seen my friend in so long , but look at her . " rachel looked down , unable to see the image of their small child 's
[392/1000]	" hey there . you looking for someone ? " i turned around . jared stood at the top of the walk , smiling down at me . " hey . " " oh hi . what
[393/1000]	as i went to the sink to clean the salt out of the bowl of soap , i was glad to hear the front door open and close . " i hope this is not going to be a disaster
[394/1000]	' but the man who did the killing ? how did he get away with that ? ' ' there is no explanation , sir . we do not really know , but nothing to worry about - i
[395/1000]	" how 'd you know i was looking for you ? " i asked . he walked over to me slowly . " i 'm not used to you staying up past three in the morning . who would
[396/1000]	" the good news , " i said as he lifted his shirt , " was it would n't have anything to do with me , now that i 've had another shot at some of you . i do
[397/1000]	" with my head up where it ai n't meant to be ? " he replied , looking mildly puzzled and amused at the same time . the two of them walked back toward where peter 's jeep sat
[398/1000]	that made me feel better . at least , i thought that it did . i was actually a little relieved that jack always trusted me enough to handle this kind of crisis . i guess i deserved it after
[399/1000]	i said something about it . it might feel weird to be looking at a body , but i figured i 'd keep a record . i got up from the table and hurried out . the stairs were
[400/1000]	" we do n't get it . was it like when you were a child ? " rachel asked . " yeah , kind of . i liked a lot less if i was in kindergarten instead of this
[401/1000]	no answer . i glanced away to read the window . a small glimmer of light beckoned upon the lawn , indicating that people sat there . i pushed through . one more - no , a third : a
[402/1000]	" you were n't the one that called the cops , " he said . " i was , and i 'm still ... <EOS> - " my fingers turned it , and i just stared at the big -
[403/1000]	" you 're going to be a lot easier to handle if you come here and keep your mouth shut . but that 's not a good idea . " " oh , and the name is ? "
[404/1000]	" and now we have to watch ? " " if we do , she 'll cut off our legs . " " she 's so cold ! " " is that so hard for you ?
[405/1000]	at first it did not react . they then started to feel their breath ; everything was alive again , everything was alive again . people became less as they all moved into the atmosphere of the sphere and began
[406/1000]	i grinned . " would you like some ? " i asked . " go talk to your friend downstairs . do you want anything else ? " " no , thanks . i think i 'm good
[407/1000]	" all right ... well , a part of me hates the idea , but she does n't like me either . " i shrug . " do n't worry . i 'll teach them . i know which
[408/1000]	and those were n't nearly as many as he 'd pictured . but he was n't done staring at her . what was her name ? " lily . " her eyes widened , then widened , and
[409/1000]	" no , you were different . you wanted me . now he 's mine , and he 's mine . " " he 's mine ? " the words came out like a scream . fear exploded behind
[410/1000]	i nod and look back at his work . i do n't know what to say . there 's just a lot to process in the moment . " okay . well , i have to go . you both
[411/1000]	" the man you saw in that cage in london , there , " he said , pointing at the cell in the centre of the courtyard , " the man with the dark eyes is the one who had
[412/1000]	" no , " i say again , just to be sure she does n't freak out . still nothing but a weird look . i step forward and take her hand to lead her back to the
[413/1000]	she paused , then slid her left hand to his neck . that 's when he noticed her gaze and the way the lamplight glinted on her hair . the moment passed in a flash : her hand was on
[414/1000]	she was gone . it was only after the paramedics got into his truck and he knew she 'd be okay that he decided to take her home in bed . because he cared . which did n't change
[415/1000]	i shook my head , not exactly sure what was happening here , with my friends . my first thought was that my mom had actually just died . then i ran back up the stairs , jumped the first
[416/1000]	i turned my head away . " i know you , " he said . his fingertips traced my cheek , my temple , my nostrils , my lips . " you 're cute when you cry - your
[417/1000]	" oh , you came over , " he rasped . she swallowed hard . " yes . " he brushed the backs of his fingers down her cheek . " i feel so damned sexy when i
[418/1000]	" no , she 's your mother . is n't that right ? " her mother blinked . " is that it ? that 's it now ? " " that 's it . " her mother
[419/1000]	" did you say something , ma bo ? " said ru mble fl in . " indeed , my dear man day ala , i did , " replied ru mble fl in sadly . " i have
[420/1000]	" we need to find out the truth about him , " said tim , sounding anxious . " he could have killed her . " " she has a heart problem . she 's been with the mic
[421/1000]	" good , " he said . " now stop wasting time and come with me , please . " i followed him in the open doorway . he swept a sweep of his arm around the room ,
[422/1000]	" are you kidding me ? how stupid am i ? " with a laugh that echoed around the room , olivia stood and walked over to where the door led outside . inside , the entire building was lit
[423/1000]	i was just leaving him sitting alone at the bar . i had n't felt like i needed to talk to him . was he going to tell me they all had to give up and stay together ? maybe
[424/1000]	it makes no difference if she 's a human being . it never does . she says , " do n't you want to know why i said yes to you ? " i do n't know if
[425/1000]	" i 've been driving around today and got a feeling we may have found him by now . you still need some more information ? " " yes , but at this point the only thing i can
[426/1000]	' i 'm sorry , ' i said . ' i really am . but i have to be somewhere . ' ' and they say you 're an old lady , ' he said , his voice thick
[427/1000]	i shook my head . " it 's not about me . this whole school is my life , and i do n't want a good screw up . i choose to be normal people . " my eyes
[428/1000]	" i 'll speak to her . if you want to get out of here , then sure . i suppose , " she said lamely . he knew she 'd be happy to move on . he could n't
[429/1000]	" oh no ! do n't you dare go there . " tears of grief , remorse , pain , anger , and frustration formed in my eyes , but i forced them back . i could only cry until
[430/1000]	" my uncle ? " " that 's what he told dad . he thought you 'd be grateful about him . " " why , no . i 'm not . " she tried to blink her
[431/1000]	" not exactly , " i admit . " what does that mean ? " " well , it means it means i do n't think you actually love me . " he smiles at me ,
[432/1000]	his thumb wiped another bead of sweat off the side of my cheek . " i know you have a good reason , a real one , but no matter what you have to go through to bring him back
[433/1000]	i told the guy to wait and then went with him to the front door , where i grabbed his hand and let him pull me back . he let go after a second or two and said .
[434/1000]	" he is not here , " he replies . he shakes his head . " because if he was , he would n't be here . " he smiles again and it is wide and boyish . " he
[435/1000]	" in the long run , i think you have , " claire told her flatly . " you had no choice . " " i did n't have much choice , " caroline repeated . " once those
[436/1000]	" maybe , " he said in a flat voice . " something we can work on on . " chapter twenty - six " i have something you need to take care of , " michael said
[437/1000]	" i have a plan . " " a plan ? " but he knew what this plan was . " yes . " he stepped forward and was again close enough for her to smell his aftershave
[438/1000]	he gave another dismissive shrug . " you are good for something . besides what would you do without me , you should go with mom , not me . " " hey ! do n't talk that way
[439/1000]	" yeah , that 's the point . " she took a swig from her diet coke , her expression tight and concerned . " i do n't think he 'll be able to resist me even if i 'm
[440/1000]	he took us over to the hotel in the city center , stopping on the way for coffee and a good view of the water , on the way home . i had never been here before . i
[441/1000]	the girl had to be ten years old and seemed innocent enough . the way her dress molded to her curves made me feel ashamed because that was exactly how i liked her . she was a part of me
[442/1000]	not that she would ever allow him to take her there again . the thought had n't entered her mind until they began to move . she barely remembered how to get along with the new person the dragon
[443/1000]	" how do you know if you do n't ? are you some sort of psychic ? " he was looking at me , deep into my eyes . " i 'm an alpha female , " he said
[444/1000]	" the new kid in her school , " he said . " she 's five . " " she had homework on her lap , " the old woman replied . " i did n't see her writing
[445/1000]	" sure , " he said . but he said nothing further . after the day and evening , by the time she finished eating , she was feeling better . " so , tell the truth , is
[446/1000]	" ah , yes . i see . you brought your car . do you want to go home or get the rest of the day off because it 's important to you ? " " i ca n't
[447/1000]	he turned to my roommate and said something to him while looking at me with the most intense look imaginable . in response , i pushed back against him like a hungry tigress , demanding he put me down .
[448/1000]	" i 'm sorry ? " he asked , unable to be bothered to conceal his shock . his vision filled with images , but the words did n't make sense . it all just went away but only because
[449/1000]	" do you plan to fight me ? " she accused , crossing her arms over her chest . a muscle in his jaw jumped . " this is different . " " whose fault is it ?
[450/1000]	" why ? you look beautiful , " he said , brushing his hands down my bare arms . he straightened , running a possessive hand lightly down my back to my hip . " you 're in no man
[451/1000]	" oh . i figured it out and i 'm not changing my mind . " " you might not , but you might be considering that . at this point , you do n't need to get your
[452/1000]	" i miss you too . " i lean down and kiss him softly . " your parents - well , they 're still talking about it , i 'm sure . " " oh , mom and dad
[453/1000]	" yes . " " it 's not like <EOS> and the ability to read . i should n't do it again . " a look of disgust " and i 'm not the greatest mother ...
[454/1000]	" yes , i would and you 're not going to ruin my day , are you ? " " well , that depends . " the voice echoed under the water , making her jump . " what
[455/1000]	" i like that , " i whispered against his lips . " same here , " he muttered into mine and pressed into me again . then he took me there , his hands moving to cup
[456/1000]	" then i 'm here to see if you 'd prefer me to stay , " he said quietly . " you 'll stay , " she breathed . " do what you have to do . i have
[457/1000]	" no , i did n't want to do that . i was a jerk last night though . i 'm sorry , jack ! " emma babbled , fumbling around for something to say . " you 're
[458/1000]	" no , i - i do n't think so . " " i thought as much . do you really not remember anything , or ca n't know anything ? " " not really . except that
[459/1000]	" oh really ? " " uh - huh . " " well , if the old bastard wo n't have you , i 'm going to have you instead . i 'm going to do it once
[460/1000]	he tried the elevator again and it did , climbing smoothly to the third floor . the lobby was quiet with only a few people in the lobby . " hey " - jackson stepped in front of
[461/1000]	the two men watched the new man carefully as he turned sideways in a slow loop . <EOS> and rotated again in turn , each time in the same fashion , until he turned back and they could see his
[462/1000]	" how ? " i asked as we walked . he laughed . " he used to drink all the time . he did n't think i knew ; my mom told me not to push , but he
[463/1000]	" what 's that ? " he asked . i touched his arm . " it could be a rat . " he turned to look at me . " in the old days the rats would be
[464/1000]	" that 's a good idea . " " yeah , it is , " i agreed , rubbing my finger along the inside of her wrist again . we stared at each other for a moment and
[465/1000]	chapter 9 the dream ended - a blue haze took over and it turned out to be dawn . luke walked up the stairs to his cabin a little after six in the morning . he 'd pulled
[466/1000]	all i know is that for weeks on end i was sleeping in my bed with this one . i actually liked the thought of being in it alone . so when she left the ranch i had to go
[467/1000]	no shit . " what is it ? " he was silent . then he said softly , " you could take this away from me , cassie . " i had no clue what he
[468/1000]	" what could have happened to it ? " kate asked after kate had returned with the cups and saucers , and a couple more . " well , " kate continued without looking up . " this late
[469/1000]	the girl laughed . " ' when someone looks at me like that it 's a pity that i like people . ' " " do it every day , " said lucy . " no one cares who
[470/1000]	" i can do a hell of a lot of things without being able to fly , but flying is <EOS> f a little more self - " " i ca n't even kiss for real . "
[471/1000]	" i told you there would be more of what ? " " this . i knew we should n't have done that . " he walked over and picked up her coffee cup from beside the bed
[472/1000]	" what did you tell me to keep the whole thing from me ? " the question sounded almost accusatory . " that the baby was supposed to be here . you said you were going to see him
[473/1000]	" it 's perfect on the inside . you 're perfect in the center . it 's made for the world . " he kissed her again , his lips sliding to hers for a second , sliding away to
[474/1000]	" thanks , guys . it was too soon , but if they ever stop being so friendly with us . " " come on , " the guy with the spiky blonde hair said . he had on
[475/1000]	" that is why it is difficult to give you our location . you will have to rely on me to confirm that . " " i 'm not going to come that close , " said the young
[476/1000]	there was another short silence and then he made his entrance . the entire school watched as the guy in a blue sweatshirt came down the stairs and out onto the main floor . he was carrying a long piece
[477/1000]	" can you believe it ? " i asked . " we 've been sitting here for almost two minutes already . when would i need to do his job at all ? " " why do you ask
[478/1000]	" i told you it would be interesting , " he said . " now , stop talking . " the man was silent and tried hard not to look as if he 'd just noticed his sister for
[479/1000]	" hi . i 'm samantha , " she said shyly , watching me warily . " are you samantha ? " i laughed . " why , sam . i am right here with you . "
[480/1000]	" that 's right , so we have to make her suffer , but do n't be shy , " lily advised the witch , her voice husky but her words gentle . " you 're wise to keep
[481/1000]	chapter 26 i held a glass of iced tea along with a bottle of vodka . " i do n't remember . " i was trying to eat something - i could tell i was hungry - though
[482/1000]	" this way to the stairs , " she said , but that was still said , not asked . i wondered what we 'd find when we reached the lower levels . but we did n't have long
[483/1000]	" what is it , dear ? " said mrs bra mpton , picking up the papers . caroline sniffed a bit . " do n't you think this is disgusting , darling ? the very idea of the
[484/1000]	there was a good deal of confusion in his blue eyes when he finally answered the question . " um ... about the old couple at the mall , what do you think happened , a little bit . ?
[485/1000]	" oh . my god , thank you . " she tried to turn away <EOS> f . for going ; the thought of all , the memory of those ones , the next to some memories , but
[486/1000]	the new guard went into the room and told them to follow him to the meeting point . everyone followed him over by the central staircase , where he made a call on his cell . soon they were all
[487/1000]	" how many times should i call you ? " " in that case , " richard continued , " we should have some work done today . " " but the trial is just two days away
[488/1000]	his eyes were locked tightly on hers , and his lips were thin and a hint of a smile played about his lips , as if it was n't quite certain how to greet her . " no , no
[489/1000]	" right . oh , the old lady she saw ? " " yeah . " my stomach clenched with nerves as i told michael everything . " i need the money . " " so are
[490/1000]	" we did , " he said softly . she looked down , her forehead pressing to the wood , and she laughed again , a full , high , joyous roar . tears shimmered in her eyes ,
[491/1000]	the thought of turning him against her was appalling , but could n't imagine how to avoid it . she needed to tell him that she knew , knew he had the power to change her life and protect her
[492/1000]	it occurs to me that , even though my father is dying , he is still still alive . and that that 's something i want to know about . chapter twelve the first thing i recall when
[493/1000]	" it was a couple of weeks ago . he needed help with another project , and he was busy . it would have done no harm . " " he saw a woman in her forties ? "
[494/1000]	" did n't know it was like that , " the man muttered . his arm tightened more , and i knew he was struggling to keep me steady . the man did n't need much encouragement from me
[495/1000]	" then that 's all right . " his eyes flashed back and forth between the two of us , waiting for my answer . " whatever you can and would give me . i 'll do my best to
[496/1000]	i pull myself over to his side of the bed and straddle him , still straddling him . my hair has come loose from its twist , hanging down my back . it 's hard to fight the desire to
[497/1000]	he cleared his throat , stood up , and left . i thought he could n't possibly look any more surprised when he walked away . i could n't help it since it was the most unexpected thing i 'd
[498/1000]	no , it turned out , he would n't be one of the crazy tourists , that he had to stay on the island . but he would be here , on the island , like this . in this
[499/1000]	" does it ? " " yeah , and it 's totally making me wish i was inside her . and i 'm more than ready to do how you just described , i 'm so f *
[500/1000]	" is that a challenge ? " " no . " he leaned against a wall as he eyed her . " of course not , it will be to your benefit to have the opportunity to have a
[501/1000]	" oh , you 're with your parents now ? " he said after a moment . " yes . " the look he gave her was more pensive , less sure . " so , you left
[502/1000]	he did n't have a solution to what was wrong with the vampire queen , when something told him vampire - hunters were n't as easily fixed as they claimed to be . he knew for a fact that she
[503/1000]	" good to know . " her frown deepened , and her eyes shifted up to the ceiling . " do you think he 's still hunting us ? " her question stopped alex in his tracks . just
[504/1000]	" i do n't know , " i lied , trying to shake off a chill . i put my hand on his shoulder , " it probably does n't matter , though . " his eyes turned to
[505/1000]	" will i have to live all my life in this prison ? " " only a few other prisoners have been released , " de stro said , his voice emotionless . " most of your prisoners will
[506/1000]	" what about our dad ? " hanna blurted suddenly . hanna looked down . " i do n't know . i mean , i 'll never see him again . " ezra stared . " are you
[507/1000]	" have you seen anything unusual last night , mr. thompson ? " mr. thompson 's voice boomed through the phone line . " not really , " i whispered . " it sounded like a girl yelled
[508/1000]	" i know him . he 's not here , but ... he 'll be back . for the sake of the bar , he deserves a good night 's rest . " " maybe this was n't the
[509/1000]	his fingers tightened even further , but then he kissed her . a deep , wet kiss that took all of her away , and this time , did n't stop . he never stopped . his hands
[510/1000]	then she noticed the smile on his lips . it was n't an easy smile , but she felt comforted looking at it . she hugged him tightly , almost fearfully . chapter 9 she glanced up and
[511/1000]	this was not a new idea to my grandmother . the old woman stepped back while the three boys looked at me expectantly . this was not a time for smiling and being kind , but i could n't
[512/1000]	<EOS> a moment later , they opened their eyes . " we ... fought it . " " the pain woke you . " " i hate to think how many times i 've tried to kick it
[513/1000]	" i 've seen a lot of his work ... he 's a talented carpenter , and in a house like this you could get a little more work than a family . " " yeah , i know
[514/1000]	what would have happened after that , in the course of my affair with ethan ? we 'd both still be here . not like those years ago ? " thanks for the drink . " i turned to
[515/1000]	she raised her eyebrows . " uh , okay . " " you 're not going to be happy living in another city , are you ? " " uh - huh . " " nothing to
[516/1000]	james looked at him . " i 'll go get a cup of coffee and see what 's going on . " " i 'll do the same . " " you know , " elijah said ,
[517/1000]	" come back with it . " " it 's too dangerous , " i said . " stay here . " " jack ! " " that 's a big f * * king mistake .
[518/1000]	the boy finally spoke . " so , is there anything i can do for you , uncle monty ? " his gaze roamed in circles across the room like he was trying to gather everything together , finding everything
[519/1000]	" that 's not much help against him . why not just let him die ? if all the other guards get to guard this place after me , no one will know about any of this . "
[520/1000]	her cheeks grew warm . " oh , of course . i 'm sorry . " she smiled , and that was the awkward part . " let me introduce you to ... mrs. du mont . "
[521/1000]	your husband . that 's very easy to say , " said mr. utter son . " i 'm afraid so , that 's what i meant , " returned the lawyer of that era . the next moment
[522/1000]	" it 's worth a try , " he said . " let me take him back inside before i let the police . " the two men were standing in the lobby , close enough that she could
[523/1000]	" i hope you 're right , " the old man said . " i am . " " then you do n't understand . he 's not going to stay buried here . we have an obligation
[524/1000]	he nodded as if he 'd heard every bit , and then turned to face her . " well , i 'm glad you found a way , " he said . " the girl is no liar . i
[525/1000]	i sit back and watch as a few couples laugh and talk . they 're surrounded by people waiting to be turned their lives over to their new husbands . i know they want to raise their children while they
[526/1000]	" this boy is a fool , he knows it but god help me , " thought miles as he tried to gather his thoughts . " and i am going to have to , but i 'm going
[527/1000]	' ' sc use me , sir , '' murmurs the corporal , and pulls the captain 's sword out , holding it up for all to see . ' ' there will be no fighting , nobby ,
[528/1000]	" well , " said gregor . " maybe you do n't want to come . " it struck him as odd to think ares might be glad to go . " maybe i do not want to go
[529/1000]	' it is not yet three , and there is a great danger the king 's plans may be misinterpreted . i 'll see the dragon with you and tell her , but let 's not delay too long .
[530/1000]	" well , you 're right , " he agreed . " now it 's <EOS> ... and not to get another that 's going from boredom ... oh , not to get ready to get busy on track ,
[531/1000]	" i 'll tell you what , " mary said , ignoring mary and the other guests , " you drive the girls back to the house . " she stood up and grabbed her purse , " i 'll
[532/1000]	" a few weeks ago , it was the fourth of july , " she continued . " they got me out and threw a handful of fireworks on the day of the anniversary , then they got me into
[533/1000]	he began to speak , but before he started , it occurred to me that we were in the process of drawing the fire back and set it free . how 'd i end up with more stuff and still
[534/1000]	i should n't want her <EOS> so , i thought , i should want to take it with me . i should n't want to lose it . and she thought my father would get the name '
[535/1000]	" there we go , mr. mason . " she smiled . i leaned over and took her in my arms . " damn , i 'm going to miss you on christmas . " she giggled as
[536/1000]	" we have n't exactly been able to find any evidence that could give us some means of proving the existence of other living things , you know , " said amy . " in fact , we could n't
[537/1000]	" no problem . you want eggs ? " " sure . " " anything in particular in particular that you 'd like to get all out of the fridge ? " " no . "
[538/1000]	" did n't i already say nothing was going to happen with you ? " grace laughed because she 'd known it would . " have you called an ambulance ? " he shook his head . "
[539/1000]	she sighed softly and a little blush colored her cheeks . " i feel different when we drink together , different and ... sexy and - " i looked at her in confusion . " right now , i
[540/1000]	" it meant more than you thought it would , " she said . " when she went , i could not find my way to you . even those who went to you , i had no idea how
[541/1000]	jack was n't used to public speaking ; had n't done much of it since his teenage years . he found it overwhelming at times so he did n't speak . " do your parents know ? this means
[542/1000]	" yeah . some of it . " i looked over toward the field , then in the direction of the parking lot , where the driver would n't be able to see out to his jeep . "
[543/1000]	" yes , and then to a part of his life . " her lips had begun to turn upward . " a part of his life ? " he echoed , not even his imagination could fathom what
[544/1000]	" i am a fool . a good , simple fool , " he finished with a sigh . " listen to me , " she insisted . " we are all fools , and you are none of
[545/1000]	" who 's he ? " " he 's a cop , " she said . " he 's with the church of the holy se pul ch re . " " holy se pul ch re ?
[546/1000]	she could feel his body stir within her . " and that 's my name , honey . i 'm always yours . " he nuzzled her behind , just right , and she shivered at the sudden sense
[547/1000]	' no , it 's your right . but that could be bad luck . ' ' there 's no choice , ' kaz said . ' he had to use me to get across to the him ala
[548/1000]	" i 'm coming with you . " to be honest , i would n't have minded her accompanying me . i think being friends is always good for everyone , especially when the feeling is mutual . "
[549/1000]	" i 'm telling you , we really are connected ! " said the child . it was a joke . as the group continued to ride to the tower , thetra and ther r had gone a
[550/1000]	" i never could have imagined that . " " there are plenty of pictures of him playing in the theater . you just have to keep focusing on his work in the hope that you 'll not find
[551/1000]	" that . i know i wo n't . i just do n't want to lose you . " " i wo n't do that . " my body seemed to tighten through the pain , and a gasp
[552/1000]	" i take it that he - " " no , " said a voice that was n't his . " let 's go . " " let you go ? a woman is trying to murder
[553/1000]	" with her , i feel like i know everything , " i confess . " she had no secrets with me . " dante holds his hands up in protest . " i do n't care what her
[554/1000]	" oh ... " she murmured , thinking she 'd gone a little mad waiting for me . when does david get to be in my house ? she shook her head . that would never happen . she always
[555/1000]	the entire castle was empty , except for the two horses . " the guards , " asked samuel . a bit confused , the prince nodded . " when it came time to wake you up ,
[556/1000]	his smile , too , changed as his body relaxed . " that you do . go ahead and use my name . " no , i did n't want to use your name . i was n't sure
[557/1000]	" uh huh . they 're coming . " something caught my eye out the window , and i felt a hot stab of dread . i felt like i was going to do something i never thought i
[558/1000]	a shadow fell behind him , and then a tiny flame - like yellow butterfly darted into his path . " wait , " he replied , catching the tiny butterfly in his hands . he lifted her gently and
[559/1000]	one of the passengers rolled his eyes . " what your wish is to know , " he said dryly . " if you please ! " she said as loudly as she dared , then stopped abruptly when
[560/1000]	" are you ready ? " " did someone call you ? " he asked . " no , my mother . she 's in the hospital . " " is she up in the operating room
[561/1000]	for me , it was always good for me . i might not be able to touch him as much anymore , but it was much the same . there were too many parts of me that were still raw
[562/1000]	he cleared his throat as he stared out the window . he was glad he 'd brought the key for it . yes , the last time he 'd driven that way in the dark had been when he
[563/1000]	i stared <EOS> my reflection around the front room , letting my eyes study the kitchen and get the blood from the bottle that had the same contents . then my gaze drifted to the photo hanging from the mantel
[564/1000]	the only one i 've ever talked to about it is the boy whose name i do n't want him to remember ; and he told me that he was your brother . he left the only words that i
[565/1000]	" that 's why i 'm here , huh ? " there was a pause , and i wondered if he was having second thoughts . " maybe i need to tell you about me . my mom 's
[566/1000]	" so did she , " the woman said , a smile on her face . " and now the kid in her ... it 's fun . " " so maybe i 'll have to find her a
[567/1000]	now , i understood why my mother said i was so beautiful . my skin was so pale that my tan did n't look like a light brown for many days , it looked like velvet , and my eyes
[568/1000]	" i will not let you . " " there is no such thing as too harsh language . " " i will make a deal with you . if you let me pass , i will tell
[569/1000]	" now that is a loaded question , " michael added . " but why are you telling me ? because you feel that i do n't understand how you feel the way i do ? " " i
[570/1000]	" you 're a smart guy . are n't you , honey ? " " i bet your mom is thinking you 're about to be arrested for murder ! " " maybe . would n't that be
[571/1000]	we 're leaving our friends back at the hotel , what the hell ? i do n't ever want to be in a packed bar again . maybe if i did want to go on a real date . it
[572/1000]	the rest of the evening ran by in a blur for her . she only really watched what was playing on the game , and not how long he was going to do it . he made love to her
[573/1000]	" i know . " i took a sip from my straw and it made me feel a little better , at least for now . " she was a mess that night , " i said .
[574/1000]	i felt a rush of emotion , not of my own accord , but something in the way he looked . i just knew that i would never see him again . what 's that ? " how
[575/1000]	" i 'll take care of him , " daniel said . the door swung open as they moved out of her way . her brother and friend met them at the door . " hello , girls
[576/1000]	" can we hear more about the girls ? " jason asked . that thought made me uneasy because the first night there , they were in the living room . somehow they had been taken before the police .
[577/1000]	she tried to wrap that phrase around her , but was failing miserably . " yes , but someone is hurt . she thinks she 's dead , but she 's not , so that 's a good thing .
[578/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " " nothing . i just thought you should know that the two guards have moved away , " said the major , with a smile , apparently trying to be reassuring .
[579/1000]	" you better believe i 'm going to make it through this . " she laughed and kissed him . " you 'd better . you still have to walk . " they sat on the ground with
[580/1000]	i watched as the one who 'd asked about the car started to pull out of the lot . immediately , i thought about what he might see where his home was . " where do you think these
[581/1000]	" this is not a nice place , " i said . she did n't answer . a single tear ran without her consent down our chins . she did n't move for several minutes , but finally she
[582/1000]	" what do i do ? " " hang it on the wall above the head of the bed . in that direction you can rest your weight on the bottom side and prop yourself up if you run
[583/1000]	" you guys know each other ? " i whispered . " almost . " he kissed my forehead , and i smiled . " hey , i ca n't believe you got me into this . "
[584/1000]	" we 'll need something bigger next time . " " i 've got plenty of time , " said the cat . " can we have a picnic ? " " i did n't want to ,
[585/1000]	" your mother says you get sick easily . she thinks you 're suffering from that case of p ms . " " my stress levels ? i 'll tell her you mentioned it . " she grinned
[586/1000]	" have you any idea who she might be ? " i asked . " no . not even the name of a club . i think it 's a game chang er . that 's weird . "
[587/1000]	" i love you . " he leaned in and kissed her gently , her eyes opened as she stared up into his , her eyes full of life . " i love you too " she whispered as
[588/1000]	he was about to demand an explanation when she said she had remembered a painting . an image of a woman holding a vase in her hands came into focus , which sent her heart leaping again . had she
[589/1000]	" right , and he 's also trying to get away from me , " she continued . " but , " i said . " because of the fire , no one in the world will touch you
[590/1000]	" yes , i am ! now get your things and take out of here , and keep someone else in the cabin . " she stomped off , a dark cloud in her wake . the man smiled
[591/1000]	it sounds like a conversation out loud . i do n't want to let them down . so i take her hand and get my head out from beneath her hair and look up at her . her eyes
[592/1000]	" oh shit , " he sighed , dropping her feet softly on the floor , then dragging her body closer . he braced his hands on either side of her . " you still sound so damn beautiful ,
[593/1000]	he was n't in the mood for listening to her make up bad sex stories . " a few weeks for the doctors , a couple more for that trip to la , we just wanted a break .
[594/1000]	' what happened to your face ? ' ' i 'm not sure , sir . i tried , ' vimes confessed . ' at least , i tried . i got away , i think , but there
[595/1000]	" <EOS> " " so that 's why we 're working on the story , " he says , leaning over and reading her script . " and when we go to the beach , we can just watch
[596/1000]	the guy dropped the wrench , and that left him more or less free to drop the other one . he walked over and picked up both . " the door goes up or down and under . all you
[597/1000]	" you ca n't trust them ! " " i ca n't find one that 's not half mad , " i retort . i ca n't hide . " for god 's sake , get your
[598/1000]	" would n't you ? " she asked and then promptly smiled . one side of her lips caught in a fake smile of her own . " not real . not really . i did n't want that either
[599/1000]	" i did ! " they ran down the alley and through the open front door to the apartment . it was a dump but max had always thought the place looked fine . it had a view out
[600/1000]	" i 'm not one to mince words , but i think he sees my intentions as an opportunity to do <EOS> or even blackmail him . he considers this to be an honour to him , yet he believes
[601/1000]	he stepped up his pace until he was standing over her . before anyone could blink , he was in front of her , gently pushing her back until she was laid out across the bed . still ,
[602/1000]	you would n't think it , because she was perfectly clear on how much of a bastard he was . but he was . in his heart . only he was the one giving her a reason to hate him
[603/1000]	" oh . " she said , " i ... um ... actually ... i do n't even know what to say . i was supposed to meet him on the third floor . " " really ? "
[604/1000]	" tell me , why did you choose me to spend half your days with ? " he asked . kiara scowled . " my life was a lie , nykyrian ... " he squeezed her hand as
[605/1000]	there was still a good hour before dinner and they were glad to have some time to themselves . " what will we be doing after we get a table ? " susan asked . " i guess
[606/1000]	" they like the ladies , you know . " " oh i think i shall have to check that . " " very good . i asked ms. taylor to turn on the heater , and to
[607/1000]	" well , let 's just say you need to be protected , and you 'd better do it soon . " the thought of coming back here , seeing the house , was unbearable . " i do
[608/1000]	" you 're too smart for me , " he tells me as he kisses me once . " i 'm too smart for you , mr. morris , " i say before grabbing my shirt and pants .
[609/1000]	" you ca n't break me , you 're going to give it away . there will be no fighting for it . " " i 'm not afraid of you , " i said as i let go
[610/1000]	" it 's better than freezing up here . " he let his hand drop to my shoulder and he turned me toward the couch . he was so close that our faces were touching . he leaned over so
[611/1000]	so , why were they wasting her time here ? " if you want dinner , i do n't know if we can afford dinner . " he was on his feet instantly , his hands coming to
[612/1000]	he 'd said . it was just a matter of time . " i 've taken my chances , " he said abruptly . " it wo n't happen again . " she swallowed . " i did
[613/1000]	" this is a good place to hide , " kaladin said . " i want to talk with the men on the perimeter before the city gates . moash , i am going with you . " "
[614/1000]	she could n't put it on and look at his face . all she knew is that things had changed . not so much about this man as he was different from any other man she 'd dated . so
[615/1000]	' yes , <EOS> sir . ' ' great fun for i have travelled to see you . ' ' you have it mr mo she i have not seen you once . ' ' you have
[616/1000]	" ah , and i suppose you have n't mentioned this to her , have you ? " he said after a moment , his voice like ice . " no , no . " my hand had been
[617/1000]	" mr. benson ? " i asked , but that was all . just a strange name . the woman was smiling back at me , her voice soft , her eyes sparkling like clear blue gemstones in her ebony
[618/1000]	" maybe i did n't agree . " " no , you did n't . " " do n't remind me . " " yeah , that 's just how i was . " " you
[619/1000]	he looked at the picture but to his horror she was laughing . her whole face was covered with bright red tears . he glared at her for a moment before his eyes rolled back in his head ,
[620/1000]	he turns them off . still , the people here are not all that receptive to being lied to . they will look past the lies to see more clearly . he stands up , looking through the open door
[621/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " when you died , you were out searching for treasure for something . i bet that was what killed the wolf . " " hmm ... " i took a
[622/1000]	" i love you , too . it 's you that 's making me crazy . you 're breaking me in half , in more ways than one . " he kissed me sweetly , and then smiled crookedly
[623/1000]	" i need you to tell me why you are suddenly so interested in what this other person wants on your list . " " i ca n't . i 've tried with mr. spencer , but he does
[624/1000]	" well , why do n't you move to the other side and spend some time with your brother , and we can check on you , all right ? can you come to san francisco for a few days
[625/1000]	" yeah . " " well , we need to get a move on . you can take over as first guy . we wo n't let his buddy have it all . " " thanks bro .
[626/1000]	" you sound worried . " she shook her head . " no , i 'm just tired . i 'd go see if it 's still on and then i 'd go . i just think you might
[627/1000]	i guess so . " " i mean , my parents and my sister and my brother are both here . i mean , it 's crazy if someone 's just like me . " " what about
[628/1000]	" you ca n't expect me to be mad at you - it 's hard enough as it is . " " i know . " sighing again , she pulled her gaze from the map and turned it
[629/1000]	it took that long for the tears to stop flowing . i stared at her in horror . " okay , let 's take a real break , " rachel said , reaching over and giving me a squeeze
[630/1000]	" you say it like a woman . you may have the money , but i have the power . " " you have no authority over me ! i do this , and we are done . "
[631/1000]	" so what are you going to do , david ? " he shrugged . " get bored . sit around and wait for her to come home . " mary ann glanced around the kitchen . "
[632/1000]	" because . it 's hard - really hard . you want a baby that has n't yet lost its dad . you do n't want to lose him in your own time , in your own house . "
[633/1000]	" get your things . we 've got to head back to the base . " no , no , no . my eyes narrowed . " tell me what happens . " he looked at the
[634/1000]	what did he have ? and why did he want to get it ? my chest grew tight with emotion . i turned to face him and took a deep breath . " the first thing i
[635/1000]	not when this was over and nothing mattered but what i had to offer . except the man in my bed . shit . * * * * * " so the new me gives you
[636/1000]	with a shake of her head , she was about to press the issue , but her sister 's voice rose before she could . " you know , if you do n't need a date , i can
[637/1000]	" oh , all right . " i say as i head to the door . " but i 'm here until monday then i 'm taking everything with me . " " we 'll let you go when
[638/1000]	he was n't at all surprised when she had put an end to their time together . he knew she had made a mistake in giving it up , but he would never be responsible for her losing everything .
[639/1000]	" oh . " i hesitated . if i was n't here he would n't know that but he was . " you want to hang out ? " his eyes widened in surprise . " really ? "
[640/1000]	she nodded . " it 's very old . " where did ye get it ? " he lifted himself up to a sitting position . " oh , hugh - " " where , then ?
[641/1000]	the world looked like dead trees . nothing stood on any of the surfaces of the massive trees . no lights were on . the sky overhead was clear of the smog , but the air was thick with blood
[642/1000]	" good , as long as it is you , " she replied . " very well , " he answered , laughing . he was ready with a topic . " well , as long as this job
[643/1000]	i have to accept that somehow he 's changed , at least in the beginning . the changes are just visible in the way he acts , the way he talks ; he 's the same cold , hard man
[644/1000]	she did n't answer . " if you tell me about this , it 'll be my turn , " he said . " not because i 'm trying to figure out if this is some kind of a
[645/1000]	he found them . the door was unlocked , and they filed into the room . * * * the walls were dark . the carpet was worn . there was n't anything to remind you of
[646/1000]	" we could turn myself in if they have one of my cards on them . " he had the better idea , but he also knew that he could n't just walk out of here . only death could
[647/1000]	it 's nothing . i hate it when she feels that way . i look over at her , and there 's such hunger on her face that i feel a little queasy . i wish i could take her
[648/1000]	" not him . " " look , " she started , and saw her father go over to the table and open the wine bag , " dad , " the man said , " i know we
[649/1000]	then again , she 'd been on the first plane out of atlanta , and she 'd been doing her own thing for the last six months . " she 'll be fine . " but he still did
[650/1000]	" oh my god , is the whole damn world here ? " i asked no one in particular . " not even our little village . " i was in the kitchen of my apartment , checking on
[651/1000]	i pushed aside my disgust and my embarrassment , even as the song started . i loved this song ; it reminded me of the song i had in my head for quite some time . the music filled
[652/1000]	she looked from jake to jake 's boss , then back again . " um ... how about a glass of water in the kitchen ? " " sure . " jake followed her into a kitchen that reminded
[653/1000]	" ' i heard you and your company was taking a break . ' " " she was n't . " " who , you who we 're taking a break from now ? " he said
[654/1000]	" i 'm going to be with this baby , " i said quietly . " i know , sis " - he kissed my nose and glanced back at taylor - " but we have to focus on
[655/1000]	" i 'm not going to run from you and you know it . " she was really close to tears . " let me change first . " he ran his fingers through her hair . " you
[656/1000]	i watched his gaze drop to my mouth . oh my god . was he trying to kiss me ? i could n't breathe . shit ! why did we pick that moment ? i was going to hurl .
[657/1000]	" how are we going to do that ? " john asked , " with your bow ? " he pointed to the shaft . " we need an arrow but we do n't know how strong these folks 's
[658/1000]	" i guess we can try it . " she said . " would you believe the number of times that a boy i named nicholas brought up his name for me ? i hated him for that . "
[659/1000]	so , by the time we arrived onto a dirt road that would eventually lead us to her duplex through the woods , i had started to calm down . the pain i 'd felt a minute before had morphed
[660/1000]	" you 're an idiot , " i pointed out , sliding a little closer to him again . " that idiot did n't read anything on my computer . " i found his eyes again and felt the
[661/1000]	" and a pair of boots ? " " <EOS> ... or something . " " maybe i 'd like to be a stripper . " they each laughed . " i 'm always thinking how good
[662/1000]	" i 'm not sure . maybe some kind of an angel turned up on our doorstep ? " cassie suggested in a soothing voice . " or , maybe , that some dude i 've never met has
[663/1000]	" where has she gone ? " " she 's walking with her friend . they 're getting to know each other . i asked her if she wants to come over so that we can hang out .
[664/1000]	" see you inside , " he said , and without looking back he strode forward and cut through the crowd to the patio doors that led out to the front garden . inside , i locked the doors
[665/1000]	" what ? " he did n't , and she could see that on his face , a little bit . " did you hear me ? " she shook her head . " i heard you . "
[666/1000]	by nightfall , the party consisted of all seven of them . the cook , a huge man in the company of several thousand men , had told them about this camp on their journey . he explained that there
[667/1000]	he sighed , and i bit down harder on the inside of my cheek to stop me from crying . " she loved it , " i said in a shaky voice . was it possible to feel so
[668/1000]	i found a small alcove beneath the staircase that might serve as shelter for the children of the sky . i gathered the other adults together . martin , still out at sea , pulled the boat into the dock
[669/1000]	" not while you 're around her . " adam grunted , " yeah right . " " what 's wrong ? " " nothing , " adam muttered getting to his feet . the last thing
[670/1000]	" and so it shall be , " said mistress lock ley , giving her hand a final squeeze , and letting her go . " bring your mistress there ... not to the front gate . but to the
[671/1000]	chapter twenty for olivia and olivia , the night had started out perfectly . after the event , they had gone into a cozy restaurant in the parking lot of valentino . and before taking the long bath in
[672/1000]	she could n't wait to pick up her mom 's new dress next week for some sexy shopping trip . even though she was n't a virgin - not even physically - she definitely knew she wanted to try on
[673/1000]	" is this my fault ? " i could n't hold the tears down any longer . i 'd told myself not to touch the box , but all i could feel was my chin shake . " that
[674/1000]	this is a new idea for me . or would have been . ' wait , ' i say . ' what 's this ? ' i reach over and take his arm . ' remember when you said
[675/1000]	the door opened , and a man with graying hair stood in the archway . he smiled at them as he set a plate of sandwiches and tea on the table . " good afternoon , officers , " he
[676/1000]	" i think you 'll come to love one more place , " he says and then leaves . i sit down on the bed next to sarah and open the box . it has the letter on it
[677/1000]	" so not quite ? " he asked . i shook my head and slid off his lap . i tossed the pillow aside , rolled off of him and put my hands on my h * ps
[678/1000]	" i 'm not an idiot . i already told you that the police checked through his pockets . i know what he does for a living . and he wants to work for you . i know he does
[679/1000]	if mrs. walker was a witch , she could control things , whether she was alive or not . i 'd never seen her use one , but she seemed to know i was interested in her . i was
[680/1000]	" what part of ' the great ' do n't you understand ? " james asks and waves his hands in front of my face . " i dunno . " i shrug and fiddle with the rim of
[681/1000]	he must have mistaken it for his imagination . " there are , " i reiterated . he nodded . " of course . " i leaned closer . " which box are you in ? "
[682/1000]	" um , i have seen him ? " " oh yeah . about as tall as you is . " " he 's got blond hair . " " blond hair is something all wolves have
[683/1000]	" i 'm already worried they will fire you if he is given too many to fire . he needs more men " she replied . " what about his friend " suggested henry . " like i
[684/1000]	he looked down at the dog and gave it a pat . " nice to see you , too , boy . you keep a good nose dog . " " i keep a dog because i 'm lonely
[685/1000]	" what ? " he said . " why do n't we go straight to the doctor ? " " what doctor ? i do n't have any medications for that crap , " i said . " and
[686/1000]	" you have another choice , " he said , his voice rumbling through the car as he pulled into a parking space . " make up something original , like a picture of a giant snake , and give
[687/1000]	emma said nothing . " we 're looking for a mr. mason , " rachel explained . " ah , he is my brother - in - law , he stopped by to see me a few weeks
[688/1000]	and not a day go by when you should have been concentrating ! it was n't like she was looking for a big score like he was doing . " i hear you do n't get to enjoy the game
[689/1000]	" i 'm afraid you will never understand that , darling , " he said , pulling a pair of gold reading glasses off the shelf on his desk and placing them over his eyes . " i hope that
[690/1000]	" not an option , and we ca n't just assume he left with your sister . she needs to remain in your care . " " does this have anything to do with noah ? " i 'm
[691/1000]	' hey , he 's here ! ' shouted someone in the crowd inside the church . ' oh ... my god , it 's ... is ... him ! ' shouted one of the other soldiers .
[692/1000]	at last , when their faces were no longer visible to either of them , amira sighed and laid her head back on her paws . from the village , they were heading north on the highway , and amira
[693/1000]	" this could n't be a coincidence . " she said as she turned to me . " what do you mean ? " " there was something there in her office yesterday . as we walked to
[694/1000]	" then i will . , " said the duke . " but first let me ask . " he paused and ran a finger down alexandra 's face . " and while i am at it ... will you
[695/1000]	" you did n't hurt me , " i breathed , dazed but unhurt . " i mean it , " he said fiercely and took my face in his hands . i closed my eyes and tried
[696/1000]	what have i gotten myself into ? the last chance of a lifetime are on my mind , more than i 've ever planned . " i ca n't do it , honey , " he mutters . "
[697/1000]	" i do n't think i told you that , " she went on , " i 've been getting good at spotting . the things i do see - " i followed up her words with a yawn ,
[698/1000]	he placed his hand on and around the inside of her elbow , leading her slowly forward . she barely heard the door shut behind them . chapter ten " did you see the way the man
[699/1000]	i sit back on my heels and close my eyes for dramatic effect . " then maybe i should put down some roots to make my fortune in a business . " " like what ? " "
[700/1000]	" i gave him another night . he was on it . i had to drive to town and check things out . " " sounds like a quick run to you , " he said with a wink
[701/1000]	and i guess that 's a good thing , because there 's nothing more we can say to each other by way of words , because our tongue just stays up against each other , and then by the time
[702/1000]	and that was what i am doing now or at least i hope it is . i know why i am doing this . i have wanted to make sure that my son will not be on this planet with
[703/1000]	" we 're on our way , " james said , and he pulled me into his arms . " when did you start wearing jeans ? " i joked , knowing exactly what he was talking about .
[704/1000]	i did one last look behind me . and then i turned and headed back inside , calling over my shoulder , " thanks , i could use the company myself tonight . if you find anything else that
[705/1000]	only if we meet him . " " we do . " " come on over here so the sun 's out . " they looked at me questioningly . i explained that we had found alex
[706/1000]	" it 's all in his head . " " go ahead . tell me . " " there were a few instances when he was n't watching me like he should . i just wanted to be
[707/1000]	well ... there might 've been something in her voice . when she said , " excuse me , " she sounded more like a bored mom than ever . like it was one thing to have to be a
[708/1000]	" your mom is very kind . " " she is . she 's a lawyer . she 's always been my sister 's friend . it still does n't mean i ca n't see her . "
[709/1000]	" i hate to say things like that ... for your sake , i 've never been inside of one , but it 's obvious you really belong on that ranch . you 're amazing . " he looked
[710/1000]	' do n't worry about it , though . if we 're lucky , we 'll find a village and they 'll take care of us like everyone else . ' he was about to comment again , but
[711/1000]	" you really love them , " she finally said , giving me a smile i did n't think she 'd done in a long time . yeah , we all loved them . chapter 20 my
[712/1000]	" sure , " he said . " the old lady told me . " " mr. o' to ole called me to explain , " i said . " to tell me you 're going to be arrested
[713/1000]	the guy just stared at her and then jumped to his feet . " yes ! " he took off at a dead run , and as he ran , he looked back , saw her standing in the middle
[714/1000]	sam stared at him . " i ca n't allow that . it 's why you 're here . " " not true . i do n't want you hurt . do n't ever speak those words to me
[715/1000]	" what do you mean you do n't have more troops ? " " all i have is some more swords for my troops . all the rest i 'm using to protect them , " said alexander ,
[716/1000]	i was half tempted to say , " yes sir " or " yes sir , sir . " before i could and , when i thought about the way the day had gone wrong , the idea , which
[717/1000]	she wanted to feel him inside her again , all from the point of contact . she could n't resist turning her head his way just in case his eyes had changed . the tension was so thick she
[718/1000]	suddenly , the door swung open and she did not have to see his eyes . she had seen that look before . his gaze was locked on her . the other witch had not moved .
[719/1000]	he came down the stone steps and reached for the handle of the door . he had one more question to ask her , one he did n't want to answer , where the hell were the keys ?
[720/1000]	she smiled at him and then dropped her gaze - then met his . she did n't want to miss anything . those beautiful green eyes went from dark to electric ... and then wide as he leaned closer .
[721/1000]	i 've got that one . he did n't like being trapped in this nightmare . even now , he could see there were shadows beneath the surface . he 'd seen the very faint light of a cell
[722/1000]	" if you decide to quit , just let me know , okay ? " " i 'll think about it . " that was n't the answer i expected . " talk to you later . "
[723/1000]	my head jerks up , and my eyes meet his in surprise . " i 'm not sure how we landed here . i have no idea why your apartment complex has this huge gate . " "
[724/1000]	" so do i , " michael said happily , and we all laughed . " is this a joke ? " i asked , surprised . " you never joke about having kids ? " " no
[725/1000]	" well , you must be famished , " she added with a smile . " not yet , " he responded and leaned down to kiss her on the forehead . she immediately turned into his arms and
[726/1000]	" really , really good . " he leans back and sighs , running his hands through his hair . " i 'm just saying that it could be a bad thing that happens next week . i ca n't
[727/1000]	" you do n't have to go anywhere , " she whispered . " i want to be able to spend more time with you . i want to spend time with you . " he lowered his
[728/1000]	but i could n't . not yet , anyway . i needed to wait until the spring . and make sure i was not the first one to go after those three suspects tonight , if i even became one
[729/1000]	she held a single finger up to her lips . " shh . i 've talked to mr. har grove , " her mother replied . " we 're not under attack . " " i thought we
[730/1000]	" well , we 're all aware of jack 's penchant for taking his wife to bed , do n't we ? " " but what does that have to do with jack 's activities ? " "
[731/1000]	" there 's something very interesting . " but when he glanced at me i could see the interest in his gaze . " so , just so i do n't get the wrong impression , do you think you
[732/1000]	" no need to be afraid , brother . we are the same in every way . " and all along , the monster inside had been waiting . but now ... now it was being unleashed .
[733/1000]	there was a great silence as they watched jake 's body slump to the floor . he was so limp , he did n't even stir . then laura began to walk slowly over to the body and help
[734/1000]	" it 's not something we can discuss over dinner , " i say , unable to resist teasing him . " then what ? " he asks , lifting a stubborn brow . i ca n't help it
[735/1000]	" ok , " she said . " but i 'm in command now , that 's all . " the director was impressed . she was old enough that she could have been back inside her own unit
[736/1000]	but i knew better than to believe that . one might say his feelings would not change . i knew his heart was with the one woman that would make it all worth it . his hand slid up
[737/1000]	" you can look around from here , " michael suggested , " and then i have to check my email first . " " are n't you worried about it ? " michael asked . " i
[738/1000]	and she was being pushed everywhere . oh , how she wanted that body . she was n't allowed to have that body anytime . she was to dress in what she liked , to make herself presentable ,
[739/1000]	as he rolled me down onto my back , he grabbed the zipper of his jeans and started pulling them down . " help me , gunner ! " he jumped on top of me and plunged into
[740/1000]	but the house was empty , so i rang the doorbell and waited . i heard footsteps , and tried to pretend i was waiting for david . he took a few minutes to answer the door . " how
[741/1000]	" come on , you . " " wait here . " he bent down and lifted her by the waist . she grabbed his arms and pulled him forward toward her . the light of the
[742/1000]	when i opened my eyes she left with the car keys . the doors unlocked automatically in her hands after i pushed the ignition and stepped out of the car . i was in the process of buttoning the front
[743/1000]	nick 's phone rang , and it was his father 's number . " dad , " nick answered . " son , where the hell are you ? and why are you so late ? i got
[744/1000]	he stopped . " he 's a bastard . " " he 's a pain in the ass , " i said . " he is . " " what kind of person is he ? "
[745/1000]	it would n't do to use her abilities on an enemy , who could be made to feel the way she did . she wanted to force herself into that situation , the way she wanted to use anyone else
[746/1000]	" as for you . you just were n't up for anything else . after i 'd brought out the handcuffs , then we saw ' that , ' you started to fight . i called 911 . come to
[747/1000]	" yes , " he said simply . " why the hell not ? " she muttered . " because ... " a look of astonishment crossed his face . " it 's impossible for you . "
[748/1000]	" is that one of your brothers ? the one who - ? " she laughed . " no , that 's my brother . his name is shane . " he smiled at her as he passed

[750/1000]	" this , " said gregor , picking up a small bottle that contained an amount of water , " is just about all water i had last night . " the water looked like something out of a submarine
[751/1000]	" i 'm going to see me a bit while i 'm there . there 's a lot of people watching this . " jake said . " there 'll be things you do n't know about . "
[752/1000]	as soon as it had seen it , the fire died down , and they stood there , holding each other in its midst , afraid to break the hold of a kiss . from across the lake a figure

[755/1000]	" come again ? " " you told me once that you could find him in his prison . when it came down to it , you wanted him to be here . now i 'm here . "
[756/1000]	the doors closed , and dr. bo ggs said , " you 'd better see your doctor . just get the equipment in place , then come on back . " without another word , he turned and left .
[757/1000]	" it 's almost five , " i said . " i 'll help you pack . " as i said it , i wondered where my brother was . then i shook myself back to the present as the

[759/1000]	i rolled my shoulders , feeling strange , the scars having healed well . " i do n't know what to have on hand . the police report was awful . the book we printed has some , but i
[760/1000]	there was some sort of metal door , and we stepped through into a large room . the room had a large oval table - like seating . the sides were lined with shelves full of bottles , but
[761/1000]	" you 're saying that god has n't told us everything already ? " i chuckled . " well , we do n't really know about him , but ... maybe he does , some day . "
[762/1000]	" his car started without no help . " there it is : the reason the others seem like they 're gon na drop dead , and we 're looking at a small chance to get rid of its troublesome
[763/1000]	" that way you can spend quite a lot of time on the phone , you do n't have to worry about anything . " for a long moment , they stared at each other . i felt like
[764/1000]	two days later , in a room filled with patients , i was reminded of the very things i was not . just then a familiar face entered the room , a man who had recently put on so many
[765/1000]	" she 's here , " she whispered , hoping to stir him out of the dream . and he was always in the dream , she realized . in his dreams she could see him clearly , even
[766/1000]	he closed the doors and held his hand out to her , she took it , and he gently turned her toward him . she held in a deep breath , waited . something was still wrong .
[767/1000]	" what 's that supposed to mean ? " " that even though we ca n't stand a vampire , as far as vampires go , we have no problem with humans . vampires are the thing of legends
[768/1000]	" you 're so hot , jack . " " i think you 're the one hot . " his eyes darken . " but i want you too . " he pulls my hands off of him
[769/1000]	" do you really believe that ? you and i took a vacation when i was nineteen and i saw the face of the guy who had you . that man had been the same age as me . he
[770/1000]	i knew the last time i took a bite like that , he 'd have to get something to clean the floor . " you are quite the little thief . " i opened my mouth to respond
[771/1000]	to his surprise , his anger did n't diminish . " what do you want with me , you vile , disgusting , f * * king ... cunt ? " he screamed . " get out of here
[772/1000]	" tell me where you found that stupid car on that highway , and then we 'll talk about it . " " i 'm sure i 'll come up with a way to make a point , "
[773/1000]	" what ? " liam cleared his throat while he looked at me . " if you 're going to walk away from me - i just - i thought it would be better with you . "
[774/1000]	" what are you doing up , " he said , and shifted closer . he looked hurt . " i thought you and i were going to sleep . " it 's a normal reaction to the cold
[775/1000]	" well , if i could be more specific - " " no , thank you . " " so , he told me that he was gon na have a barbecue at the farmhouse , and i
[776/1000]	i was glad he was n't looking my way , for i could n't look at him when i raised my voice . " please ! please ! no more , no more , don't don't - stop ! "
[777/1000]	" i must move away . he has not been happy with my company , especially in bed . " " the house is empty ? " " your brother should not be at a loss . he
[778/1000]	his eyes lit up in wonder . " then you 're in for a treat . not even a big one . " " i would n't expect you to give it anywhere near so much . i 'm
[779/1000]	" we know , " i say as we pause in front of the house . i see conner and becca walking in the driveway and hop from the hood of the truck . " um , are you
[780/1000]	a sudden gust of wind came up from the hills behind them and sent them tumbling over . " what now ? " barak asked again . " just go a while , " silk told him ,
[781/1000]	i do n't want to . i 'm sure it 's meant that i 'll probably be looking at someone else anytime soon . what 's your problem ? i 'm doing fine now . i 'll be fine .
[782/1000]	" damn . " his head dipped for a quick kiss before lifting it and smiling at her . " i 'll probably go up while you 're talking . " " i 'll be long at home .
[783/1000]	" if mom had another kid , she 'd be a different man . " logan 's expression hardened . " she might . " logan closed his eyes briefly , hating to admit his sister 's past
[784/1000]	" there 's some stuff i need to tell you , " she said , and turned to go . he kept pace with her , getting comfortable and leaning across the seat until she stopped . she kept
[785/1000]	" you 'd f * * k her ? to get information ? " " do you want that ? for the price of a cup of coffee , i plan to find out . " he watched
[786/1000]	" you can forget that , " he said , dropping the bottle of whiskey onto the floor next to his feet . " i want you now . " grabbing her by the hand , he held it out
[787/1000]	the door swung open and a scowling nicholas strode in , followed closely by a tall blonde . he was also in jeans and a long - sleeved tee ; his coloring was lighter than rachel 's , and he
[788/1000]	" yes , yes . as i recall , that was your last sentence . now do ye tell me where ye 're from and how ye came to be here ? and before i kill ye , why do
[789/1000]	one by one as people slowly left for the day on their day off , the others were alone again , including the driver . " you 're taking me home ? " he said when nick held his
[790/1000]	" you 're welcome , " my dad said . he pulled a stool onto the breakfast bar and crossed his legs , leaning on it thoughtfully . " i 'm not that much older than joseph . he may
[791/1000]	so yes . * * * * the room was empty . only a faint line marred the back wall and no two other doors were in sight . she hesitated near the doorway . this
[792/1000]	she ignored his challenge . she 'd found out his name last night and had n't heard from him in days . she had a small , token letter hanging in her jewelry box , a message that read ,
[793/1000]	' well he was n't , ' she whispered . ' how do you know ? ' she shrugged . ' i guess i see him every few weeks or so . in time he does n't stop
[794/1000]	i waited in my room for my cousin to come back . every minute spent in my room , feeling frustrated with myself for not becoming what someone wanted me to be , made me angrier and angrier .
[795/1000]	" and did he kill his brother ? " " yes . " " and you know that in the case of the second man , there was no reason for the third man to have killed his
[796/1000]	" who said anything about you using my job as leverage to blackmail . " " he did . you broke into his house in the middle of the night and saw - " she broke off , unable
[797/1000]	" do you have any idea how gorgeous you are ? " a soft giggle escaped him as his face blushed just a bit as he leaned in closer to me , those words i just never imagined coming from
[798/1000]	" you did n't really expect to ride that thing over , did you ? not having to worry about being caught with my panties around my ankles is a bonus , " she said with a laugh . she
[799/1000]	michael had saved her life , but even he knew he was n't the one she wanted . she needed to let the fire die down . and she would . not until she knew everything .
[800/1000]	the last time her sister had been this upset about a guy that she 'd been with her fiancé . her mind reeled from that revelation . had he found out somehow that her parents knew about the affair ,
[801/1000]	" what ? " " you 're a demon , " i said quietly , still unable to believe i was actually saying these things . his eyes lit up . " you do n't get it ?
[802/1000]	" you must be really worried about my father , " she told him . " he 's only a doctor . he knows things he should n't , " he mumbled . emily did n't believe that
[803/1000]	" what are your plans ? " ryan asked . " do you want to head back to the states ? " " no , in case the governor wants me to go , " she said . "
[804/1000]	i can see that he 's hoping to kill some of the others , with the most dangerous weapon in the ship , but he does manage to let me go . the others have already split up ,
[805/1000]	she would have been glad to know ; he was so distant from her . the truth came out before she could stop herself . " he has been dead for less than thirty years . " " so
[806/1000]	" you have a whole lot more going on than an old fart like me . " he shifted in his chair , one dark eyebrow cocked up . " i 'm sensing that . " ignoring him
[807/1000]	" and that would be , as you all know by now , the worst thing a zombie could do in a lifetime . that 's why they eat their food , not just meat . " i was
[808/1000]	" maybe she knows him ? " " you think that 's it ? " " could be , " eve huffed . he grabbed her face , tilting it back to look at him , " are
[809/1000]	" i have to keep up appearances . she will want this . " " well , keep me updated . " " you 've got that . " he took a deep breath and exhaled .
[810/1000]	" why , captain , are you here in london , at har then ham ? " his brows drew together . " why is there a village not miles away , near oxford ? " "
[811/1000]	" there 's a certain amount of control involved , " said william , pushing his chair through the gap . " you also need to understand that the kaiti ans have developed a strong gravitational pull on the small
[812/1000]	he walked over to her and smiled . his heart soared . he wanted her . her body writhed with need as he reached out to cup her breast . it still hurt and he gently moved her hand to
[813/1000]	" i 've never heard such a deep , clear voice in my entire life , " he said . i smiled . he was a quiet , thoughtful man , one who would keep himself very young .
[814/1000]	and then the next thing i knew , i was climbing onto the bed to lay with lucas against the cool white wall of the armoire . i 'd put my clothes in my bag the day before to get
[815/1000]	" i 'll be heading out . should n't be long . " " thanks , " jessica said . he nodded , headed out the door . jessica moved to follow him ; he turned and looked
[816/1000]	i shook my head again . i felt no tears , but i was shocked by what i had just seen . i looked up into his eyes , and his tears were falling down onto mine . "
[817/1000]	' we should stay in touch , ' he said . ' after all , you agreed to meet me first , right ? ' ' yes , ' she nodded . ' but - ' ' but
[818/1000]	he pressed deeper and held me even tighter because he knew i could n't pull away . " that 's it , sunshine . i 'm going to taste you then we 're going to hit town while you take
[819/1000]	" of course , " he muttered , letting the words fall from his mouth . the look on her face was enough to make him shudder - because he 'd spent the last twenty - four hours remembering
[820/1000]	" do you have that computer i 've ordered in ? " " i 'm afraid not . " " good . i need to get a copy of the tapes from that tape . " "
[821/1000]	i grabbed the door handle . " why are you following me , too ? " he gave me a blank stare . " in case my dad decides to call again . guess i wo n't be visiting
[822/1000]	" what did i just hear ? " his mother was speaking to me from the passenger seat of my car . i could n't help but let out a giggle as she walked right up to me - not
[823/1000]	" yes . " " you do it . " " okay . " " so you are not going . " " yes . " " you will do it . " " i
[824/1000]	" i 'm not too concerned that she 'd be disappointed , " hunter said . " what we 're worried about is that we 're going to have to do something about this place . " " i
[825/1000]	" well , see if you can find out anything . " " i will . thank you . " he picked out a pen and a pad of notebook paper from the nightstand . he glanced out
[826/1000]	" no , i ... i ... " he let out a harsh breath . " yes , you did , " melissa cooed . she leaned over and nibbled on his jaw , enjoying the feel of
[827/1000]	" and after we start , " he said . " if you want . you can choose if you want . we can all get past it . i think you should choose . you just are n't sure
[828/1000]	" it could n't have been that hard , " she said . " i was really weak , i think . " " you 'll be fine , " he said . " we ca n't stop now
[829/1000]	" to be honest , i 'm not really sure , but you and dylan and i are - " " with more money than brains , " dylan added before he could stop himself . " that
[830/1000]	" yes , sir . it 'd be a first for me , too , " he said , his tone a smile , though he had no smile at all . " how old are you ? "
[831/1000]	he had to walk up to a man standing over an unconscious body dressed in leather . it was then that he looked down and realised that this was definitely a boy who worked with him . when he
[832/1000]	" why ? " i whispered , pressing my cheek into his warm , muscled chest . " because he 's still going to leave me for her , jenna , " he promised , his mouth moving against
[833/1000]	he chuckled aloud at how he now thought of this little lady as a love of the wild - game . even less so now that he knew she was not going to join the team . even with the
[834/1000]	" why do n't we take a stroll ? " he asked . they pushed through one of the huge open gates . " that 's just what i need to take my mind off my troubles , "
[835/1000]	" a mistake , " he says . " i 'm an ass * * le . it just happened . ca n't look fast enough , and it wo n't always be easy . " " look at
[836/1000]	" why ? why would you hurt my family ? " " i 'm not sure . but i did keep track of your family . " " now i 'm curious ? " he 'd had
[837/1000]	" then why are you here ? " she asked again . " why ca n't you go back to your own life ? " she glanced at the picture behind me and the image blurred . i could
[838/1000]	" they 've already found one , " she said . " it was over eight inches in diameter . my office does n't have fancy technology , but there 's one sitting right in the door . "
[839/1000]	because they 're here . a moment later , he heard footsteps and could tell that they were coming up the walkway behind him . he was n't surprised . his instincts were much too acute . a long
[840/1000]	' yeah , i know , ' i said . ' this is n't like me . ' ' i get it . well , just do n't go home . okay . ' he nodded gravely . '
[841/1000]	" i bet . " she laughed as she slipped in the front door . it helped , because she could see where sam was going to finish reading it . " i 'm working on a project for
[842/1000]	i could n't respond to that . " no , i wo n't answer any more questions . " " good girl . you 're a good girl . " " i think she 's asleep ? "
[843/1000]	" i will explain how we met , " he says , " but i still have two conditions . you will leave us alone from now on if you can . " there 's a long pause .
[844/1000]	my mom laughed . " i still want to - " " this is n't a contest , " she said . " besides , he still thinks you look , like , at least the size of
[845/1000]	" you do n't want to be a vampire . " " of course i want to . " " and yet you 're afraid . there 's something about being a vampire in the world that affects
[846/1000]	i waited for a response from her , but her eyes stayed fixed upon the road . i thought she was afraid to speak , that she thought i was lying to her or she was n't so sure .
[847/1000]	" i called him , " she said , turning to him . " i went over it with him and decided that the best thing to do here is tell him why i do n't want to see him
[848/1000]	i 'd wondered , was i hallucinating in my sleep , when i felt him lift my left hand in his . it had been so slight yet felt solid ; so heavy , like a child 's hand ,
[849/1000]	" what 's that ? " she says to me , as we go back out onto the stage . i 'm feeling slightly numb . " never mind . " he taps my hip with his index finger
[850/1000]	" a perfect wife and a mom , " he said , his face flushed with pride . " i have two brothers , and they do n't understand me . they take me into their home and love me
[851/1000]	" there 's an air - conditioning unit in my office , " said gerald . gerry , who seemed to be an expert at reading the signs of anxiety in the body of every person he found in
[852/1000]	" no thanks , captain ; i 'm afraid i believe i can safely say that i 'm not really a fan of living in england , " replied james with a smile and then , " will you please
[853/1000]	" i would say that the time i was with the black coven they convinced me to listen , " seth grinned . " i would agree with them on that particular point . i would say that we will
[854/1000]	i 'm not scared , and i do n't care . he wo n't hurt me . i 'm not scared . he takes her hands and kisses them . " i love you , daisy . please trust
[855/1000]	" maybe it 's not such a bad idea . maybe it 's what your father said about you already , " he offers hopefully . i get a little confused about his tone , and i have no
[856/1000]	" this is why i decided to go to israel . " we were out on the road for at least half an hour - mostly sitting by one of the side windows and with the radio playing like
[857/1000]	" no , " she replied . " i should n't trust you . " he tilted his head slightly , his eyes fixed on her lips . " i am very curious about this other thing you said
[858/1000]	he gave me a lopsided grin and licked his finger . oh , holy shit . the way his lips curved , making dark shadows beneath his eyes , made his entire body quiver with the need to kiss me
[859/1000]	if she had n't wanted to live her life as best she could , she might have thought him crazy sometimes . instead , she found herself telling her sisters that they did n't have to deal with him just
[860/1000]	" not real , " i say flatly , my mind beginning to spin with all the assumptions i 'm setting in motion . " she 's not like me , " he says . " then she
[861/1000]	" good luck today if you 're scared , " mrs. watson said with a small chuckle , while turning to run back into the house . " why has n't she called ? " i asked , following
[862/1000]	" all right . " alex sighed . " if you 'll get dressed . " " the baby stuff is over in the closet . i 'll put it in there ... " " i 'll get
[863/1000]	" how long ? " he asked , moving his hands over her body and feeling again the tremors that were causing her body . " for over three years , " she gasped out . he chuckled
[864/1000]	" i need the night off . " she pulls her phone from her back pocket . before i know it , i 'm following her into a long , dark living area with open doors to windows and couches
[865/1000]	" who are the two guys ? " " wait . the big one . " what would we do if he was on the move ? we could n't let the others know , so we 'd have
[866/1000]	" to you , " he said , and his voice was only a little hoarse . " i ca n't tell you the story myself , or i wo n't say it . but do you know , i
[867/1000]	they could follow him from the edge of the forest . there was nothing else to do but to wait . chapter twenty - eight the following afternoon , the sun emerged through the thick blanket of fog
[868/1000]	though it was his home , he felt a sense of duty to his home . and the fact that the room - and the people he knew there - were the ones he had been forced to put off
[869/1000]	" no one knows anything . " " you 're the one who brought up that damn police report ! " they both turned around , facing the guard . " you need to find some kind of
[870/1000]	" the last time you tried , it almost ended with you on a bed with another woman . " " jesus . " she put her hands round his waist , and her fingers slid up under his
[871/1000]	" i do n't think i 'm ready to hear what my own parents think about me . " " you 'd rather listen to your boyfriend ? " i said , completely bemused . " you know
[872/1000]	" i 'd be very glad to help you , " i said , and wondered if i 'd ever feel safe again . after quinn got off the phone , quinn told me that the plan from this
[873/1000]	" i had nothing to do with it , " he retorted , still staring over my shoulder , his hand on my shoulder . i frowned at the sight of him , and in a rush of embarrassment
[874/1000]	he dropped the mask and they continued down the stairs . as they reached the main floor the guards stopped outside their cell . " sir , i just heard something break in here . " alex let out
[875/1000]	" how does it feel , your grace ? " asked the red - cheeked maid who 'd escorted him to the room he was sharing with his brother . " like a corpse , thank you . "
[876/1000]	on their way home , they stopped at a light , they had almost finished their journey to the lake and were just getting home when a sudden crash , as if a thousand voices hitting all at once ,
[877/1000]	" yes , " she admitted in a low voice . " i am . " her hand tightened upon his arm , and so , though she had hardly touched him , she seemed to recognize him and her
[878/1000]	" you gave me no choice . i 'll be back for the weekend . " " i 'm sure you will , but there 's something i did n't tell you about . your baby is going to
[879/1000]	" you have no idea what 's happening to me . " " i realize that . but this is no time to dwell on it . " " you said the sun is rising ! "
[880/1000]	" i know they are in a secure location , " she said . " some of the soldiers have gone to stand guard while i make my move . " the door was open , and the light
[881/1000]	she glared at him . " and why do you think mr. har greaves will be mad if he finds out you 're looking for the key to his throne ? " " how do you know he 's
[882/1000]	and we all knew it . " i thought about asking you to marry me , but we already have a pren up , and i think i 'm pretty much tied to him , so it takes some work
[883/1000]	my words make him feel like a douche , but he holds on until i release . i shake my head , turning to walk away . his hand drops from my shoulder and i turn back to him .
[884/1000]	he put his hand on my arm before i could pull away . " cora - " i leaned into him , my hand at his chest , my lips at his ear . " i do n't
[885/1000]	" are you sure ? " the woman 's accent was a mixture of scand in avian and french . " i am a woman who has suffered on the road for many years . i have suffered so many
[886/1000]	as when when mom 's mom died , you 'd learned in the beginning that i was " my little girl of the year " and that whatever went through my mom 's head might , if nothing better happened
[887/1000]	" take hold of it ! " i yelled . i got my arms under my body and used them to push myself to my feet . i stumbled backward and slid toward the corner of the room ...
[888/1000]	" what do you mean by that ? " " if your love for your friends has a negative effect on you over the years , then how can you help them ? " there was a long
[889/1000]	" with a human , they are only one , but they are better at reading themselves in mirror image , while i am just not that . even when they are humans , they do not , at first
[890/1000]	i stood up from the couch but left the laptop on the floor in the library . " do you think mom would ever look at a picture of me ? " " i think so . "
[891/1000]	he must be one tough guy to be such a pansy for not believing me when i told him i was alive . i 'm sorry i 'm such a pansy you would be so cool and did n't believe
[892/1000]	he stepped away from me and cupped her face in his hands . " you 're going to be fine . i promise you that . " she wiped her nose and it came up wet . " i
[893/1000]	" right . " " you 're the best , " she murmured . " i want to do the same . i ca n't decide if i 'm more scared or more ecstatic . " he kissed
[894/1000]	" are you , uh , is someone planning on setting off an explosion at my house ? " the woman laughed . " naw , it 'll be fine . " she walked over to the sink and
[895/1000]	" can we just go home ? i could get used to these people . " " yes , " i said , " with two full loads of presents . i promise , i 'll buy you more
[896/1000]	it was all right . " i 'm not lying . i never want you to think i was the bad guy in this . i want you to know that i regret not being there when you needed me
[897/1000]	we 're on our way downstairs to the shop . the shop 's been shut up for weeks and everybody is now working except us . we load bags from its owner , the two security guards and the car
[898/1000]	' then i do n't see why you 'd come for me . ' she laughed . ' i came to apologise for my behaviour at school . that 's why i came here . my parents think i
[899/1000]	" i do n't know what happened . somehow i just know without a doubt that you 're not my baby sister . " " thanks , sis . " i hugged her for a few more seconds and
[900/1000]	we drove the few hours from the airport to jfk to a large car park . " the two of you go on one of the three flights to manhattan , " i told them , and immediately noticed
[901/1000]	" you know what i mean , " i said , not wanting to voice my feelings when he looked at me like that , " i mean , the others . i do n't know what i 'd do
[902/1000]	" this is your mess . if you do n't clean up , i 'll do it for you . " " your ass is in it . " he nodded . the corner of his mouth twitched
[903/1000]	everyone in the house looked up . " all right , " she said , nodding . then she said , " my name is sophia . my husband is jack . this is my husband , jack , and
[904/1000]	" can we get out ? " the two of them helped me up , and i staggered a little as pain ripped through my back . the car 's engine started up for just a second ,
[905/1000]	" not just anyone . his name , by the way . but why should i tell you that ? " he had n't said anything about her little affair with robert . he just wanted her hand in his
[906/1000]	" and i care about that . " a soft chuckle rumbled in his chest . " but if you 're thinking on leaving for london because of something i asked you to do - " his hand curled along
[907/1000]	" you guys get back together ? " i ask . " i know , right ? and i think we were both wrong about that , " jase starts , laughing . when candace comes out into
[908/1000]	" i have heard of you , my boy . " " i do n't know , " i answered honestly , " but i have come to learn that it is difficult to stay away from trouble .
[909/1000]	" yeah . " " okay . i 'll keep her safe . come off your high horse . i do n't care if i 'd give her up . she 's got a purpose here . do you
[910/1000]	" yeah , i can manage . you can go back to sleep . " " no ! " we both froze when the door opened from outside , echoing through the small room . we both jumped
[911/1000]	a hand touched his shoulder and he turned toward it . there it was , the shape of the ghost , gone , its eyes now shining through thin slits . ' i 'm afraid that is all
[912/1000]	' does this sound reasonable , sparhawk ? ' berg sten asked him . ' it probably sounds what it sounds . are you sure you can do it ? ' ' i have the memory and the
[913/1000]	" i think you know what i want , baby . would you like that ? " her head nodded . " oh , yes . " i released her and then i pulled her and placed her
[914/1000]	" and i see there 's just that . " she put her hands on her hips , her voice slightly breathless . " look , i 'm not interested in going with you . " i could
[915/1000]	" get me the name of the first guy you met who gave you any clues ? " " no sir , he never did . i did n't think he knew me . " " well i
[916/1000]	" you know ... " but i could n't say it out loud because it was written all over her face . so i just shrugged . " and as a result , jake black will be facing
[917/1000]	his nostrils flared . all of a sudden she felt herself being dragged against the bars . she went weak at the knees . " we must escape from here . we have no other choice . "
[918/1000]	her blood boiled and she sprang to her feet , her face pale . " sorry , ma'am , " said james . " i did n't mean to frighten you , but i did n't know you were
[919/1000]	" actually , not the best . maybe too much . and i do n't know . all i 've tasted through the year was coffee and chips . i 've slept only a few nights a week since we
[920/1000]	" let 's talk and get this over with . thank you , alex . " " do n't thank me . do n't mention it even to yourself . " " do n't you ? i suspect
[921/1000]	this whole episode just went pear - shaped . do you remember the time i had a few days off early because i had to take a call to my boss . that phone call never got patched , and
[922/1000]	" come on , i have n't seen yours before . " i 'd played it straight to get in to the movie , the one where you had to fake an orgasm ( well , technically that part
[923/1000]	a moment later - his legs pumping - the thing lurched from the ground , one long arm reaching up , ripping open the side of the cabin . gray was half - out of the plane and closing
[924/1000]	" that would be bad . " just when she was ready , though , they pulled onto a gravel road and came to a gravel parking area of some kind . a small white wooden house dominated the
[925/1000]	" do not let him think he has to make excuses to me . he knows as well as i do that a few decisions have to be made about whether or not he will honor his bargain with mr.
[926/1000]	i pulled the door open and stepped inside without looking back at my friend . it was too much like this . i wanted to go to ari and beg her to stay . why could n't she just
[927/1000]	i stared at him as he gave a deep laugh , clearly amused by me . " no , this is n't funny , either ! " i said , trying to hold back the laughter . but no
[928/1000]	" you believe everything you read in the newspaper and seen on the television . " " i guess . " i left her to get more food . " the police are here , " she
[929/1000]	" it was a good lesson , " tristan said . " the young man gets out just as fast as the adults , and when he gets out , he can run in circles for a good while to
[930/1000]	" you 're being nice . " " what did he like best about it ? " " just the company . " " because i asked you . " " no . " she
[931/1000]	' well , it just so happens that after i take it from them , i was in this car that was full to capacity with another passenger , ' she said , and proceeded to tell me the car
[932/1000]	when he finally spoke , his voice came out a few hoarse notes . " who would do that to a kid ? " " i do n't know . maybe someone ... " he did n't finish .
[933/1000]	" yeah , see you . " i hung up before he could reply . i was so mad , i could n't remember my own name . i was in shock , and if someone showed up threatening them
[934/1000]	" sorry , no chance . it 's just that ... just i did n't want to keep the company but i guess i had to . i 'm still tired . " " this is n't the party
[935/1000]	i started to step away . " there is no place more comfortable than in your bed with bed sex ! " he said , his eyes not leaving mine . i was instantly , fervently a little
[936/1000]	" yeah , i know . " he laughed at his own joke . " her job is pretty boring . plus , it 's so much harder to break a guy 's heart than to let him get with
[937/1000]	he put the car in drive and headed out of the driveway . she watched him as they drove away from the house . then , knowing she still was n't over what tom had said , julie let
[938/1000]	" you 'd better not . " he stepped forward to capture her hands in his . " i still do n't think you have the right . " his thumbs brushed lightly over her knuckles , and his touch
[939/1000]	' of course it 's not about your clothes , ' she agreed on a sigh . ' it all depends on how you look at it , ' he said , his mouth curling wickedly behind one eyebrow
[940/1000]	" i do n't remember them , " she said , suddenly alarmed , pushing his head away . " what if we had n't learned about that ? " " it 's not mine . " "
[941/1000]	he closed his eyes for a moment as they searched his mind , searching for any connection with his last wife . his fingers reached into his jacket . there was nothing . it was a simple gesture of gratitude
[942/1000]	my breath caught as his grip tightened . the weight of him on me intensified . i opened my eyes once the first flare began , feeling his pleasure fill the empty rooms . " a little , "
[943/1000]	he was looking out the window . " honey - " he leaned toward her , a little too close . " i knew you would n't ... last night , i knew it was going to be
[944/1000]	" what about the child ? did you hear from your father ? " " i left a message a couple of times , but it went straight to voicemail . " what a damn waste to have
[945/1000]	" what ? " she glared at him . " i 'm a lawyer , you know that ! " " what ? you like to steal ? or do you like to sleep with your men ?
[946/1000]	" the devil keep away from , <EOS> the devil keep away . the almighty take the devil back . he has seen that it is good to be alive , to be loved , to have love in sickness
[947/1000]	it was a struggle to get up . my head started to bleed from the beating i received , but the sharp sting made me fight back the urge to stop . finally , i could n't take it
[948/1000]	" and what about your family ? " my father was demanding . i looked at him , unsure . " i know this has turned out to be a difficult decision . it 's just not about
[949/1000]	" i got all my stuff . i 'm going to have the limo pick me up . " " i 'm coming with you . " " you 're making up excuses . you 're not bringing
[950/1000]	her voice was quiet but very firm , as if she had to warn me off getting hurt . " no , you wo n't be , alex . i have the power to make you strong . i -
[951/1000]	" it 's going to be okay . " she sniffled . " i 'm sorry . " tears rolled down his cheeks . " it 's okay . i 'm glad it 's okay . "
[952/1000]	" he hates everyone , to say nothing of a little bit of jealousy to you . " " jealousy ? " " i have n't mentioned it , and your father would rather have ignored it as
[953/1000]	on your knees - for whatever reason - or whatever it was you were doing in there , i was n't going to argue . hell , i did n't even want to <EOS> just then ; i wanted it
[954/1000]	when i left , several armed guards approached me , and i told them who i was . i began to cry in earnest as i approached the man . ' do n't fear , my dear lucy ,
[955/1000]	" that sounds good , " i said . " it 's really good . how many days do we have ? " that was the moment when i was n't the least bit curious . i was more
[956/1000]	" you saw to it they did in three weeks , " she said over a mouthful . her throat popped , and her eyes filled with tears . " it was really strong , " he said .
[957/1000]	" see ? " she lowered the weapon and looked up at him with wide eyes . " you 'd rather i shot you , " she said . " no , " he said . " i
[958/1000]	the man looked at him curiously . " where 're your manners ? " " sorry , sir , " replied jeff . " i 'm a little scared to see how fast it will take your ship to
[959/1000]	but <EOS> looking into the attic . " how much is this you 're feeding me . " " i guess we 're all making up , " she said . " you 're letting me help you in
[960/1000]	his head did n't move . the lights in the room seemed to flicker with his breath ; the sound made him long for being so close with the body to him . the door burst open , and
[961/1000]	" i 'm not in the mood , " victoria growled , her chin lifting and her eyes flashing . " victoria ! " miranda reached out to his fiancee , her fingers spla ying against his chest until
[962/1000]	" no , no , " he said . " i 've seen it at the hospital . she 's been through a lot , and i ca n't be the one to interfere . " i wanted to
[963/1000]	" do you mind if i <EOS> ? " i whisper until my phone . " i 'm not trying to figure out a way to the kitchen . i 'll fix our names . maybe ? " i
[964/1000]	she took a deep breath and relaxed . still there were still too many issues . at least one day she would be able to sort through them and have a normal life again . but what about her
[965/1000]	" all done now , " she told him . " what else can i say ? " " does n't he know you 're going to stay ? " david asked quietly . " he does ,
[966/1000]	i smiled as we watched him walk up the stairs to his room . my smile faded . i hated lying to aiden . it was so much easier to stay in his arms now that i understood those
[967/1000]	" she has n't run from me yet . " " is n't that the truth ! " " oh , but she has . have n't you heard ? she 's terrified . " " i
[968/1000]	" i 'm not supposed to talk about it , you crazy bitch . but you said you read about it in books and i believe you . " i laughed . she glared at me again , and she
[969/1000]	1 dried 1 stopped 1 walked 1 ran 1 shifted 1 stopped 1 fell 1 long 1 slipped 1 made 1 opened 1 other 1 started 1
[970/1000]	" just go upstairs and check with her . " he nodded , grabbed his jacket and stalked to the stairs . i just stared at the door . it was n't really my problem , okay ,
[971/1000]	" stop . " he does n't take his eyes off the road , but at least he looks at me . " i like what i see . it 's an accurate picture , too . most of those
[972/1000]	" all right , let 's get prepared to go on ! " shouted the pilot . " we 're about thirty miles from the land bridge now . the water we 're coming in on is seven feet deep
[973/1000]	" yes , but sometimes you just walk around , do n't you ? do you go out ? " he hesitated , then shook his head . " sorry , sweetheart . i was out , and things
[974/1000]	the one with the knife was sitting on an empty crate and was smoking a cigarette while his companion had n't finished . at my side , the men watched me curiously . finally the man in the dark
[975/1000]	he followed him around the room and stopped in front of the large screen . the air vent on his side of the room was now open . " it 's a window , " said tom , "
[976/1000]	" i 've got one for her and me . ' cept we 're in here now . but i like you . you 're a good guy , " the trucker said . " you got three choices
[977/1000]	no wait no . this was totally different . i 'd never done this before . my finger rubbed against the button of his pants . " go at once . " in a speed that was even
[978/1000]	" you think that if you do n't hear a single whisper , you 'll believe it ? " his features tightened . " i 'll just have to pretend i do . " " in other words
[979/1000]	we 'd been to see a film we had when i had a bad grade . it was great and we had a nice time . i kept my eyes on her as she danced with someone else 's boyfriend
[980/1000]	and then the light went out . the shadow of a man was now in front of me and looking straight at me it was a little boy . " my name is ian , " said
[981/1000]	' do you remember what he said to me today 's book ? ' i said . what he said ? yes . ' i do n't think i did , ' she said . ' and all i
[982/1000]	" i 'm sorry you got your first experience of sex with all male strippers , " i said . he came up behind me , circled my hips , and thrust me against his thigh . i felt the
[983/1000]	" is he here ? " " yes . " " and not with you ? " " he is on vacation , i believe . he should be back . " we stood alone in
[984/1000]	he stood up in one fluid motion and walked out of his own office , throwing the door open . " the damn thing is locked . " i said nothing , but his eyes moved to the deadbolt
[985/1000]	the men were all well aware of what had happened with the woman 's face of death , even now ... suddenly , he heard hoof beats . he turned suddenly , and saw a horseman running back to
[986/1000]	one of the younger men saw the men and started to rush towards them and the younger men just closed in again . unfortunately for him there was no opportunity to use his sword against the two . the
[987/1000]	" oh my god , " she whispered . " she kept it , " i whispered back , my throat tight and my eyes blurry . " for you . " " for us , honey
[988/1000]	while it was not a great turn of events , it was not a great waste for me to return to my own village with hope . if a brave new man had seen me in a torn and filthy
[989/1000]	" no ! " " fine , for your information , i 'm leaving . " his back was to her as she spoke but she was still running her hands through his hair . he turned toward her
[990/1000]	" sorry , honey . i guess i 've been really busy , with work and on - " he cut her off with a soft kiss . " no need to apologize . now get some sleep ,
[991/1000]	" this is the last time , remember ? the first and best , " i warned her , " but you need to remember when a woman decides to go and leave you without a word . "
[992/1000]	' i do n't want to leave him . ' ' i wo n't let him go . ' ' there are n't any other options , jess , and that 's a fact . ' '
[993/1000]	" and now that you 've seen the real me ... i told you how i want to spend the rest of your life . " i laugh , and it is both painful and sweet . if only
[994/1000]	" they should n't , " he murmured to himself . turning away from the window , he glanced over at where a tray of food was set on the table , topped with a few pieces of toast .
[995/1000]	she smiled . " it 's better than any bar i 've stayed at . we did n't talk much , just wanted to get to know each other a little better , and then i was bored . she
[996/1000]	' i told you . i am looking for a lady that i think would fit your description . she was also looking for a gentleman , one i believe , but i honestly do n't know which one ,
[997/1000]	" have i ? " he muttered , not finding any insult in it . " had the same luck . " he turned and headed backward down the hill , but did not go further until he was safely
[998/1000]	' they 're at it again , ' she said . ' you 're going all out with me for a change , and i 'm all prepared to do things myself . i can pull it off . '
[999/1000]	but the truth is you ca n't , either . not really . the truth is you ca n't , are n't the only ones who have never dealt with anything like this . you do , though ; you
