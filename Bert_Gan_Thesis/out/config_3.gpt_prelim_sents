[4/1000]	after they loaded the car with the family bags and bags of supplies , they dropped jack 's father 's things off at the front door and headed toward the car . jack noticed that his parents were looking at

[10/1000]	i ca n't help but smile . ' well , i definitely think i 'll go and see all the other ladies , find out what they think i 'm up to ' says amy . ' and

[12/1000]	" yeah , but i did say what i was going to say anyway ... you 've seen him . " by our end , she has a healthy and nice looking son and daughter . good riddance .

[14/1000]	" i heard . i thought you said it was more than a rumor . " he looked me up and down , his eyes assessing . he turned off the water and reached for his robe . "
[15/1000]	her fingers tightened on his shirt . she forced her fingers to loosen the buttons on his back . the woman was an idiot . oh , god , he really was going to f * * king die
[16/1000]	he moved too fast for me to stop him , but he had n't fully moved with us when he found the kitchen . he knew how to guard his weaknesses , however . once he had his hands on

[24/1000]	" and why the plan of one more man ? " she went quiet . not that he was expecting a response . " since we 're talking about me , " he told her in a small
[25/1000]	" it is nice , yes . i have received reports of new species , and much of it is very useful , although i could do with new bio syn th models , perhaps with you , to help

[30/1000]	he had n't been told the things she 'd said , even though it was obvious to him that they were true . <EOS> very , it was a life with more than that , it had to do

[35/1000]	" i do n't know . " " why should i believe you ? " she stood and walked over , pushing his desk aside . she slipped out of her shirt and slipped it on over her head
[36/1000]	" that 's why i 'm here , " he said . " why ? " " because you need my help . " " there is no help for me . " " and you
[37/1000]	" this is what you do in your dreams , " said the voice , still very loud in my ears . " all you need is to sit up and look dead . " i wanted to reply
[38/1000]	" so if you are reading this then i would guess you have been enjoying every minute of our time together , right ? " he sat up . " yes i am , " i said , "
[39/1000]	" i ca n't stay here , mrs. whitaker . i 'm sorry . " she smiled wearily . " it 's okay . what 's taken you so long ? i 've been wondering . " "
[40/1000]	they needed to get out of here . the air around them began to shimmer . there was a deep rumble . with that , jake felt the weight of the walls begin to rise around them . below
[41/1000]	jake nodded . he wanted to leave . " no need to . they 're not worth it , anyway . " before she could respond he moved into the hall , knocking at the door . " hey
[42/1000]	" go right ahead , mr. morrison . i know the drill . " he began walking at once , his feet moving like a heavy tread . when he approached the elevator , he turned back to
[43/1000]	i know what you want to do , but it 's not going to work . " " okay , " i said . " i 'll change . " i ran out to the kitchen and stood
[44/1000]	then when i finally returned home by car , only one human remained . i passed him as i walked up the pathway to school , not glancing back . " where have you been , ivy ? "
[45/1000]	" i 'll miss him , " she said . " i 'll bring you out here when the time is right , and you can come see him , " he said , sounding slightly more confident now
[46/1000]	* * * the next morning , after a fitful night 's sleep , i woke up alone - except for the two more girls . then i heard a soft tap at the door . i waited ,
[47/1000]	she could hear his heart pounding inside his chest , like it is for other , slower people . why am i here ? she does not recall doing anything of this sort . she hardly knows the stranger
[48/1000]	" are you all right ? " he asked . somehow that did n't surprise him . the girls and i had n't exactly been close on the playground yesterday and he remembered her being there , but did i
[49/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " says ryan . " it 's not what i want . " " i do n't know what you want , " i say . " let me think . " "
[50/1000]	" why are you doing this ? " " because i want to know you better . the more i know about you the better . " " that 's not a good beginning . you 're starting
[51/1000]	but now she knew . she remembered her father , her mother , her cousins ... every single person she knew in her family . they stood at the edge of the island where the lake was . she 'd
[52/1000]	" oh , yes , " said roger . " i 'll be right back , " she said , and went below decks . he heard the rattle and squeak of her tools as she turned up the
[53/1000]	" let me show you something . " he said as he led her toward the door . the door opened a few inches , and the large and sinister sight before them was the source of the pain
[54/1000]	" what do you mean ? " " you were talking about a man who has n't been there so long . that is the one you speak of before you are in this box . " "
[55/1000]	" what ? " i asked . " that 's why he 's never been one for it . he 's always liked to tell us stories about his life before he was kidnapped . " so that
[56/1000]	my eyes drifted shut as my fingers stroked my neck , then went to my throat , to the knot of muscle there . " good , " i said . " did i do better ? "
[57/1000]	" good . i 'm glad <EOS> always got rid of the other food . " i remembered things , as someone had been . " what was that ? i made , i 'd just had a bit ,
[58/1000]	" i 'll let you know . " " good . i will give that some thought tomorrow . please tell mom that we 'll be in touch and that we pray for her , " i said ,
[59/1000]	" his daughter ? " she said , shocked . " yeah , she probably did n't know . " i said , not feeling entirely sure either . " would n't he have had to tell her
[60/1000]	" yeah , yeah . just kidding . " she giggles to herself , and i ca n't help but smile . " what was that ? " i ask as she comes out into the cold . i
[61/1000]	" but you know that - you know he 's still my best friend . you knew he would n't turn to her for help ; you know he 'd want to be free . " he looked at
[62/1000]	a few moments later , he heard a thud , and then another . his mind filled with the scents of blood and spilled beer as the undead slowly retreated , the sound of their high , whining voices receding
[63/1000]	" what 's going on ? " he glanced away from me , his eyes flicking to my neck , where my clothes were drenched from his kisses . " was it a mistake ? " i asked
[64/1000]	" you can , of course . i would . of course i will . " julia giggled . " thank you . " " oh , julia , when i talk with you , i 'm not
[65/1000]	* * * * * " hey , sis ! " rachel smiled as she dropped the last of her things into her purse and walked out of the car . her mother walked over and put
[66/1000]	" i know ! i know , " i say . " i do n't have the guts . " " you have a choice , " sam assures me . " you can end up hating me .
[67/1000]	i have to laugh . i hear the sound of another car entering the parking lot . finally , a parking spot . a truck , the ones mom and i used to drive when we were in elementary .
[68/1000]	" we 're like a football team . we do everything alike . at least , that 's what mom thought like . i was like , ' who 's going to win ? ' and dad was just like

[70/1000]	" why ? " lucas asks . " i thought we 'd had our first discussion earlier today . " " about what ? " " how you thought i found my soul mate . "
[71/1000]	i moved to get another cup and the mug of scalding coffee . of course , when i looked outside , i saw her get into the car and slam the door . it was probably my imagination , but
[72/1000]	' how old was he ? ' asked bourne . ' he was an american , first of all ... oh , you know him ! you know him well , do n't you ? ' ' we
[73/1000]	" hello , mr. and mrs. du ha mel , " mr. and mrs. du ha mel said automatically . " how can i help you ? " " how are you today ? " he asked . he
[74/1000]	the queen 's head jerked around to face her , her hand coming up to stroke her full , red lips . " did i tell you we had guests ? " the queen 's eyes narrowed .
[75/1000]	mike 's eyes narrowed then they widened . he took a step closer to her and said , " well , what did i tell you ? " she made no reply , just blinked at him as she
[76/1000]	he shook his head , his expression pained . " you are the one , the one always a woman should have with a man that is a gentleman . " his grip on his staff tightened . " the
[77/1000]	" then what do you assume happened ? " " that was an accident . " " that or the death ? " " the latter , to be exact . we thought the same thing ,
[78/1000]	" so you have really hit it off ? " " yeah . " " that 's great . " i smiled at her , genuinely happy . " it 's not good news . " she
[79/1000]	his body tensed and it took every ounce of restraint not to jerk out of her . and then she jerked back only a few inches , her expression one of need . " oh , no ! "
[80/1000]	" i 'm really not into that kind of stuff , " i admitted . his gaze softened slightly . " then just ... think about it . i know i 'm kind of a dick . maybe it
[81/1000]	" your parents have been to see him , right ? " she glanced at me . " he 's the one who drove past on the road after i had the baby . " i nodded slowly
[82/1000]	to give her that in return . " does that mean i get to see the rest of your tattoo ? " " you get two at a guess , " he said slowly . " but yes
[83/1000]	she looked inside the box . it was a baby rattle , no more than eight inches thick . six pounds and seventy - nine ounces or so . it was simple . this was a baby rattle , nothing
[84/1000]	" just bring some money to the hospital . " i 'm sorry , " carolyn said , seeing the dismay on carolyn 's face . " do n't worry , " she assured her . "
[85/1000]	" when did you meet her ? " " early this morning . i was walking along the grounds of the school . " it was the longest moment of my life . she was sitting on a
[86/1000]	" i did n't do it , i swear i did n't , " steve insisted , trying to control himself . " sure you did , " jeff said . " you stole her phone . "
[87/1000]	" i 'm fine . " " maybe you should sit down , " i told him . " no . i mean , yes , i would . " he shrugged , but got up from the
[88/1000]	my fingers reach for his shirt buttons and i tug them off and discard them . oh my god , you 're amazing . he looks down at me , his eyes hooded . his lips peel back
[89/1000]	he could n't talk . his entire body felt like it would explode , but he could n't force his vocal chords to work either . he 'd just had the most powerful orgasm of his life . she
[90/1000]	" you probably ca n't tell from the phone number given by the guy on the register . " she let herself into the room and looked around . " any new stories tonight ? i mean , the ones
[91/1000]	his face softens and he stands up to his full height over me . he leans down and kisses me softly . " i 'll be back with every ounce of your energy . i promise . " "
[92/1000]	but it 's not like the old ones at all . they made a difference in the world , and they were in a position to help . i did n't think you felt like talking about my lack of
[93/1000]	" it 's a short list you 'll be getting . " " and you do n't think we should mention nothing about this ? " he shrugged . " not to my parents , anyway . they
[94/1000]	" uh , just a sec , i 'm just going to take my panties off , " heather said . how was she not wearing a bra ? i could n't see , either . i made my
[95/1000]	he nodded . he was a soldier , and he would n't leave his friends to suffer while they walked . " all right , then we follow your orders , " he said , turning on his heel
[96/1000]	he gave her the same shrug he 'd given the other men . " the problem now is , i ca n't give you your dreams . " that was n't what she 'd been expecting him to say
[97/1000]	it 's not worth the trip . but at least my family is safe . there are plenty of places i want to visit . i 'm not quite ready to get home yet , but i 'm sure i
[98/1000]	" not as many i thought were going to be . i 've waited until the end of the first war and even then , they used to make an exception for the weak one , too . "
[99/1000]	" the house of god ? " the lady 's eyes lit up . " you 're so clever , you do that . you 'll make a fortune off of it , i can feel it . "
[100/1000]	" what the hell are those ? " my voice was a whisper . " do n't you know ? they are n't real . they were never real ! and you are only going to use them .
[101/1000]	" it does n't matter anyway , " she said . " my parents are dead . " i was shocked . no one in my life had ever made me feel that way , that i would be
[102/1000]	" i know , i know , " she says . " but i ca n't quit school unless he allows me to . " " he 'll have to have me at a real job eventually , "
[103/1000]	he took her little purse and left the store without asking her if she wanted to go for food . chapter 2 after her confrontation with her ex , kate was feeling the pressure to move forward .
[104/1000]	" i am . oh , yes . you 're welcome . " i watched as she headed toward a small kitchen with a microwave oven and a fridge , where she opened a little cupboard . this kitchen
[105/1000]	if she wanted this , she was going to have to do it right ; and that meant taking another woman 's virginity . if she expected him to appreciate the value of a good f * * k. she
[106/1000]	" yeah . we did n't try . " " yeah . " she pointed to sam , who was pulling out the garbage and talking to a few kids . " he thinks it 's okay . he
[107/1000]	' are you sure that 's possible ? ' ' yes , but i 'd like to try something a little different . ' he took off his coat and draped it over the back of a chair .
[108/1000]	" your father is alive . " " who ? " i did n't understand why any of this was good news . the silence lengthened . " my father . you must be hungry . "
[109/1000]	her voice was steady and strong . " go , jack . " she felt he could do it . " keep the dogs in school . try to escape undetected . and keep looking to see if anyone 's
[110/1000]	that 's so not me . she leans in higher , and her breath tickles my face . i try to keep my hands from dipping back inside her dress and reaching for her tits , but i 'm
[111/1000]	" but . if you could explain it , now would be a good time . " " there 's a great point , and a bad one at that . you 've been talking with the man for
[112/1000]	" thanks , dad . what time are we going in ? " mia asked . " four - thirty should be perfect , " she mumbled from underneath her blanket . i was just about to shake
[113/1000]	" you mean , like , with a few million dollars ? " he asked after a second or two . i shook my head , still waiting for him to ask the question he wanted to know the
[114/1000]	" no , no . she 's actually sitting in the booth at a movie theater like everyone else . " " why ? it 's not like she 's planning to change her mind . she invited you
[115/1000]	she grinned at that . " i see . i did n't realize you were a man of these things . " she shook his hand and he winced as a pain shot up his forearm . " i 'm
[116/1000]	the others were watching her with questioning looks . oh , crap . she could n't help it . the tension was between her and ty . she and ty had been friends since high school . a kiss had
[117/1000]	" with our mutual friend the demon lord , even one under the influence can be drawn into temptation . most would be tempted . but none of you is strong enough these days . i fear we might be
[118/1000]	she looked to us , puzzled . her hands were covered in bright red dirt and sand , and she had dried blood all over it . " what happened ? " " no way . in the heat
[119/1000]	one of his hands stayed on the steering wheel . he 'd already said his sweet goodbye . he reached for her but she shook her head . he really had to back off . she was tired of feeling
[120/1000]	" was it ? " he held out a warm palm to her . " come on , we 're going to the lake . " * * * the boat was full of people by eleven
[121/1000]	she turned to peer at him . he was in a red pul lover shirt that covered his chest and a pair of loose khaki shorts . his face was cleanly shaven , with a dusting of light brown stubble
[122/1000]	" we 're all out of burgers , anyway . " " and i know exactly what you like , " cole added . " i 'm not hungry , thank you . " " well ,
[123/1000]	" that 's the point , yes . you have a little bit of power over people . " " i 've had it from everyone in my life . the least they can do is respect me .
[124/1000]	she rolled her eyes . " it 's just a tattoo . it 's completely cool . do n't take it personally . " " it just makes me think of how i want to do things with you
[125/1000]	i do everything , i know how to handle things . do you ? i 've found a position next to a guy who makes me feel free to go all weird . he makes me feel pretty awesome
[126/1000]	" that 's only because i live in the dorms . i get the bathroom so i can go <EOS> at night . i have this bad feeling about this house . " " i know that feeling .
[127/1000]	the black and white image flashed with something like anxiety , what did it mean ? what did the image mean ? the image faded , and the outline of a smiling face , not in a face but a
[128/1000]	i was feeling vulnerable and vulnerable and in a much better place than before , and i kept thinking that maybe i had been too trusting , and maybe we should have stayed just enough apart to find out less
[129/1000]	" that 's okay , " said coraline 's mother . " i have some soup , for coraline . and milk . " that night old mrs. dun wi ddy gave coraline and her mother an envelope full
[130/1000]	but now that cole had shown she did n't dislike him , it was hard staying angry with her . " you 're right . i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry . " relief swamped him .
[131/1000]	a shiver coursed through her . her n * * ples peaked in response . " i need to press my mouth on your clitoris , " he whispered . " if you can still feel it , you
[132/1000]	i heard his eyes close briefly . " who is she ? " he asked . i did n't know . i just knew that whoever she was , whatever it was , she was very powerful and
[133/1000]	the fire came back for him where he lay beside her . he felt weak , tired . he blinked , and opened his eyes and watched as a young woman in a white dress entered the room . he
[134/1000]	" i have no intention of talking to you again . " his words stung like metal against a fire pit and stole all reason from her mind . why do i feel this way ? she needed
[135/1000]	" i see ! we have learned so much . " " then should we be glad that this is the end ? " " i am not sure these young men will have sufficient guidance to accomplish
[136/1000]	" it 's not as if i 'm a secret girlfriend , " i lied . i could n't let her think that . her parents would diso wn her . i had been planning to say that i was
[137/1000]	her words hung in the air for a moment , and her features tightened into a hard line . finally , the woman looked up . her brown eyes burned into mine <EOS> even through my glasses . she
[138/1000]	with that , he turned away , stalked into his study and began to slam his door closed . he did n't think . he did n't know , but he reached for the doorknob , pulled out
[139/1000]	she gasped when one of her most intense orgasms hit . as soon as she felt the tension loosening , she dug another needle into her vein . she might have to wait another week . " that feels
[140/1000]	then i looked down at her on the bed . she looked totally naked and exhausted . i walked up to her and gave her a quick kiss on the mouth . " miss me , hmm ? "
[141/1000]	my hand instinctively went out before i realized what i was doing . i was going to grab her . i needed to grab her and hold her tight . but she remained stiff in my grasp . i tried
[142/1000]	" that ... is , " she started , her eyes glued to the front of the room , and then meeting his . " you are n't making any sense . but i had something else in mind .
[143/1000]	" his head looks like a f * * king potato sack . " shane was the only person i 'd ever been in there when i 'd broken bones or needed blood to heal . then shane had saved
[144/1000]	" no , she 's not . " he shakes his head the same way he used to as my little brother . " have n't seen her in days . maybe she 's scared to see you . "
[145/1000]	" how could someone know that ? " she asked , clearly confused . " just trust god , " i said . " but he does n't answer prayers . " " when you do n't
[146/1000]	i 'm a little intimidated by this guy , and he stares at me like he 'd rather eat me than ever look at me again . i have no idea what there is in him , or why he
[147/1000]	when i entered the house , dad 's face broke out into a huge grin . " i ca n't wait to see the girls , " he said . i frowned at peter , not really wanting to
[148/1000]	" did he ? " i asked . i did n't have an answer to that . after a moment , i shook my head . " there 's nothing you could have done , i guess . we

[150/1000]	i leaned for a moment on the hood of the car and let the rush of adrenaline flow . i did n't think our little escapa de would end easily , but if we had his car , then i
[151/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " i say , feeling that last , desperate tear rise from my eye . he nods . " good . " i watch it roll down his cheek and onto the top
[152/1000]	and what if it ever seemed more than that ? his voice was cool and distant . " a human would be dead without a soul the moment an angel stepped from a plane of existence to bring about
[153/1000]	another tear escaped . this one trickled down my cheek and i wondered why my eye would feel raw . i had never seen a tear so clear in all my life . i wanted a mirror , i wanted
[154/1000]	" shit . " she looked over her shoulder at him . " are you all right ? " " i 'm fine . " " you look worried . " " not at all
[155/1000]	the three guards returned to the other side of the small room to talk with several others . after twenty minutes , several more guards walked through the door , and another guard approached us . he had a face
[156/1000]	" there 's a rumor circulating in that area that he 's missing the talisman . " " what kind of rumor ? " " well , it seems there 's a rumour about two people being the

[159/1000]	she lifted her head from his chest and stared at him , with a look of confusion . " why are you still with me ? " just the simple question , her face was so soft on his chest
[160/1000]	" you believe in miracles ? " " what ? " he asked , and seemed confused . " you did n't believe in god . " he lifted his eyebrows slightly at this , and looked
[161/1000]	they walked along the hall toward the stairs . " your mother 's not around , is she ? " " no . is your father home ? " " no . " she 'd mentioned it <EOS>
[162/1000]	he looks slightly annoyed . " who are you ? " " i 'm your girlfriend . " he smiles . " of course . " i cross the room and sit at the end of the
[163/1000]	" that 's it , " he said , and thrust the door open again , shouting . she went out in front of him . he could keep her here at least until morning , but she was

[165/1000]	" so you 're saying that we 're going to be friends if we let me have you ? is n't the part about being friends really important ? " " yes . " " so why do
[166/1000]	' he has n't felt like himself lately . he 's also said his muscles are n't taking up very much of his mind . ' ' has he ? ' ' just since he got around to
[167/1000]	well ... sort of . i did get about fifteen minutes to make her cry . i never had to break her , did i ? " i 'll be right back . " i go immediately to the
[168/1000]	" i thought they said you were in hospital . " " not anymore , " she said , putting on the best fake smile she could muster . of course , even at her best she was n't
[169/1000]	and yet , as if someone had written the words , people like that did n't get around . he 'd seen them enough in the times they had crossed into everlost - but as he got closer to them
[170/1000]	" okay , " chris said , knowing that <EOS> chris ' only choice of topic was that he must pay <EOS> , but when the school , etc , anything . her memory of the moment , from what
[171/1000]	and at her words , he tensed , as if sensing her distress . " the power . " she tensed , too . though there was little that she could do with a ring . but she
[172/1000]	" you were at the party . " i said . " who told you that ? " " who else ? " " you 're an ass * * le . i do n't have to
[173/1000]	he went onto the stairs and paused . then he pushed open the door to the bedroom . the bed looked even less inviting than it had before he 'd spent the night . sleep had been scarce and he
[174/1000]	" that was , like , my best friend , sally , " danny explained , as if he was talking about a little girl . " and i think it was because he did n't want me to say
[175/1000]	" so we got lucky , " she said . " here is the guy ! " she opened up the door to his white and tan lexus . then she shoved the keys into his hand . " go
[176/1000]	" i am , indeed , " said lord vetinari . " ah , i am afraid i have a lot of un suitable people to thank for this opportunity , my lord . and i am sorry for the
[177/1000]	the waiter cleared his throat , a deep , clear sound that was n't unlike the sound of a wind chime playing in the background . " may i get you anything else ? " her pulse kicked up
[178/1000]	" i 'm not going to risk it , " i blurt . " what if he tries to call one of your work groups ? " " they would n't tell him where we are yet . they
[179/1000]	" that 'll be a no since you have an army . how did we do ? " he grinned . " i 'm more than happy to be back . " " oh , you are ,
[180/1000]	" come with us ! " she shouted , " please ! you have to join us ! " the woman looked confused and then smiled as the figure turned to look at her . " how do i
[181/1000]	it may sound old - fashioned and maybe even childish , but sometimes really good thinking works - it is an ancient concept that , even when we 're older than anyone else , our parents and sisters get to
[182/1000]	" thanks , i think ... but do n't worry about that . i know you better than you know yourself . it 's like being a mother . " chapter 24 the night that mark arrived at
[183/1000]	but the woman was talking to david in his sleep . david was dreaming of some long - dead woman with long white hair . the woman was holding a spoon and she was using it to drink his blood
[184/1000]	" it 's in the phone book , " she murmured , rubbing her temple with her hand . " we have n't gotten around to calling it two for an exact time , but we 'll get it .
[185/1000]	you wanted a normal life - to be around humans and vampires ? yeah , that 's what i am , and i want that . except i ca n't have a normal life . i 'm human . still
[186/1000]	' it is , ' said maurice . she shrugged again . ' right . now , remember , the queen said that my eyes do n't keep me from doing something to help you . ' '
[187/1000]	an unnatural warmth ran through her , one she did n't understand . that was n't normal . not during a condu ction . how he 'd come to be here , he did n't know . he was n't
[188/1000]	" you could tell me what i liked , " i said . " just as to what you like . " my throat tightened and something like pride surged up inside . i was giving in to my

[190/1000]	to the house of the dead in a swamp ; no one had known it would grow up so as to become a man . to the walls of the town of new york , still a city of three
[191/1000]	" yes , sir ? " " i may have something , for you to look at . " at first he showed no sign of recognition . at last he reached into a jacket pocket . his
[192/1000]	at last they reached the end of the field and an arrow - tipped arrow - tipped arrow - tip came hurtling out and whistled towards ian 's head . he stepped aside and picked it up with one hand
[193/1000]	" a problem with that ? you would allow your friend to commit murder ? " " well , no . " " that is odd . " " not really . " " she is
[194/1000]	" hey it 's me , you can shout loud enough . there 's something wrong , " i added , " something ... " " me ? ! " he asked aghast . " why would i be
[195/1000]	at this point , i 'm not sure what he wants . maybe he 'd like to hear some more about his job , me , work , any topic that will get me out of his head .
[196/1000]	" the last we talked , she was one of those crazy women i knew and loved and thought would protect me . she decided she liked your scent , so she set out to find you today . "
[197/1000]	" i 'm sure it will . " " you ca n't be sure . " " just be more aware , and it 'll be okay . " " thanks . " he reached out and
[198/1000]	" well ... yeah . " " i have a feeling there are things my wife wo n't let the rest of us do . " " she made a good start with the church , " i
[199/1000]	" one , you 're only sixteen years old and , two " , as the man continued speaking , <EOS> every emotion had been replaced by one of triumph , the kind with his voice , a voice rich
[200/1000]	" i should n't have stayed here . i should have stayed . " and so it was she went searching for the keys . " you had everything you could possibly want , " his brother told her
[201/1000]	" you want me to wait ? " jake asked , obviously uncomfortable with the question . molly ignored jake and looked at jake . " i 've got an appointment . " " a doctor ? you
[202/1000]	" wait ! " she screamed , then fell to her stomach next to me . when i rolled over , she was still alive . " can you stand ? " i asked . " i
[203/1000]	you are my entire world . i pray on occasion that they will succeed . we all know there is only pain . only grief . i look at my hand and remember my wife 's hand , the
[204/1000]	" we want nothing more to do with this ; and certainly you can certainly trust us to do everything we can to prevent such a thing ; and that is the nature which the sultan wants you to keep
[205/1000]	if she 'd found him , was he still alive ? i will love his daughter , she thought . she thought of their little cabin and the little pink bed they used to share . that was
[206/1000]	" wow , " he said , his voice low and quiet . " something strange is going on here . " i let the silence take us to another location . some place in the middle of
[207/1000]	" we are safe , " he repeated into my mouth . " yes , we are , " i breathed . " baby ... " he encouraged and i lifted a hand to cup his cheek .
[208/1000]	she was beginning to need that reassurance when an icy cold hand suddenly wrapped around her waist and pulled her against the length of him . she was shocked at the intimacy of her need . how could her body
[209/1000]	" do n't forget my name . " " we 're okay . i know i acted like an idiot , but i had no idea who or what that guy was , so i did n't try to
[210/1000]	" you know what it is . get out ! " " but we 're here to talk . " " yeah , not . leave , and you leave , and you leave . " she
[211/1000]	he could n't help but gaze at her face , with its full , expressive and oddly sensual mouth . she was the one thing about her that he could n't forget . if anything were to happen to
[212/1000]	" i 'm sorry , did i do something wrong ? " " not in the least , i guess you 're just an american . you thought to impress upon me how ' american ' you are ,
[213/1000]	" really , you do n't ? i 'd thought that with your abilities , you 'd have more tolerance , but i find that hard to believe . i 'd like to think that you would be willing to
[214/1000]	but why did n't he deny it because he knew that truth . " i lied when i said i was n't a vampire , garrett . you see , it was n't supposed to be like this .
[215/1000]	" does that mean you do n't want me to know ? " no , i know it does n't . it might make it worse for me . " no , i just - you have to go
[216/1000]	" hello he did . " that 's about the only thing that would've stopped anyone in their tracks . i did n't stop long enough for the man in the black hat to get a word in before
[217/1000]	" are you hungry ? " " sorry , we have n't been to ki mble for several days . we 're heading west . " she was n't sure her voice sounded more like the voice she used
[218/1000]	" i never knew you knew him , " she whispered . she stood on the other side of him and watched his fingers fold around the glass of chilled wine he 'd poured himself . " he was
[219/1000]	" oh , good , " dad smiles as he comes in . " are n't you all feeling all comfy ? " i ask . " we just got the house well built . everything is ready
[220/1000]	" who is this guy anyway ? " asked hacker . his blue eyes were wide and alert as he listened intently . " your friend and i are looking for leela , " i said , just as
[221/1000]	" tell me ... right now . " the words were out of her mouth before she finished the question and she had no clue why . it was n't a question that was her fault . it
[222/1000]	from her position on the ground she could see the back of the woman 's head , but the woman was n't close enough to get on a phone . they went down three steps , then three more
[223/1000]	" so , this trip , " charlie began slowly , " does we have what i need in china ? " mr. asher nodded . " i 'm afraid so . we can check that out then ,
[224/1000]	" for the same reason . everything you 're doing will be discovered by the other spies . " the key to failure is to keep the spy in line . that way no mistakes are made . we
[225/1000]	" i 've been fighting for my life , " he told her . " i doubt that , " she murmured . " can we not talk about this ? " he asked . " not
[226/1000]	my fingers clutched at it . i was n't ready . i did n't know if i ever would be . i missed a girl , and i missed her . but there was no other way to explain this
[227/1000]	" very good . " he kissed her again , longer this time , just as he 'd planned . then he eased away , his hands cupping her cheeks . " i need to kiss you again , "
[228/1000]	he smiled down at her . " look at me , love . " she did , and there was a warmth , a kind of life in his beautiful blue eyes . she should have been scared ,
[229/1000]	you give your parents some credit . they saw the wisdom of the test ... but you never failed . " " there 's so much more to this than what i 've shown you , " said reginald
[230/1000]	" this is my bed . " she touched the sheets , thinking of them as home . " why do you live here ? how did your parents afford this place ? " he did n't speak ,
[231/1000]	" what ? " charlie asked . " you said one of the men had called you . " " uh ... yeah . " " and you went to see him ? " " well
[232/1000]	" and this is what our history book tells us , " professor mad sen said . " each culture has a different concept of its own world . from our culture each culture has its own flavor of cultures
[233/1000]	" see what i mean ? " " yes . " " it 's different . " " how ? " " it 's a new thing . " " tell me about it .
[234/1000]	" why did you , how did you know about the house ? and the horse ? " he looked into the distance again , considering . " i went down to the farm ... " " oh
[235/1000]	" they can have all that stuff now ? " he knew from the looks on their faces that there were n't many options for them right now . he pulled out his phone and dialed sam . " let
[236/1000]	' have you already had your tea ? we 'll need to go back downstairs now . ' henry took her elbow to lead her out of the lounge , ignoring the door hanging on the arm of the
[237/1000]	it was almost midnight . i glanced at my dad as he made another pit stop . " are my parents home ? did you call them ? " " uh let me think about it . they
[238/1000]	" you 're here or you 're not . " " whatever . " that 's all . no change in his expression . " get your girl . " " what girl ? " i ask
[239/1000]	" wow , you 're really sweet . i guess you can do things without having to do <EOS> just like that , and that kind of stuff . " " did that too , " was the only
[240/1000]	" what 's so important ? " " the library . " " i can hear it , but i do n't want to hear it . " " would you trust me to show you ?
[241/1000]	the women were laughing . " you never thought it might have happened ? " she did n't answer right away . " no . i guess , " was all she said . " not the
[242/1000]	instead of making an apple pie like i typically made , i pushed past her , going to my room to watch some of my favorite movies and drown in my own self - pity . i had been so
[243/1000]	' you think that ? does that seem plausible ? ' i turned back to the door . ' that 's really a question . ' five minutes later he shook his head again and said again ,
[244/1000]	" it 's only been nine days , but he wo n't stop . he gets more of him every day . " " okay , go find him . " she nodded , turned on her heel
[245/1000]	" when we finally leave here , we 'll get to meet my friend , " the colonel said , as his arm started to move again . " what a nice kid he is , how she must be
[246/1000]	" and this is a business meeting , " the blond man said . " i guess it will all turn out fine . " the blond took the file , the kind of file you did n't check
[247/1000]	the guy , who was definitely a little older , walked over to the couch and sat on the other end of it , his butt just out of reach of the chair . he turned and looked at dean
[248/1000]	i tried to stay still , but that did n't help matters . how could i have been so careless for not knowing i was n't alone ? the guards did n't move . i said , "
[249/1000]	she pulled away from me , the way she had right before she slapped me . " we need to talk and about something important . " i waved her off . " nope . i 'm busy right
[250/1000]	" a girl who knows how to take care of herself . but this time , i think she is really smart . " " can anyone teach her how to make herself one ? " " not
[251/1000]	" oh , " she said , sounding like she already understood that . " i thought you were still at the restaurant ? " " i am . " " then why were n't you at the
[252/1000]	he was a bastard , and she was going to fight him for every second she could . he 'd been right he was an angry man , but he 'd been right to insist that she not go
[253/1000]	" no . i just . . . need to know if you are , uh . . . " he frowned , seeing the confusion in my eyes . did he have any idea how i reacted when
[254/1000]	" he must know who i am . " " does he ? " she leaned close enough for me to taste her breath that was as sweet as her words . i froze . " you must
[255/1000]	the following morning , an official , red - haired servant , a lady - in - waiting , showed sarah into richard delamere 's residence , an older lady who was n't much older than his mother .
[256/1000]	one of the first words i remember her saying was sex and me getting along . in theory , i guess she was trying to manipulate me . " you need to come . " she shoves me .
[257/1000]	it seemed that every morning the wind turned the air from mild winter cold to ice cold . the breeze also carried the sweet scents of pine needles and freshly fallen snow and from the rising of the sun that
[258/1000]	then , even though i was positive the light he provided was a trick , i made a mad dash by the truck . a hand clamped over me and jerked me to a stop . " stay right
[259/1000]	" please , do n't read that , " mrs. whitaker said . " your father would kill us both . " the guardian aunt kate 's dad had a stroke three years earlier , but the doctors
[260/1000]	she nodded , took the wine and then went into the kitchen to put on her makeup . " dinner shall be ready in a half hour , " david said as he crossed into the sitting room .
[261/1000]	her eyes drifted downward to his chest and she felt goosebumps appear there . he was a killer , after all . she had seen him in action - and taken some hits yourself . he was different .
[262/1000]	" yeah , " john agreed . " i need that guy . " " do n't forget that we still have n't identified the other suspects we took in here , " chris said to him . "
[263/1000]	" we could order pizza and watch a tv - " " or you could stop f * * king screwing your parents out of a cheap piece of shit car . those are your choices , honey .
[264/1000]	there was no time to take more than one shot before captain rack ham 's cry of pain sent the crew scattering in all directions . " the rope ! do n't you dare shoot it ! " rack
[265/1000]	' i do n't want the army to think of me as some sort of ' little girl ' . ' ' i do n't know , liz , ' he said . ' i was always going to

[268/1000]	but my body was numb and rigid . i stood for a moment studying her arms , which were wrapped in a black velvet shawl with a matching lace collar . i could n't breathe , then realized that
[269/1000]	" that 's not important . i 'm going to check my computer . " " i 'm not going to go anywhere . " " just come home , " i plead . " tell us what
[270/1000]	" you want him as much as i do . " i said not believing that so many people were convinced by what happened between us . " but we have to stop this , sam . he was
[271/1000]	oh , it was one of his more potent and effective responses , this primal warrior , this man with all his power and experience and patience , who was n't afraid to be who and what he was .
[272/1000]	" it 's perfect , " she said with a giggle . and she stood up the rest of the way and followed him across the room , a smile on her face . the other room was as
[273/1000]	" i do n't know how to do my stuff . " " you 've done it before , right ? " he was silent for a moment . " yes , " he said at last .
[274/1000]	" it 's kind of a long story , but basically that 's me being a douche bag . " my hand flew to my mouth . my breath caught when i heard chase 's voice drift through the
[275/1000]	i told him to get in a better mood . " i know you think i 'm just some girl who likes to dress up to impress , but i 'm serious there . i 'm here with my
[276/1000]	" just be careful ! " i said , shoving the glass of coffee into his hand before i got myself another cup . i had a feeling he was going to put this in some little box , or
[277/1000]	her gaze widened . " do you agree ? " " no , but i would rather you were one hundred percent certain , " he drawled . her mouth dropped open , her eyes taking on a
[278/1000]	" and if you 're an average sort of man with average social security , " she continued , " you should consider yourself lucky to have been born a very wealthy man . " " i do n't
[279/1000]	" this is good - bye , my little friends - our good friends - " i was at the door when she called me by it . she sounded weak enough to collapse on it before i could
[280/1000]	the king sat down in a large metal chair , and closed his eyes . he was not a regular human . that i knew , and i was n't surprised . i had no idea what day it
[281/1000]	" why 's that ? " he asked . they each shook their heads after thinking about it for awhile . " why do n't you tell him ? " she sighed . " i have n't spoken to
[282/1000]	but that meant she would have to decide now , did n't it ? would she turn over her own two feet to a stranger ? " and as far as i 'm concerned , i suggest you keep
[283/1000]	i raised my eyebrows and said - " do n't even look at me . " he ignored me . he took out what looked like his mother 's locket and held it up . it was tarnished and
[284/1000]	while i could n't tell for certain what it was , i knew that the light came away from whatever it 'd been . it was the closest thing to a fire i could see , and when some of
[285/1000]	" yeah , that s so i can go to mom and really apologize . i hurt her bad , but not much . but i want to prove her wrong , that she , at least , would get
[286/1000]	' and the rest of you . i said , " no . " " no " - you said , " let 's not make any trouble for the other side of the coin . " ' '
[287/1000]	" but you 're going to lose them all , and i ca n't be with you all the time . i ca n't go from being close to you to being locked up , afraid to see anyone again
[288/1000]	" we 're dead ? " the woman cried . " ah , not to my knowledge , " he said . " my dear , perhaps you could have some tea or tea ? " " yes
[289/1000]	" well , how about if i take you out and you let me go in my truck . i 'll take us somewhere nice . " she thought about that for a moment , then turned back to the
[290/1000]	mike had learned a long time ago that it was best to not push the subject when you did n't want to encourage a discussion . nor did he want any woman to try and pull him into a discussion
[291/1000]	he stared at her , his eyes full of pity . " it sure is , " he said , the words as flat as if they were the last thing he 'd thought she would hear . " i
[292/1000]	i nodded and pulled on her hand . " let 's get you inside . i 'm sure it 's freezing out here . " sarah pulled the door open and swung her legs out of the car .
[293/1000]	" she 's afraid of his brother , right ? " " no , she 's terrified of a possible demon , too . to be honest , i think she 's afraid , but not out of terror
[294/1000]	" then good luck with your new friend . " she raised her chin and walked away , taking her bag with her . that was it ? she expected him to make some comment , or give her
[295/1000]	" hey , i thought you 'd want something . " " yeah , i do . " she walked over and opened the box . she peered inside . " here . this is what i found after
[296/1000]	she looked at the little boy who had gone with her , then at the huge hands squeezing the bow . " there 's no use crying over an accident , " he was saying . " he 's
[297/1000]	" this one 's not very big , " she says , but her voice sounds kind of tight . " we 'll go with a smaller one . " a few seconds pass and then she agrees
[298/1000]	" you ? you have n't said anything to the police about it . " " it 's okay . i 've talked with the police myself . i knew when i got here that it was all fake
[299/1000]	" i 've never done anything . and i do n't plan on using my ' gift ' to harm anyone . " " never ? " she grinned . " never , and we 'll never have
[300/1000]	" go to work , " he ordered her before the call was disconnected . " now . " " yes , my master . " she grabbed her purse and his jacket , and made her slow exit
[301/1000]	he stared at the spot on my shoulder where the bullet got through the flesh and bone . he took a breath through his mouth and let it out slowly , and i wanted to rip my ear out .
[302/1000]	" do n't , " he says . " good . " i do n't reach for my coat , which i guess is the best answer . i do n't dare . " do n't . "
[303/1000]	i stare at him in confusion . " what ? uh , it 's a movie . not like you need a date to come into the room with me and tell me to f * * k off .
[304/1000]	" i 'm not sure , " i say slowly . after a few more minutes of silence , she asks , " do you want any dessert ? " " no , thank you . "
[305/1000]	he looked as if he could hear her on the outside . " i meant what i said about not wanting a kid . i do n't understand why you keep dragging them into this . " " they
[306/1000]	" thank you , " she whispered . i was n't sure whether she had thanked me for giving her a friend or told me by the force of her words that i had not completely destroyed it .
[307/1000]	" what is this place ? " " i have no idea . i just do n't know ! i think it 's a resort , or something like it . i do n't know . there 's nowhere
[308/1000]	" no , i 'm sure you 're not , " he says , stepping closer . " you need to get out of here . let me take you somewhere safe to make sure she 's not going to
[309/1000]	my gaze dropped to the ring on my finger . " do you like ? " i asked , my voice deceptively light , but inside i was frantic . he sat up and propped his feet up on
[310/1000]	instead , he said , " are you prepared ? " " i 'm good . i 'm always ready . " " that 's good . because i have some questions i wanted to ask you about
[311/1000]	" can i help with that ? " " no . " she looked at kate , who seemed to want to protest but knew to go along with it . kate said , " yes . where are
[312/1000]	for the next three hours , and it would last a great deal longer , mary held her breath with anticipation . by the time the bell finally sounded to announce the end of french class , she was feeling
[313/1000]	he did n't answer . not for many minutes after that . a few moments later , he looked up at her and his face softened . " we are going to get through this . my family
[314/1000]	" i 'm here , " said an american . " i guess you need help , " said scofield . " we 're heading to a hotel in a small city called ar men ia . the
[315/1000]	" he means to kill us , " said caleb . " i 'll help if i can . " that did n't answer any of her questions . " why are you doing this ? " "
[316/1000]	" this might be a lot harder than i thought , " i told jack . " you know i got off easy once . " still holding me , jack started to lead me out . "
[317/1000]	" do n't worry , mr. smith . if that 's what i think it is , i can make you a proper bargain . " smith winced at the man 's words but his hand at the gun
[318/1000]	" the same thing . " " but <EOS> , " georgie remembered and now she remembered the way neal . then a little bit later , she tried to see if it were like ... but it
[319/1000]	" um . " zane was too busy eyeing the pool table in his peripheral vision . " actually , when zane was eight or so , he might have run his hand down my arm . " ty
[320/1000]	he shook his head . " there 's not going to be a way to come back from it , with the way things are . it 's in your own hands . at least we have each other but
[321/1000]	i do n't know if her words should have stung me or if people would have been able to believe her , but i 'll be damned if i give her what i 'm sure will be a real engagement
[322/1000]	" you believe it 's just that ? " i had no time to ask , because she was at my side in an instant and was off , spinning around me so she was pressing up against my legs
[323/1000]	i do n't need you to tell me what you are . i can smell you . i smile , feeling even better . he looks away and i do n't know if he does it just to
[324/1000]	" this is important , " i said . " please . i 'm really scared . " he reached into his pocket and gave me the key . i took it out of the ring and opened the
[325/1000]	i took my time and stood next to her . but she was n't finished yet . she looked up at mr. ka van agh . " the woman who came to get me tonight , her name
[326/1000]	" no . " " and what , in your opinion , should i do , exactly ? " " you tell some people to back off . " she shrugged . " and what i know
[327/1000]	" i believe i 've always seen your mother as an excellent mistress , " william pointed out , watching the fire in earnest in the fireplace . " she has n't been to paris or any other of those
[328/1000]	she looked up , waiting . my attention was drawn again to the big picture window that hung on the opposite wall in the corner , and i saw tiny blinds and gray wallpaper , from what i could figure
[329/1000]	" sure . as long as you 're willing to give me your word . " a smile crinkled the corners of her eyes . " do you really need to ask ? " he grinned . "
[330/1000]	with a laugh she slapped at the wall with her fist . " you 're just too hot and bothered to ever let it go . " " hey , in case you n't know , you 're a

[334/1000]	" let me guess . no ? " olivia asked . mrs. keller shook her head . it was impossible . all olivia knew was that this woman was not a normal human . " so what 's going on
[335/1000]	" i can not leave my house without family around . you must tell me , what did you do ? why are you standing outside my house , when i call the police ? " tom 's eyes burned
[336/1000]	" you 'd better go . he 's probably wondering where you and i are now . " " i 'll be right back . " she got dressed and returned to the kitchen table , sitting at
[337/1000]	" please stop talking about her , " i begged . he pressed <EOS> ... tongue . " i can sleep in the same bag as your mother . " my feet slipped off the floor .
[338/1000]	it was a good start to my day . i was getting ready to leave this afternoon when i felt someone step on my sandals . i looked down to see a man standing there , wearing a dark
[339/1000]	" she is not in her rooms ! " " in that case i shall go in search of her . " lucien walked into the hallway and checked the master bedroom 's window . nothing . "
[340/1000]	i shook my head and reached for her , pulling her face down to mine . her lips held mine as best they could to stop my tears . as my breath was taken from me , and it was
[341/1000]	" she 's a vampire , " said jace , as if it had n't occurred to him . " she 's not a vampire . she 's a werewolf . " the words rang with the finality
[342/1000]	" did you really know what happened a week ago ? " chris asked . the professor nodded . " do you think about her often ? do you think what happened would cause her harm , or
[343/1000]	it came and went , but the day did n't last long . the sky was clear . the sun set and the temperature dropped into a comfortable twelve degrees . as soon as they had gone a few feet
[344/1000]	he reached for her , suddenly desperate to touch . he had felt what she 'd felt at first . she 'd been like a warm breeze in his hands . he wanted her too badly . not just
[345/1000]	he reached out , touched the side of my cheek . i gasped after his touch and opened my mouth to beg him for more . to take me like this , to possess me as he wanted . "
[346/1000]	" what 's up , stranger ? " " nothing . " i tell him about how i did n't want to have any details of my conversation with derek and why i 'm feeling so insecure .
[347/1000]	" and i suppose he 's doing what he thinks he has to ? " " i 've never heard the like . he was , at least , from the time he was born . his father was
[348/1000]	" get everyone out ! " " no , dad , you need to move the ... " the young man 's voice trailed off , as the woman 's large frame loomed over him in rage . the
[349/1000]	some time after five o'clock , jack was sitting on the passenger 's side of his car with a coffee in his hand . he had been drinking a cup of instant , or possibly a large cup of steaming
[350/1000]	something in my spine stiffens as i look around the dimly lit room . there are no chairs , only an odd array of metal benches , a few desks , but the only other objects in the room are
[351/1000]	" yes . " he went rigid and his face went completely still . she did n't need his reassurance that he was still hard . she rubbed her belly against him again . " and i agree with
[352/1000]	he ran his hands along his hips slightly , then back to the buttons of his shirt , quickly undoing each one . his jeans slid lower on his hips . it looked like he was going to go commando
[353/1000]	2 - the death 2 - they 're 2 - the road 2 - they 're 2 - they are 2 - they 're 2 - they 're 2 - they 're
[354/1000]	" ah , boy , what is it , a little mystery ? you and i have a few things to solve before we leave and i 'm not looking forward to them . your mother and i would like
[355/1000]	we climbed in the van and zipped over to his condo . " so tell me about mom and her family . " " we 'll probably never talk about it . " he walked inside , and
[356/1000]	" i have the one on my nightstand , " he whispers . " but you 'd better go get that first . " i nod , not trusting my knees to stay up . he turns away and
[357/1000]	i did n't give his offer any thought at all . it sounded reasonable . " i do n't know how long it 'll be until my car , but i 'll just go to the bank and try
[358/1000]	" fine ! fine ! " she shouted , holding the towel to her chest . then she wiped her face and grabbed a clean shirt and put her shorts on and raced out of the bathroom . *
[359/1000]	but as i had hoped , nothing had happened to him . my heart sank . at last i spotted the figure walking toward the beach and i rushed to meet him . " mr. thorne ! "
[360/1000]	" well , good luck but i think mr. henderson is getting into more trouble because i am going to have to leave . i have some of those paper . and i do n't know when i will be
[361/1000]	i opened my eyes this time . the dark was more pronounced back here , but the moonlight was off to the left of me , and there was n't a lot to focus on . i could see the
[362/1000]	he just kept to himself . at first . he just seemed so ... quiet . i thought about calling him up . said i needed to talk to him . then when he finally stepped out of the room
[363/1000]	" how long have you known ? " " i 've known from the moment i was birthed to my true calling . " " and how long ago was that ? " " since i was
[364/1000]	her cheeks turned bright red . " yes , sir . " she 'd done just that , too , and she did n't know what he asked her . their gazes held . the storm crashed over them
[365/1000]	" i found them just like this in my room . " to my dismay , i realized with alarm that i sounded like a child . " mom , you 're going to get us busted for looking
[366/1000]	" let 's get those tools , " i said . " you sure ? " " yeah , i 'm sure . " i took a deep breath and felt for the first time that my whole
[367/1000]	" let 's go . " " not tonight , " she said . she caught hold of his hand again and they walked back toward the car . the sun was setting now and a night of
[368/1000]	" and who is ' that ? " " the devil . " a wave of laughter rippled around them . " what ? " " you heard me . " " nothing . "
[369/1000]	" not so fast , " he said , turning to glare at me . " what a nice surprise . i suppose i knew you were n't going to make it all alone . " " get your
[370/1000]	" wow . " i said . i held out my arm and they took it . one of them then took a shot from our little vial , but i had no sense of the difference . i was
[371/1000]	his teeth and tongue are sharp . his eyes are warm and inviting . he 's an animal in bed . at least , that 's what he says . " what is an animal in bed ? "
[372/1000]	" go ahead , " the demon encouraged . " do all they say . i promise to listen . " " i do n't know , " ivy said as she put the papers back in the desk
[373/1000]	he watched her with hooded eyes , his hands tight around her wrists . he did n't look away as he whispered , " let 's try again . " her hand , hand still grasping his , clutched
[374/1000]	the prince turned to look at the woman who sat across the aisle . " you 're an incredible woman . " the woman smiled . " i 'm flattered . " " why are you here ?
[375/1000]	i nodded , accepting that he was right . " so tell me about yourself . " i asked him about himself . it was a direct question . he tilted his head and considered my question for a
[376/1000]	" you guys might as well make up some fantasy , " max said and slid into the seat beside me . i rolled my eyes at max as an added incentive to do the right thing .
[377/1000]	' or in relation to each other , or with anybody , ' she said , after waiting thoughtfully for some time . ' in other words , it may well be a very old and very complex matter .
[378/1000]	" no , you 're not . that girl is mine . " " oh , you 're mine , " he said and he kissed me , and i felt my world go dark , and i felt
[379/1000]	" yes , " he said . he would make her stay . and soon . " go back to sleep . " " mmm , " she said in a deep , throaty murmur . " i like
[380/1000]	i nodded again , my voice trembling . " i will . " he watched me for a moment , as if waiting for something . i shook my head slowly and hoped it would n't make me faint .
[381/1000]	and that made her feel even worse . she had n't even noticed that the snow was coming down harder . she stumbled as she made the snow fall . this was the middle of the night for
[382/1000]	" does it matter ? " he snorted . " you 'll never - no matter what you do , she wo n't ever find me . the only mistake i made was having said her name . "
[383/1000]	" then why is he still here , your majesty ? " oh , no . " he left her . " the white king 's cold voice had never sounded more deadly . queen lati ssia
[384/1000]	" no , <EOS> " came ben 's voice . " i 'm sorry , " i blurted , not wanting any apologies . " you said i wanted you to take care of your sister . "
[385/1000]	" no . what ? " mary nodded . she stood down in front of mary and did a few stretches with her . " go out , do your normal chores but do n't walk this time . i
[386/1000]	" fine let 's talk about it then . " " ok , will you please tell me what 's going on . " " ah , ok , ok ! " said jonathan . " you have
[387/1000]	" oh ! it 's about the other job , " she said , holding up two fingers . " we hired someone to take a look at it right away and it still leaves a trail . "
[388/1000]	i watched him carefully as he sat up in bed , and i knew he was thinking about the baby . with the way he was looking at me , i could tell he was n't sure how to handle
[389/1000]	" no <EOS> so - " i do n't tell him her name does n't come . then his laugh . " you 're too good if you care about a person . it 's not in you .
[390/1000]	" i do n't know what happened but the only person in my family who wants to do me harm is my parents and my grandparents . i want to help you and the rest of your family escape this
[391/1000]	but he knew . he could hear the alarm in her voice . he could hear her fear . god , he wanted to just scoop her into his arms and run the rest of the way to his bed
[392/1000]	a sound escapes my lips . " what is it ? " logan looks up at me , and i shake my head . " i want to have sex with you . " i step back ,
[393/1000]	" why would she want to have him with them ? he 's her friend , so she has to know we 'd all disapprove , right ? " olivia nodded . the woman had a point .

[397/1000]	they walked into the room overlooking the gardens . the room had a great room with a full bar as well as a pool table in the corner . the people they passed were all male . he went
[398/1000]	" you really think so ? " anna nodded . " you told me about the people on the planet who live on the surface . are they all like a bunch of ants ? " anna seemed
[399/1000]	" fine , i 'll go shopping with you . " " as soon as we finish . " he grinned back . " i 'll get the food ready . " " that 's my girl
[400/1000]	" i agree with her , " said wil x . " she has been too hard on us over the years to come back up with a better version of what life is all about . " dr.
[401/1000]	i watched chase like ... a child . he was still looking at me in a weird way and the look between us let me know he was confused . " i 'm afraid you have to do that
[402/1000]	his lips curled in a hint of embarrassment . " it 's like i found that for all the pleasure in the world , " he said then grinned across the space between us . " i hope you find
[403/1000]	if anything , that made it worse . he 'd be just like - " you 're going to stay with a male wolf , " the voice finished . her head whipped around . the woman in

[405/1000]	" have you seen what happened at last call ? the local police did n't seem to be enough to scare him off . i have n't heard of any explosions . " " i heard they 're trying
[406/1000]	" it 'll be okay , " zane murmured , and his fingers smoothed down ty 's face . ty sighed deeply and nuzzled at zane as he turned his head away , his eyes closing in exhaustion .
[407/1000]	" i should hope not . that 's no way to look at your first kiss . " " sorry , " i laugh . " i 'm just kidding . " " good . now to how
[408/1000]	" if it makes you happy . " " i always had three years - " " if you give me that time of my life - " " you , " i take a step toward

[410/1000]	i 'd never realized how much i would miss my life there . " was she all right in there ? " " i hate that i 'm not more attentive , that i miss more than i 'll

[413/1000]	" will you marry me ? " i ask . it suddenly seems so much easier . i feel lighter and carefree . with a quiet laugh , my dad squeezes my hands . " no , my dear
[414/1000]	" no , no , " she said , waving him off . " come on . i 'll walk with you to school . " * * * * * * * * * * * * *
[415/1000]	she smiled . " yes . " " and what does your cousin do ? you do n't mind sharing any secrets , do you ? " " um , well sure . it 's not me .
[416/1000]	" no , i just want to know . <EOS> , i want to know . " " he 's at the wheel , so i want to know . when you and max leave , how are you
[417/1000]	" i know , but he has to . i ca n't live in the house looking like a lovesick fool all the time . " " you know , " she said wistfully , watching the traffic whiz

[419/1000]	she heard him reach for the television remote , flipped it on and put her hands behind her head . she rolled toward him and leaned forward . " so i 've said , " she said , " but
[420/1000]	" how can you think that ? " " i could n't have my father leave me , " he said , so quietly it was almost a whisper . " not for good reason . nor could i
[421/1000]	" no ! " " no there are no other options in their land , " said captain grey to henry . " sir ! " gasped henry , shocked . grey raised up from his chair
[422/1000]	he found the courage his legs were n't enough support for him to get to the bed . the woman was lying on her side . her hair was tied loosely at the nape of her neck , and
[423/1000]	this was not good , especially if he had to keep pulling this out of me . he got down on his knees in front of me and put both hands to my belly , leaning forward to touch
[424/1000]	" what are you doing here ? " we stop our progress on the porch of our house and turn to see her standing outside of the porch , arms crossed . " what are you doing ? " i
[425/1000]	" okay , so you 're both here but where is your car ? " paul asked . both of them turned . paul looked back at the pickup and saw that he was there . the back door
[426/1000]	" yes . no longer can you make me stand in front of public with no words to describe it . but be gentle with me . " his fingers found her clit , and she bucked against him
[427/1000]	" yes , " he says , not bothering to look down . " i do n't understand . " a slow , patient smile appears . " well , i will when the time comes . "
[428/1000]	as soon as she recognized sam 's face , she broke into laughter . " there must be some great people in this world who have the same taste in music , " she said , then looked up
[429/1000]	" sorry , " jim said . " yeah , i can see that . maybe you should have thought of that sooner . " now jack shifted his weight . " that 's only the beginning of
[430/1000]	" no problem , no problem , " he said again . he could tell i was n't going to budge an inch . my hand strayed back to the bottle of whiskey that i kept squir re led

[436/1000]	her gaze landed on the bottle to his right and her mouth dropped open . the bottle was almost half full , and the rim had a small liquid in it . a small silver container . " that's ...

[440/1000]	i turned , shaking my fist at logan . " what ? what do you want ? you want someone to get pissed off that you 're doing this to me ? " anger clouded logan 's face .
[441/1000]	you would think he 'd have felt protective of her . " the situation with amy would ruin everything , " emily says to both of us . her voice breaks , and her shoulders shake with silent sobs
[442/1000]	" i would like to help , " he replies , " i can not , not without this power of the earth and a new body and a new ... soul . " " there is not much

[452/1000]	her gaze drifted over the deep red walls , which were adorned with portraits of men and women of all ages . over the years only a few had hung in this castle . these were the faces of the
[453/1000]	" why you ? surely there are fewer people and less chances to find a replacement and destroy the power before it has been used , " asked sophia . " apparently i was not the only one who
[454/1000]	" as my godmother he - " agnes stopped , unable to continue . " as your godmother , you might be taking her place . " she gasped . she was taking her position of power .
[455/1000]	" do you really think that 'll help anyone ? " she said . " they do n't seem interested in talking to each other . " she knew he meant the way they came at it <EOS> so
[456/1000]	" maybe , " he said . " or else they 'd have come here sooner . " " why would they have ? " " a lot of reasons , " he said . " the cops
[457/1000]	" is my car nearby ? " " um . " then she looked at him with amusement . " why do you ask ? " " my house is across the street from your dad 's .
[458/1000]	so i 'd finally found myself holding a little magic . i 'd finally begun using it . i 'd created a power that bound me . a power that could bind a man to a woman in power .
[459/1000]	the men began to laugh . " i know it 's possible and we 'll find a way for you to come , " said captain gri sw old . " we will even return with your brother and brother
[460/1000]	the sound of the hammer coming off a hammer was like shooting out an un er ring cartridge . " that 's a smith , though , right ? " i heard the smooth , familiar click - click
[461/1000]	" he 'd brought his little dog along in his car , " said the captain . " looks like he 's got his hands full with that one . i do n't see her , though . where are
[462/1000]	" why did you marry me , " she said as she moved to pick up the mail she 'd dropped on the floor . " first , because you asked me so nicely , and i want something
[463/1000]	" not sure i understand what you mean , " he replies . there 's not much that he does n't know about the mysterious mr. frost , what makes him tick . but he has no clue that more
[464/1000]	" so do you , actually . " i looked him square in the eyes . " i do n't think you understand your place in my life . but you 're a good friend to my childhood . i
[465/1000]	" yes , " he murmured into her fingers . " and you 're going to go after the book , are n't you ? " " yes . " " you are ? " "
[466/1000]	the same thing she was doing every day . a few moments ago , i 'd been feeling too warm and fuzzy to realize how much i missed her , and now i could n't even remember if i 'd
[467/1000]	instead , she followed the sound down into the small cellar , which led about four stories past the top floor . that must have been where the generator had been . it was much smaller than it seemed on
[468/1000]	" yes . he was supposed to , but he did n't manage to do anything . he was at the top of the list for an asylum . " and when they came to the end , i
[469/1000]	" we know already , " steve said . " there was an announcement yesterday of a new virus . it 's all over the global population . " " we 'll have to contact other people in the
[470/1000]	" tell me . " " i 've ... um ... been working a lot lately . " he frowned at me , and i took a step back . " working ? " " i ...
[471/1000]	" no . " she looks at me , her mouth is set in a determined line . " stop trying to drive me mad . it 's going to end . " i lower my hands from the
[472/1000]	" you have to tell me what 's going on , " i said . she reached into her pocket and pulled out a cigarette , but she held it up to my face . it was her cigarette
[473/1000]	" i 'll come right back . " even though i did n't know if i was supposed to , i managed to push out , " see you around . we 'll talk again very soon . "
[474/1000]	" but i need you ! " he pleaded with me . " i think i 'm dying . can you help me ! " " i 'm sorry , " i replied . " i really really am
[475/1000]	in his own part , he wanted his revenge . a sick pleasure tore at him . why did it have to be her ? the silence stretched long before someone spoke again . that voice made him think
[476/1000]	there was only one way to find out . and i was going to take that chance . * * * the two soldiers were waiting for me at the parking lot . they kept their weapons close
[477/1000]	" that 's great , honey . i love getting to know my children , so i did n't have any other plans for first saturday afternoon . as soon as i 'm ready to leave , we 're calling
[478/1000]	" you think they would eat us ? " he shrugged . " not really . " he 'd left two bags of blood in his trunk . everything else in his room . " it 's a small

[480/1000]	the woman could have been older than i or older than me , but i thought she certainly could have been closer to twenty - one . i could n't see her age in the face , but at least
[481/1000]	a faint , soft noise came out of the corner of his mouth . " i should have known , " he said , his tone low . " aye , my parents believed it too . " his
[482/1000]	" i told her we should wait , that everything was fine , " he says and pauses , " but you know what she said ? well ? " he asks . " let her decide for herself .
[483/1000]	it had been a long time , but after what they had shared he felt he had finally come to see it for what it really was . his wife . " my love , " he whispered
[484/1000]	my eyes darted to him and my brows drew together . " um ... yes . " his brows drew together . then he asked , " why are you askin ' me that , honey ? "
[485/1000]	" hello , daddy , " she crooned from her perch on the side of the bed . " what 's the point of being without me if i ca n't even talk to you ? " they 'd
[486/1000]	" are you sure ? " i asked , suddenly worried . " you say you 'll be traveling with sam , but when you get back , you 'll be staying with his mother . he wo n't be
[487/1000]	they had an appointment for some dinner but that was more than enough to know their lunch was off to a fine start with him sharing his own personal life . maybe , from what he noted in his interview
[488/1000]	* * * " i hate it here . " anna moaned . anna was an annoying girl who enjoyed being around old people on television . anna was a big fan of her , and if she
[489/1000]	" a ... ? " she gave him a perplexed look . " and your name is n't ... " " yes , that 's what people call me now . i 'm alex . " " i
[490/1000]	an arrow hit him straight in the chest . he stumbled away from her the instant he 'd seen the arrow fall from her arm . he did n't recognize the shooter . hell . she could
[491/1000]	who was this girl ? why was she standing right over my face like that ? in the corner of my eye , i saw a figure walk quickly over . who was this girl ? did she
[492/1000]	" i 've tried to talk to you about her , about what she means to me , but you have n't replied . " i said , pointing to the two women . " have you seen them ,
[493/1000]	" i do n't know . it 's weird not knowing . is n't that weird ? it 's not even like you ever find out who you belong to . " " do n't be ridiculous , of
[494/1000]	the man nodded . " what could he possibly have told you - or anyone else - that would've made you think the truth had to stay that way , because that would be the truth . "
[495/1000]	she held up her hands like soldiers were in armor . " we 've caught up with the rest of them . they can all go home . everything will be better in the morning . " " do
[496/1000]	" oh , mr. and mrs. buckley , now you have our attention . please , let 's not go overboard . " " my children want to come over to the house , too , " he added
[497/1000]	" let 's see , " agreed the president of the united states . " the north american flag . the red one . our flag , with the blue for the president . my flag , our flag ;
[498/1000]	on the day before re be k kah 's funeral , my mother gave me a letter from professor sil ford . today she said that she will miss her favorite man , professor sil ford , who now
[499/1000]	" well , maybe in theory , but think of it this way : we may not have known how to work her body properly , how to properly bind her to the device like you have . what you
[500/1000]	one of the others is carrying a red rose , a bottle of gin , and a full glass , which she takes to the booth . she takes a step backward , and a man with hair almost as
[501/1000]	" i know it will . " another hand clapped him on the shoulder . " but you are n't going to fall apart on me , either . so quit being a pessi mist and be a brave man
[502/1000]	he laughed , but it was a high , nervous laugh and he swallowed it . " your father said ... he said that if he made the son of a bitch who was trying to keep him safe ,
[503/1000]	i 'm back in the car and <EOS> ... i 'm still here . " he 's alive . " the words out of my mouth surprise us both , but i 'm certain it 's true .
[504/1000]	" i 'm in love with you , " he finally whispered . my chest swelled with emotion . " oh god you 're so beautiful . " i ran my hands over his hair and he leaned up
[505/1000]	that was not the kind of man she was , but she was n't going to stop . that made her a predator . that was the way she used to be . that was the way her father used
[506/1000]	" you mean people will die . " " we know . we 're here to help . " my own eyes widened , and i sat upright , pulling away , and trying to look casual .
[507/1000]	" oh my god . i thought he killed him . " " well , the thing is , we are all afraid of our own husbands and lovers . most couples are . and those who choose to
[508/1000]	" how long until mom gets herself together again ? " kira asked , hoping to calm both of them . kira glanced at the house , where she 'd stayed just before turning in to sleep for the
[509/1000]	he had one . he pulled out a folded piece of paper and held it to his chest . then he raised his arm and pointed it at me , as if a switch had been flipped in the back
[510/1000]	" very well , then . how ? " " with me i 'll show you . you 'll be happy , i can promise you that , " he said , standing up and coming to lean on
[511/1000]	" we do n't mean to interrupt , " she began again . " we 've all missed you . " chris felt uncomfortable around them . " chris , what have you done , " he breathed .
[512/1000]	' did my mother ever come to visit you ? ' ' i think my mother came over that way once . ' ' oh , ' laura said . ' that 's awful . that 's always
[513/1000]	i nodded , surprised . " yes . " his right eyelid twitched . a look of regret passed through his eyes as his smile faded . " fuck . i 'm sorry . i did n't mean -
[514/1000]	when he arrived , all of the men were waiting , all of them at least as tall as he was , and tall enough to be handsome . " i 'll introduce you to my friend , my
[515/1000]	" yeah . " i gave him a narrow look because he 'd lost his cool . i wanted to believe him . now i did n't . " good , " he muttered but his voice was
[516/1000]	he opened his mouth to speak but all i felt was his hand at my neck sliding up my back ( he had his other arm wrapped tight around my waist , i had to press my face into his
[517/1000]	" i know what he has gone through , and i hope to never see you again . but i promise you , that i will never forgive you . i promise , i will always never get close to
[518/1000]	though in some ways , i felt a little responsible for being the cause of that . it had been a long time since i had been in a relationship . a long time since i had been married ,
[519/1000]	i do n't want to get sucked into the present when he tells me he 's not going away for spring break . " you can stay here with me as long as you want . " micha drops
[520/1000]	" maybe you could say it , " the girl said . " the man and woman get a meal at his place around eight tomorrow night , and that way the two of them can sleep in separate
[521/1000]	" no i do n't need her for that . as much as i 'd like to be , i 'm not in the mood for any nice things . " <EOS> , maybe maybe the time i grew up
[522/1000]	' please . promise me . ' ' and what do i do to get you to listen to me ? ' he snarled . ' just promise me that you 'll come to no harm in the interim
[523/1000]	i started to say something but was stopped by a loud voice and someone grabbed me by the neck . " i have an idea ! " i looked in front of me and saw an angry looking
[524/1000]	" i never saw any vampire kill anyone , " gregor said , laughing . " yeah , just me , though , " bones replied . " the only reason they had n't was because no one knew
[525/1000]	you 're a natural in a crisis , miss .... with the question at the bottom of her mind , rachel thought it was time to move on to other matters . ' what else are you up to
[526/1000]	she took another swig from her bottle and said , " i 'm worried about his health . do you think he 'll want to go to the hospital to get it ? " i nodded , but i
[527/1000]	his lips curved to his jaw . " so you - " " i like you , " he said softly . the smile faded . her gaze lowered to his mouth . " you 're lying
[528/1000]	" yes , " she agreed . " but it should n't be hard if they 're after you , " she added , turning back to the others . " i was just surprised ... with all them stories
[529/1000]	she would be lying if she said she did n't regret returning home after the incident . not that he gave a damn about the incident . he was merely doing his job . that was it . but he
[530/1000]	i pulled my head from his , and he turned his to follow mine through the door . he walked with me several steps , and i could feel the heat of his body warming my back . from
[531/1000]	" he 's going to take just about anything you 've got , and if not for us , he would have taken it when he had a chance . it 's a shame you were n't a bastard when
[532/1000]	we all looked at each other , unsure how this was going to go . i think every single single person was just trying to make sure that things did n't go wrong . colt had taken over ,
[533/1000]	" not at all . " the two of them spent the next thirty minutes talking about the weather and the sights and the variety of foods in town . hannah remembered to introduce him to tom , not that
[534/1000]	" good . i 'm here to help . " her eyes sparkled . " i wish a whole other world could be like this . " sam snorted . " everything we do , " she went
[535/1000]	" we take to the skies just as you do , milady . " " for tonight , you do your job . you all do your work and i will do mine . " * liam
[536/1000]	* * * i stayed outside the house , on the porch . it was a very old - fashioned part of the house . my dad had already left the dining room , and he was putting the
[537/1000]	" yeah , " i said , and we both took long drags on our cigarettes . we sat in silence for what felt like a very long time and finally david broke the silence . " hey ,
[538/1000]	" all right , sir . the first thing i want to do is come back to you to see what you 've got right now . for the love of god , put a muzzle on it ! "
[539/1000]	" i ... erm ... i 'm not sure , sir . it 's <EOS> " mr . fletcher " - not really my first name . although since i used to be called william when i was first promoted
[540/1000]	" yes . just a few minutes ago i thought i saw a white shadow move across the street , but then i saw a man come out of the shadows and disappear . then we ran to the nearest
[541/1000]	he turned to her , his face serious . " but i ca n't take a chance on getting you harmed at work . i ca n't pretend that 's going to happen at all . the risk is too
[542/1000]	" so , mr. k rue ger , " holly begins , " you brought helen back here to bring her home . how did she like it ? " " she loved it . like it mattered .
[543/1000]	" we 're just fine . nothing wrong with ... " " did i say anything that would make you think it was ? i swear , i 'm not trying to be rude , but what 's going
[544/1000]	" i am not a fighter . i did not have to fight , and i did not have to see the blood of the men i harmed just to survive . " " in a way you did
[545/1000]	i know what you 're suffering . the thought is almost comical . a quick glance at my watch confirms that i have fifteen minutes before the big event begins . * * * i 'm already
[546/1000]	i was n't supposed to be touched . but damn , i wanted it to be skin to skin . i wanted it to be real . i was n't supposed to want his fingers sliding in my
[547/1000]	" well , what can i say , i was in the right place at the right time . " he smiled , a very rare expression that did n't reach his eyes . " at the right
[548/1000]	he nodded . " i 'm here with our mutual friend . what 's your name ? " " sara , " she said , extending her hand and smiling . " pleased to meet you sara .
[549/1000]	" where ? " " where does this mean ? where does that tell you that it is a lie ? " " is there anything in this picture that we can do to find the truth ,
[550/1000]	" you do n't realize they 're the worst killers , " she said , " you have n't been around them like i have . " " no , " he said , " i do n't ,
[551/1000]	a sharp rap sounded at the door , and all eyes went in that direction , including his . as if on cue , a tall , very thin woman entered the room and shut the door behind her
[552/1000]	" sure is . " " what about you ? " " not much going on in general , other than i 'm a big fan of american spy fiction . " " you sound surprised .
[553/1000]	" i love you so much , " he vowed , and i was sure he meant it . " you 're already my wife , " he vowed with a grin . " i was too slow this
[554/1000]	my gaze locked onto her and she took a step toward the open window . it was still wide open . i glanced at the nightstand . shit . damn it . a horrible feeling squeezed
[555/1000]	" hello . are anyone here , " she called out . " yes , mrs. mitchell . " " i 'm hoping you 're in the house , " aria gushed . " i ran into your
[556/1000]	" i 'll go and see her . they have children here . i 'll find out what all of this is about and i 'll get the results immediately . " " very well . well , i
[557/1000]	the man stood up , and walked to the desk where i was sitting . he lifted a manila file folder off the paper , and took out an official looking document . he sat on the edge , and
[558/1000]	" only a dream , " she murmured . " you 're making a mistake , " ben said softly . " am i ? " " uh , yeah . your idea of a good time
[559/1000]	she cleared her throat . a dry lump lodged in her throat . " it was a long time ago . " " but you do recall hearing from my head ... " ... " ... your mind ...
[560/1000]	" with him , " she confirms absently , staring down into her eyes , " it 's just something he 's done for me . i got used to it . it gave me something to look forward to
[561/1000]	" they know that , <EOS> but they thought an attempt would be enough . " " it wo n't work for them . " it 's not worth it anyway . a small woman as she
[562/1000]	where had that come from ? when had she done that ? since she 'd arrived two hours ago , she looked like she was about to burst into tears . before she could stop herself , she wiped her
[563/1000]	our teacher was a nice , warm man , and he always smiled at me and said that he was proud of me when i was young and always encouraging me to open my future and keep my grades up
[564/1000]	" sorry . got caught up in the moment . " i held my hand up to ward her off . " it was a great sight . " she grinned . " i just meant that it
[565/1000]	if only there was something to stop him from harming the girls ; maybe if they heard of his real intention one of them would start telling the truth about what he had done . that would n't be so
[566/1000]	" so ... how are you two doing ? " i ask as she sits up beside me . i give her a half - hearted smile and then my mind snaps back to the present . " yeah
[567/1000]	" well i still like to work so , i guess . she has four kids . she always calls me at night , or comes over , depending on where she 's been . " " five ?
[568/1000]	" you look beautiful , " gabriel said softly , with a loving touch . the endearment sent a shiver through her . then she frowned as she realized he had n't called or even asked her name .
[569/1000]	but it looked like there was a lot more to the story than that . i watched , intrigued , as cole reached into his back pocket . he had a black , leather wallet in his hand .
[570/1000]	" no . not at all . " he was almost out the door and then turned back with a smile . " i had thought about getting a little more ... " i cut him off , giving
[571/1000]	" yes , " she said as she smiled up at him . " but there 's no such thing as a certain angel , so just call me angel . " " all right , okay , i
[572/1000]	" thank you , " i replied . " now , tell me again about your dream , " he urged intently . " it 's about a young woman i love . she 's getting married soon
[573/1000]	once she 'd regained control of herself , she repeated , " i 'm so sorry , jake . i tried contacting him and i just can not do that . i know that you can . i 'll just
[574/1000]	" all right , okay . but someone has got to speak up so we do n't miss off the road . " i took all three of us outside and together we had a last - minute survey
[575/1000]	" ah ! " the stranger smiled as he pulled a black , leather jacket from his briefcase . " i love you , too . " " good . i hope they find that gun real , and
[576/1000]	" of course , " she said , her eyes shining , the glow at her cheekbones lighting her up . " are you going to tell me what 's up ? " he asked , hoping like hell
[577/1000]	now to your other issue , to what you were going to say before you were called out . can i ask you a question ? " " yes . " " okay , well , when you
[578/1000]	" i think i need to get over there , " she said grimly . " for a few days , " he agreed . " well , there 's something else . " dante narrowed his
[579/1000]	she nodded , her expression soft and trusting . that same sweet , timid expression . " i do want him back , but you need to let him go . let him go , and things will work out
[580/1000]	to save time , i went into the dressing room and let my hair down . i could see my reflection in the mirror -- but i was n't sure exactly what i was looking at . instead ,
[581/1000]	" your brother would n't mess with you like this . " " and you would n't want him to do what i said , either . " " fair enough . " she rested her chin on
[582/1000]	" i can not tell you how relieved i was that they said yes . " she leaned against the doorframe , which took a little too long . " thank god , " i said , feeling like
[583/1000]	" i do n't know what you 've heard , " i said . " is he dead ? " i shrugged . he did n't look happy . this situation felt just as dangerous as the last
[584/1000]	" do n't leave your house , " she replied . " go on and do something nice like change into yoga pants because your house looks like a freakin ' ghetto ghetto . " " you have got
[585/1000]	" oh my god , i think he 's gay . " " huh ? " i said in disbelief . " what am i supposed to do ? " " i do n't know . wait for
[586/1000]	" and you 've asked who i am . who i am . no you did the wrong thing . i thought that is what we <EOS> now have to say to one another . " " no ,
[587/1000]	he stood up . " how does it feel to be your boss ? " he asked . " i know this might sound strange , because i have a very old and powerful vampire that i keep under
[588/1000]	" you will not be allowed to help me . " " why not ? " she stared up at her brother . " because he 'll kill you . " " how much did you hear
[589/1000]	" here , " i say , handing him my purse . my knees are shaking , and i want to throw my arms around him and do my best to cry . my hand meets his when he holds
[590/1000]	" would you like to go for a cup before i show you what i intend to do ? " " i would love to . " " i would expect you to attend the graduation ceremonies first
[591/1000]	" i do n't like this , grace , " he said . " it 's not right . " his wife had gone . grace could feel it . the two - room house was quiet as
[592/1000]	there 's only one man he could be talking to . he 's got to be a local , but i never saw him before in my life . " she used to be one of the prettiest girls
[593/1000]	he nodded , almost as if he understood she was n't sure of anything in her life right now . " we could try something . " after all , she 'd been trying to reconcile herself to the
[594/1000]	" i am . " then he kissed her lips for a long time . " she wo n't die , will she ? " " when the time comes , she wo n't be dead . "
[595/1000]	he nodded , his forehead resting against hers . " good for you . but if you need to cry , just pretend they 'll take them . i 'll be right over there . " he held out his
[596/1000]	" you could have known this would have happened . " " the information is the information , " he said quietly . " i do n't know how to stop it . have you got any suggestions ,
[597/1000]	" hello . " " that was you was n't it ? " it was her face that took the blow . her body shook violently . " yeah , it was me . i saw your
[598/1000]	" mr. baley <EOS> as in my study of you know if we talk one another , all you do is stare , " " very well , " said fastolfe back , " this is certainly a remarkable
[599/1000]	" he 's with me now . let 's get outta here . " " are you going to get arrested ? " " nah . " rick 's hand reached into his backpack , pulling out the
[600/1000]	she smiled . " no , i can not . " " why not ? " she looked away . " your mother said what had happened to me was a nightmare with him , and i 'll
[601/1000]	" i thought they said that the city itself was free and secure ? " i shook my head . " they 'd lied . " " and do you think it 's possible they 'd want our
[602/1000]	" okay , where exactly is where ... in some other city ? " " no ... " replied the dragon . they went on . " and what day is it ? " said nomi ,
[603/1000]	" i 'm here to pick you up . " " did you call me ? " " no , " he admitted , " it 's the wrong line . " " oh . " she
[604/1000]	" she 'll have to talk to you . " " the problem will always be that she 's my mother . " " there 's something else . " he heard silence . " was
[605/1000]	" okay , " i told him . " it 'll be a fun time , i promise . so ... what 's up ? " she smiled warmly . " hi ! " she hollered over to the
[606/1000]	" i promise to stay put , " ben assures him and i can clearly see the nervousness in his eyes . " will you wait here with me ? " i ask . he nods and i lean
[607/1000]	" why would he do that ? why would he try to kill you ? " " just asking , dear girl . i wanted to know what you had done . " how did she know about
[608/1000]	" it says to call you by your name when you go to visit your dear friend in america , " elizabeth responded . " i knew you 'd have something in mind . " elizabeth could feel her smile
[609/1000]	" i love that man . it 's a good thing i met you or i would have had to keep my dick in my pants . " " you know you 're not supposed to say that to
[610/1000]	" so how about this then ? " dylan said as she stared at him , a small smile on her face . " you do this for me , and i 'll do this for you . we 'll
[611/1000]	" where 're the other guys ? " " they went in the shop last night ... there was a big fight when they got back the next morning ... " " hey ! maybe they 'll see
[612/1000]	" no ... i mean you ca n't live in the future without a future past , right ? do you understand ? then you have to die before you can have those kids . even if you lived your
[613/1000]	" yeah , well ... maybe now you will , " she muttered , rubbing her forehead . " but first we need to settle this . " a wave of jealousy slapped her across the face that he
[614/1000]	" a pretty voice is even better than you . " " that depends . why is the only one who does n't disagree is the one who wants power ? " it was the one who got
[615/1000]	" but i did n't get hurt , " i said . " go on upstairs . " he pointed at the landing and walked toward the stairs without one last shot at my pathetic attempt at escaping .
[616/1000]	" do you ever eat ? " " i will not deny that i eat occasionally , " i say , reaching for a grape , " but it is rare that i can indulge myself . you must
[617/1000]	' are you sure ? ' ' yes dear . ' angelica sighed . ' i know you miss her very much . but you know i could n't just give in if things were the way
[618/1000]	" and who 's gon na do her dirty work ? " <EOS> , the one who 'd hurt her while the demon had ripped her arms wide open until she cried out in pain . " wait .
[619/1000]	" why ? what would i have to do with anything ? " " you said that the people working for the government would turn it their own way . so it 's probably a new rule . maybe
[620/1000]	" how old are you ? " " twelve . " " and you 're sixteen . " " so ? what does that say about me ? " he had no idea she was such small
[621/1000]	" i did it once . that 's my whole year . so if you say it 's a different year , i 'll accept it . but if it 's as great as you say , i still accept
[622/1000]	" you ca n't just open your gift and never answer my questions . " " no , " i answered honestly . " will you at least say something ? " " no , " i
[623/1000]	* * * after a breakfast of eggs and toast and a last few pieces of hash browns , we started back to the motel . i noticed that the blue toyota was nowhere in sight . i tried
[624/1000]	" did you make it ? " i asked , taking in the faint tinge of green on the pavement below us . " did you make it out to the river ? i heard you were on your way
[625/1000]	if he wanted her here then he was going to have to do his damnedest to show her exactly how he felt . chapter twenty - nine charlie worked through the rest of the week sitting in her
[626/1000]	" no you 're not . that 's cheating . " nick laughed as he continued to walk into the room . " are you questioning my judgment about what kind of guy i am ? " "
[627/1000]	i stared at him , unsure how to respond . not sure what to , i just nodded dumbly . * * * " i hear you 've been spending quite an arrangement with the club recently .
[628/1000]	we both went silent . to be honest , i had n't expected him to fall totally on his guard and answer my question anyway . i only knew that i loved him ; if he could n't let himself
[629/1000]	" i 'm scared , too . " i leaned in close to her , trying to soothe her . " you 're scared of me . " " no , i 'm worried about those guys down
[630/1000]	" okay . call the front desk and let them know i want to speak with the sheriff first . " they met halfway from the station to the deputy administration building and sat down . " sheriff
[631/1000]	he did n't . i felt something , a presence , out of the corner of my eye as edward said , " the vampires are looking forward to this weekend . " i turned just in time
[632/1000]	he smiled . " i really like your red hair . and those sexy blue eyes . and your curves . and your body . " he leaned closer . " i think about ... other things a lot .
[633/1000]	he shook his head . " no , my lady - i know you can only marry one man , and not many can take more than one lover . never that person . i do n't know why you
[634/1000]	" and you always carry a gun , " he noted . she nodded . " it 's a self - defense weapon designed to kill any who attempt to hurt me . but before he said ' attack
[635/1000]	" i 'm going to go for a ride , go and grab a bite to eat . you sure you want to stay in ? " he leans over to whisper to me . his lips are on mine
[636/1000]	" well i see people up here all day . why are they dead ? " " i do n't know . they simply are n't part of our world anymore . " i told him . " i
[637/1000]	" i think you would , do n't you ? " i ask her . " you know , because of your family 's history . " brooke lets out a weak smile and shrugs . brooke 's
[638/1000]	" you know what i mean . it does n't matter , the point 's done . sorry , though . get on with it . " one second she smiled , the next she went deathly pale .
[639/1000]	he laughed softly . " it was n't all that hard . " " oh ? " cole smiled . " the sex was amazing , but not as wonderful as it should have been . it was
[640/1000]	" you 'll learn . " i shook my head . " how 'bout i bring you up to speed on the next few details ? " she shrugged , and finally looked up at me . "
[641/1000]	" no . i do n't , i do n't . . . , " my voice cracked . i needed to find her . now . i could n't be too late . damn it ! the line
[642/1000]	and maybe it was n't entirely misplaced . i have n't been living with my mother since i was about four or three and she came home from the hospital to find me sitting in plain view . but
[643/1000]	he leaned close . " if you think that <EOS> - " my mom , " anything like it is a thing - then i ca n't believe your dad - you did n't know that that would be fine
[644/1000]	" yes , but - " " he is your only friend . i do n't want to know if he wants that , or if it 's because you 're going to f * * k him .
[645/1000]	was her stomach upset ? she shoved the doubts aside . she needed to focus on the task at hand and focus on the fire department and ambulance units . the fire guy was the best in the long
[646/1000]	he dropped to the floor like a sack of cold blood . i dropped down too . i was under his knees and he fell to his back with a whimper . panic hit me like a brick
[647/1000]	" you 're not coming back into the house , " he said sternly , then jerked the weapon away from her and bolted into the house . her gaze flew wildly around her . she was sure she
[648/1000]	" here ! look ! " the doctor had a little girl sitting on his lap and was holding her close close . the little girl was looking up to the doctor and crying . " i love
[649/1000]	i am the first to say that it could have been worse . it could have been that he did n't know what he was saying . maybe because in truth i 'm not really certain i do know either
[650/1000]	it was a good thing she did n't , too . " nothing . we just have n't eaten yet and - " " then why are we trying ? " " my point is we have n't
[651/1000]	both ladies of house ren oux came closer . still holding hands , elend nodded toward the room 's entrance . " may we enter ? " even more stunned , lady ren oux stepped back . inside ,
[652/1000]	" no , but you might want to leave a note to make that happen . " i nodded . " i 'll move where i can . " " we 'd better go in , though .
[653/1000]	" i 'm the one standing in front of you . " then she was gone . " and there i was . a kid who had to admit to stealing cars . <EOS> - ha ! "
[654/1000]	he grinned . " that is what it is . " " and how can you still be in love with her ? " " i love her . all of her . " " and the
[655/1000]	" you should get two extra tickets . the one in the car next to yours . " she eyed him , her eyes serious . she was determined to do her friends a favor . " and
[656/1000]	no more tears , just her arms . he 'd given her the safety she 'd always wanted but had never asked . he was willing to let her leave the safety of his protection . but then she 'd
[657/1000]	" yes . " " can i see it ? " he asked , reaching for the package . she handed it to him . for a minute he was quiet , then he tore open the
[658/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " " they left the ship . " " they , what ? why ? " " captain general of the uss ro le playing islands was n't there to guide us
[659/1000]	i was n't sure if she was lying about that or not . i walked to the bedroom door and opened it . it was almost two in the morning and i was already bored out of my mind
[660/1000]	something in him tightened toward this . she was n't going to be intimidated by any of them , and all of them would be , if the roles were reversed . or if she just did n't recognize things
[661/1000]	finally they were out again , and at her door where she paused waiting for him , he picked up his pace and they ran up the block until she could scream back that she was alright . he was
[662/1000]	" why do n't we start with an easy one . " he nodded and she was in front of his door in two steps , moving slowly , deliberately to avoid going any deeper into the house .
[663/1000]	my eyes widened . " you wanted to play with people 's heads ? that 's different . " " are n't you the expert on the game ? " i narrowed my eyes . " since when
[664/1000]	" what ? " she gasped . " i did n't want you to feel like a princess , " he said , almost ashamed of the way her eyes sparkled . " i have another dress on
[665/1000]	" he knew . he knew and he killed . i do n't understand what - " i do n't know what i 've done . or what we will do at this point . but if i do
[666/1000]	" i 'll show it to you , " i said as i started for the door . as i started to reach for the doorknob , an angry voice echoed out , " do n't you ever ever do
[667/1000]	" i can not , " i tell him . " only you can . you are the reason i came here . " me . he turns his head to look at me . " i am not
[668/1000]	you . me . no one . a voice in her head . that 's what she was trying to keep safe from , but it was n't just the truth . part of her was trying to cling
[669/1000]	" we 've got a fight , " he said , pointing over to the far corner where a black - clad figure was circling the cluster of people . after a few seconds though , the stranger ducked back
[670/1000]	i stepped from the living room and up the stairs . the room was long and narrow . the furniture was cheap , vinyl , and mismatched . there was a lot of glass on the floor that mirrored the
[671/1000]	" and you 've done that , have n't you ? " he asked suddenly . " i 've not done it yet . " he took a step forward , his hands flexing at his sides ,
[672/1000]	" yes . " she leaned up and her lips brushed against his , before she pulled away , " yes ... " chapter nine - the battle the man sitting across from the man was an anomaly
[673/1000]	" what is it ? " she asked . the other man said , " it 's all part of the game . you die - that 's what you do . you die in the real world where
[674/1000]	but we did n't finish this until he went outside with his beer , the door closed and he was back . he said he would come back as soon as we had all the stuff . but , i
[675/1000]	" your presence here for the time being , " the wizard said . " give me my book . please . " with a sigh , cole followed the wizard toward the door , stopping in front of
[676/1000]	he opened the door and stepped into the room . she was seated at her desk , doing something on her computer . " alex , hi , " he said , walking around to her side of the
[677/1000]	" you think ? " there was pride in his tone . " i 'm listening . " why do i have to be the one to know everything ? " i know you can sense the danger
[678/1000]	" how could you do such a thing without wanting to hurt them ? " " i do n't know what you 're talking about , " i told her . " do n't you ever touch me again
[679/1000]	" are you okay , sir ? " the driver asked , smiling a bit . " fine , stay down . shit ! " his voice broke out in a cry , and in moments he threw
[680/1000]	" it 's okay . i know why you 're here . i got here faster than you think . " " i need you for two days of surveillance , " said agent crawford , breaking his silence
[681/1000]	one that will not die with his fellow animals you will lose to your master . it must be killed . " " i am , " said henry without hesitation . " the one good thing that
[682/1000]	i nodded . " and we have no business here , " she said , " if any are . " " is a family meeting in the office ? " " not unless they hear something
[683/1000]	" i wo n't hurt them , " he assured me as he gently laid me back on my feet next to the tub . " that 's right , " i whispered , looking at the floor .
[684/1000]	but what about the rest of us ? if you 're a guy , no self - respecting guy would walk away from a challenge . if you 're a girl , no self - respecting guy would . you
[685/1000]	the next day i did n't see him again until the following day . i remember i was just a little embarrassed the way he looked at me . he came to my apartment in a sleek black jag
[686/1000]	" i would have come sooner , " mike said . " was n't that the reason i came back for the book ? " " no , the only reason you came back for the book was to
[687/1000]	" you 're a big fan of him , are n't you ? " " i am . <EOS> ... one of the perks of the job . " her grin flashed at him . " why are
[688/1000]	" he said if i was going to get what i wanted , i would have to get someone who i could trust . " " you trust him ? " she nodded . " why do you
[689/1000]	i had the strongest urge to run , for a minute or two , and then i let myself be dragged along by them , forcing myself through the broken stone arch . into the main tunnel , and i
[690/1000]	" oh , i got carried away , " i say , my mouth suddenly dry despite the hot air . " i 'm just like you , " he says , cupping my cheeks , <EOS> fucking my
[691/1000]	" for me . " he 'd wanted her and taken her and now got the chance . " now , get your hands off her . " " sorry , lover , i 'm doing my damnedest for
[692/1000]	" you are my other half , so that 's a good thing . " " i know , son . is there anything you want to tell me ? " adam had forgotten , and he almost laughed
[693/1000]	" a very very fine meal . thank you , " said the king , bowing his head again and turning right . a few seconds later his horse reared and its rider was pinned to the ground ,
[694/1000]	after the initial shock , the first thing she was able to do was to shout so that her friend could hear her . " please let me talk to him - for god 's sake , let me talk
[695/1000]	* * * it was night by the time he reached the cottage where alice was waiting for him . he got out of the car , walked up the yard and rapped at the door . the
[696/1000]	' no , ' said the boy , ' i do n't want to know anything about it . ' he spoke as if he were speaking to a child , but i understood him perfectly , i did
[697/1000]	" what about him ? " i asked , turning in my seat . " yeah , " jared mused , running his hand through my hair . " you 're the one who told him to behave but
[698/1000]	" what can i expect ? " lily chuckled . " how does an extra ten more times a day save someone from drowning ? " " yes , but there is n't that much to go on
[699/1000]	" what is , sweetheart ? " mike finally found his voice . " what you 're doing . you 're moving out . " " i 'm moving back into my room . " he shifted his
[700/1000]	' how about the black diamond ? ' ' it 's not in london . ' ' oh . that 's fine then . i 'm sorry i brought it up . ' she took out several crumpled
[701/1000]	" let 's not bother her with all this , " his mother says , and i can see him thinking : what if she 's wrong ? what if she does n't see it at all ? he
[702/1000]	" i do n't know how my mom does it . we did n't know ? " " well , i 'm sure she has a very good explanation . " grace thought over her thoughts . " there
[703/1000]	something about this one says she 's not quite my type . but maybe it 's just too late for me , or maybe it 's just the way i 'm wired . i feel less certain than when i
[704/1000]	" hi . " all the air was suddenly driven out of his lungs . " thank god you 're here . " she smiled but her body was still pale . he searched her face and looked for
[705/1000]	" you want to go ahead and have a drink and discuss what exactly we just saw ? " " nah , it 's nothing like that . we 'll be gone less than an hour , so i
[706/1000]	" well , you can pick it up tomorrow . " " you 'd give me the name of the person who 's using you for an interrogation ? why in the world would that happen ? "
[707/1000]	" okay . do you want to go to dinner or do you want to do it in town ? i want you to meet my friends first . " " i 'm good , i 'm good .
[708/1000]	he raised an eyebrow at me , and i smiled . " yeah , it 's good . " " so how am i supposed to get down from this damn tree ? " " that is the
[709/1000]	" yeah . " i smile crookedly at him . that smile is kind of infectious . i do n't know how his eyes can even look the same yet look the same . no one can look the way
[710/1000]	who the hell would write that ? i called again , hoping to receive an answer and hoped they had n't taken a taxi . i started to pick up my phone when it vibrated in my hand
[711/1000]	i stepped back from both of them and shoved my hands through my hair in frustration . " i 'm going to call the police , " i whispered to cole for the first time . he did n't
[712/1000]	" well , then , perhaps you 'll find another chance . " " your highness , it is my duty - " " a duty that i need you to find an old friend . "
[713/1000]	they saw the huge figure of the chief of the tribe at the western gate , and then they saw the men at the gate , and the chief shouted a command . one great arm of the chief
[714/1000]	" as you wish . " his eyes never left mine and my heart sank as no part of me knew what to think or even know what to do with it . with a slow sexy smirk , he
[715/1000]	i pulled on my shorts and a t - shirt and made my way out of the house to do something to occupy my time before i got to the farm . they had a new cow in about two
[716/1000]	" in other words , there 's no privacy whatsoever in my bedroom , " i reply with a smile . " so you just follow me wherever we 're going . " " this is n't going to
[717/1000]	" but you are not here , " said the woman . " no , i 'm not " , said esk , putting the book into her pocket . " i will , i promise " .
[718/1000]	" ah ! " said the old gentleman , as though surprised . he walked over and pressed a hand to the side of chris 's face . " i 'm sorry to have to hurt you , young man
[719/1000]	" well , we really do n't want to scare them , " mike said , " but we really do need to get down to the store . now , you go down with mike , patty and i
[720/1000]	" this is your choice , no more . i support you . " i tell her . " thanks . " she says with a smile . " and no matter who you decide to be with
[721/1000]	" all i 'm saying is it 's easy to get you into such situations . " " you never said anything about my having to get into any situations . " " no , i never said
[722/1000]	" that 's easy for you to say , was n't it ? " he snapped . " after all , you were n't the only one caught in the jaws of the beast ... " " do n't
[723/1000]	no shit . after the door had closed , she blinked , shocked that he did that the other night . and knowing she was the first person who 'd done it . then again , if
[724/1000]	suddenly , the roar of noise faded . something was missing . i looked out the window , watching as the three remaining white things raced down the pathway . they circled the mansion , each of them with
[725/1000]	" no , it 's just that ... it 's a great idea . especially since i think i feel like we can actually get everything , all of my memories of my grandparents , past . " "
[726/1000]	he held out his hand to her as he studied her face , searching for some sign of his mother , praying that she was alive in any way . she had to be , had to be . even
[727/1000]	' listen , i tried to be nice , you know that , but this is - ' ' you ca n't even begin to express your feelings ? ' ' not in words . i just say
[728/1000]	he nodded . " well , that explains a lot . " " at least , " i said . " i think i know who killed my father . " " the blond guy in the room
[729/1000]	" or maybe he just ca n't do it , " said dormer . " he 's been locked up for years , but at least for one day he 's alive . " elena clapped her hands together
[730/1000]	she looked at him as if his expression was alien on her . then she reached out a hand and touched his cheek . ash froze at the contact - as much from the touch as he was from the
[731/1000]	i took in a deep breath . " i told him . he just looked like he could die , that he 'd been poisoned . and that i loved him more than he could stand . " my voice
[732/1000]	another pause . " well , i can explain things to you better . my people have information that may give you some kind of leverage . with these papers , your chances of getting a fix on the location
[733/1000]	but they all knew he would n't be able to leave . he pulled out of her wet heat , watched her face as the pleasure began to build , watched with a hollow ache in his stomach as
[734/1000]	" fine . " all the while i am telling my story to her , i still keep telling myself , " when he was older it was n't so bad . his parents were kind of rough around
[735/1000]	he smiled back . " i should be the one with the gun . " he stepped into the living room . " it 's the easiest way . i trust you to protect me . " we slipped
[736/1000]	" so ? " " so it must be the baby , " she said . " this last few days have made the two of you think everything is going to be okay ? " " i
[737/1000]	" thank god , " i let out a breath . " and i do n't think you 'd have a chance unless i offered to buy the cabin . " " yeah . that would scare the living
[738/1000]	" we need to get you out of there , " sam told her . " do you know how long you are staying at the shelter ? " she asked . " several hours , " jack
[739/1000]	now who is smiling ? am i grinning ? i do n't know . i do n't know . but i was smiling big as i watched her , the way the moon shines through the clouds . she
[740/1000]	" well , where are you going ? " asked rose . " back to the tree house . something is happening . i 've got to warn him . " the next day rose climbed up the
[741/1000]	" i have something for you . " he came into the office and handed over the pink note . it was attached to a paper label and held the note in his hand . " i hate this
[742/1000]	he was glad that she was dressed . she was so beautiful . all that was missing was her leather jacket she was carrying . that she had n't torn off the heavy cotton was the only sign that she
[743/1000]	then , the door opened and her father 's voice resonated through the room . " my darling beth ! " she turned and saw him standing there wearing jeans and a sweater . he looked incredibly handsome ,
[744/1000]	" hello , this is rachel ! how are you ? " " i 'm fine , rachel ... " rachel lied . " just call me rachel . " " you 're having a rough day ,
[745/1000]	" is she bad , daddy ? " i asked as he opened the door . he smiled and kissed me on the head . " she is n't bad . " he opened the door . " come
[746/1000]	as i started towards my cell , both girls got out of the car and ran over . one carried a wooden ball the size of a baseball bat . the other was clearly holding a baseball bat . both
[747/1000]	it was when he 'd run headfirst into the tree trunk , knocked it over and dropped his sword that he 'd managed to gather his wits because he was fairly sure everything around him was now just a sheet
[748/1000]	we spent the next few hours working on the details of the ambush . it was an uneventful day , as usual . the main thing for my mind took over , was getting information . i felt like they
[749/1000]	' hey man , do what you got ta do ... yeah there was a woman out there on the edge of the cliffs , not far from where i found you , but a pretty big one , maybe

[766/1000]	" you 're playing with fire . " he had to give her points in her efforts to get him riled up again . " i am not . " " you are , " he contradicted .

[802/1000]	but all she had to do was open her mouth and ask . one thing , however , could not be denied . " was my husband , cezar , " she said , her voice a strangled whisper .

[900/1000]	i wanted to tell him i did n't trust him , that he could n't lead you on so easily , but i could n't quite look him in the eyes because the thing inside me was very excited by
[901/1000]	" yeah , it 's very nice . like the room . " " yeah , i know . maybe it 's a test . " " my father could get anyone in this town but you .
[902/1000]	" not at the moment , " he says . " i just did n't realize what . " and then he 's gone , his hand on the doorknob , and the door has slammed shut .
[903/1000]	" i will soon get you to the hospital , " he said in a voice as firm as a father 's will . " we all will . " * * * * * in a soft
[904/1000]	" i 'll make a plate . " " no , thanks . i 'm going to go grab a cup of coffee . i wo n't be here long . " " i know . but someone
[905/1000]	" now let me finish what i 'm trying to say before you go off and leave me here all alone , " i started . he reached down and grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled me
[906/1000]	" like i said , i should be able to manage . i 'm trying to help them understand the concept . " he leaned back to look at me . i shifted in place so i was propped
[907/1000]	" where were you for ? " " i met a witch that ran and hid in a tree a few miles away . " " oh , yes , we were talking and i noticed a little
[908/1000]	" i 've been thinking , " i said as i slid the plate on our lunch table . i glanced out over the ocean and looked up at him . " i 'm confused . why was my dress
[909/1000]	was there some way he could make his father understand what had happened to him ? if he did n't speak up , would they take him away <EOS> no matter how much power he had ? had his mother
[910/1000]	" well , i am going to take out a message for him , " i said . " good luck , " she said with a smile . as i got up from the bed , julie
[911/1000]	" what a jerk , " i responded to the empty air . i walked back inside for some coffee and some cigarettes . i found adam and sat down in a chair across the table . he looked
[912/1000]	the first guy stared openmouthed at the man 's face . he 'd almost forgotten about them . still holding his beer , he gazed around the pub at the patrons , and his mouth dropped open in shock .
[913/1000]	" you should still have the helmet , jake . how about i do n't buy it ? " she said , changing the subject . the sun had set and now they were in the middle of a
[914/1000]	the door opened quietly and closed silently behind rachel . rachel pulled herself out of the water and reached for an emery board , dragging herself out of water . " what are you doing , " garrett demanded
[915/1000]	it was getting dark , and i had n't been able to stop crying around any of my neighbors for the last three hours . i was exhausted in a good , healthy way . i just did n't want
[916/1000]	" all right . " he gave me a sheepish smile . " i gave up trying to do a good job . " i waved the air before grabbing his hand and pulling him into a hug .
[917/1000]	" what 's her name ? " " no idea , " i lie . " that 's it . " i 'm not sure if he catches the hint because he says nothing for a few moments
[918/1000]	" i may have spent my life watching you work , " he said . " i know what you 're like beneath that prim and proper exterior . but if you let me in , i can see beyond
[919/1000]	" but let him think it , " i 'm saying in a tiny voice . " let him hope i 'm a little girl . " " wait and see , " niklas says . i feel
[920/1000]	" i said , do you see her face , mr. wright ? " she said . " yes , i see her face , i see a face , " he said , and the old woman took
[921/1000]	" yes , it does . " he looked down into those beautiful eyes of hers . " how have you been with your brother ? " " you know i - " " are you afraid ?
[922/1000]	" when was the last time you used your laptop ? " " i do n't need the damn thing . " i pulled at it as if it were a magnet , pulling it toward me . "
[923/1000]	he did n't say anything and simply stared down at her . she stared down at him . so many sensations , so many emotions came off him . her heart raced at the sheer intensity of the emotion and
[924/1000]	so to speak . " the waitress , being rather tall , began to move back and forth on the kitchen counter . she was laughing and the grin on her face was so wide it looked more like
[925/1000]	" i think you may have lost the opportunity to speak with your family , " <EOS> only briefly , as he could feel his way for a few moments , and finally as if to say , " the
[926/1000]	a sudden wave of fear threatened to overcome her . for the first time , she remembered the pain she had felt in trying to stop the ship . it would have been like leaving with the last piece of
[927/1000]	" you mean you have a twin ? " " yep . you , " i said . " you 're telling me , " trenton said , coming to stand next to me . " that 's
[928/1000]	" stop your whining and turn around , " said the voice again . jessica whirled around and saw the man moving with surprising speed . he was taller than eli , standing almost the same height . she
[929/1000]	it said here that there was nothing less than the man who invented the language that is a musical instrument , who also invented a song . i had n't even asked if he was a singer . all
[930/1000]	he glanced at me as i sat there , holding on with both hands . i was n't that tall . i 'd put a little too much weight on . i should have looked around . instead , i
[931/1000]	it was hard to say who 'd stepped forward to greet him when there was a deafening eruption of applause . he was called the moment he stepped upon the stage . " thank you for attending ! "
[932/1000]	" yeah , but ... " i looked around , searching for other options . " but what ? " " my mom actually did get my birthday a week ago . " " what ? "
[933/1000]	" well , i 'm glad i got there early enough , because i did n't . " he paused , and i could hear him sigh again . " it 's not like i have n't been here before
[934/1000]	she took one last , desperate grab , and brought back her hand high , reaching in with her free arm to grab the blade . it was the least she could do because she could n't believe what had
[935/1000]	" now why would i do that ? " " because you 're my ex - dad ! " " that was n't part of my goal . " " i know . i know . i
[936/1000]	his heart pounded hard when she met the green sky and waves of black hair . he was close enough to the water 's edge that he could see the tiny bubbles that rose from it , floating . "
[937/1000]	" who 's that ? " " i do n't know . i see you with her now , you being close . " i shrugged . obviously , i was n't an expert on this marriage business .
[938/1000]	" i agree . " " can we arrange things ? " he whispered . i nodded , taking his words seriously . " i think so . how do you want to go about this ? "
[939/1000]	he looked at her . he 'd suspected that she might know more than she let on , knew more about the woman he loved , but he had n't expected that she might also know more of her husband
[940/1000]	" then it 's a real estate scam . maybe in a small - time neighborhood somewhere in florida , in some coastal town . i bet on it . maybe it owns half of the market , and ca
[941/1000]	she smiled , knowing he could n't see her , but it reached her face anyway . " very funny , captain . as you are aware , the king is a powerful man , who is also a king
[942/1000]	he was sure there was something to it , but beyond that he was n't sure . he knew what his own opinion of the man had been growing , but something about it was also unsettling , and he
[943/1000]	" what is this ? " " a book ? " said brutha . " it 's written in the om nian language . it 's - " " are you a servant of vorbis ? "
[944/1000]	we go home and my mom - she finally told me it was going to be okay - is waiting by my bedroom door with that sad look on her face i 've seen a hundred times , and her
[945/1000]	" she 's my wife . my wife who is about to leave for her honeymoon . if she does n't meet her baby right after , i 'll go crazy ! " in the aftermath of their wild
[946/1000]	" she has no idea what she 's in for tonight , " i said sadly , and she looked as devastated as i felt . " i have to go . " i grabbed my purse , and as
[947/1000]	" that 's nice , " melissa replied . " yeah , really nice : we 're all gon na be all over him like candy today . " " i hope so , he 's something special
[948/1000]	he 'd already had the men talk . <EOS> the women had waited to hear of his exploits . " it 's a start , " he said , and the man followed before he could question them further
[949/1000]	there were a whole lot more words . there was n't as many of the other words . just two . " where did you learn to speak french like that ? " i asked him . " and
[950/1000]	" does it really matter ? " " not , " i said , " until we 're married . but unless not , this is the honeymoon period for you . " " whatever , " she
[951/1000]	" let 's stop with the " good old days " and get down to serious business . it 's been awhile since i saw you today , ben . " she winked but did n't seem to be pleased
[952/1000]	i looked quickly to the mirror across from me , but i could n't see anything more than the outline of my face now . " i guess i should just accept that , " i said , my voice
[953/1000]	they were interrupted by a sharp cough . " what is it ? " harry looked over him . " the door , " came this from above and from beyond the door , and they looked up
[954/1000]	but his expression was not all you could see . " you and i know the score . " i stared at him . " what score ? " the corner of his lips lifted . " you
[955/1000]	" just something simple , " she said . " it 's not like i have anything else going on here . " " i saw some online pictures of you on the web . that 's pretty serious
[956/1000]	" maybe we 'll find something better in here , " she says , looking around . her voice stops when we enter the room . she turns to me . " are you expecting something ? " she
[957/1000]	" have you used the condom ? " she asked , and he knew it was not a rhetorical question . her voice was edged with fear , and then she pulled away , but did n't try to help
[958/1000]	the phone was the last thing on her mind when she opened her hotel room door . there stood ryan , and her heart sank as she realized she must look like an utter fool dressed up as an ordinary
[959/1000]	" that 's not all i 'm asking . ' my ' brother does n't like me , " ian said . " he 's protective of jack , and i do n't fit in with his family . i
[960/1000]	" i can see that . " she sighed . her shoulders slumped again . " i 'm glad you finally finished your lecture , though . really glad . you had me worried there for a while . "
[961/1000]	" yes , sir , " she said . " well , one day we 'll need it , " he said , and gave the telephone a touch of finality . he turned to the others .
[962/1000]	some days they just loved this guy . there was n't much to do in the house to do . the only thing to do was watch ' the news ' and ' the new ' movie on tv .
[963/1000]	" if you are truly trying to make me feel better , " he said with a grin of genuine charm , " you only need to ask . " " thank god , " anna said , smiling
[964/1000]	" how did you find out about us ? " he asked , trying to get out of the conversation that seemed to be coming this way . " where are we going ? " julie 's arms came
[965/1000]	" no , baby girl , everything 's great . i 'm out . " " you 're outside already ? " i looked up from where i was in the middle of scrubbing up the dishes .
[966/1000]	" no , i did n't think - " " do n't be silly , " he murmured . " have n't you ever seen a cat ? " " when i was a little girl , i
[967/1000]	i 'm stunned and momentarily shocked that my father will stoop to such an atro city towards me . " you want me to play with her ? she loves me , luca . " my father eyes me
[968/1000]	their mouths connected in a fiery exchange , and the rest of the world faded away . claire gasped into his mouth , felt the slick heat of his tongue on hers , and he tasted like fire .
[969/1000]	" so what do you want to do ? " he looks at me , his eyes are big , full of fear . " i thought we could set up camp . " " good . it 's
[970/1000]	his gut turned over , the ground shaking beneath his feet . the thing in the back of that ancient , rotting body moaned as it was swallowed alive , but there was n't any sound in the night .
[971/1000]	" for you ? " i ask , surprised . " yes . " " now you do n't have to , do you ? " i 'm actually touched that he would even find that interesting ,
[972/1000]	he groaned . " do n't lie to me , blake . and we really need to discuss our conversation over dinner tonight . " he gave a rueful smile . " that 's not going to happen
[973/1000]	" what 's with all the crap around here ? seriously . " " they call this school a school to protect people , " i said . " they think the school is full of crazies running around
[974/1000]	she smiles and i know that she knows exactly what i mean by it , and she knows what i 'm referring to , but she has to give it some thought . " some people are n't all
[975/1000]	" i should have known better , " i said . she pulled me close and in this moment , my biggest regret was the fact i could n't see cassidy 's face . " now it 's my
[976/1000]	" hey ! " a voice hailed them from behind when they got a few steps to the back of the room . one of the nurses from the first shift over . she was a short woman in her
[977/1000]	" really ? " i looked at him surprised . " i think you like him a little too much . " " that 's not true . " he grinned at me and then winked . " besides
[978/1000]	" i do not know . the only sound is from me and my thoughts . " " hmmm , let me hear them . " it was quiet for a moment then . then she said ,
[979/1000]	" is it more than a little over a year ? " " why ? " max asked , perplexed . he 'd never been one to play games . " there 's something i 've noticed .
[980/1000]	i walk through with my eyes on the floor as i walk towards my room . a sudden pounding sound comes from beside me , and i jump a bit , looking up to see a body sprawled in the
[981/1000]	" do n't worry , sweetheart , this is just new . " i sat down on his lap and adjusted myself so i was directly across his lap . " i 'll tell everyone you 're here . "
[982/1000]	" for what ? " this time , his question was louder . " for loving you . " " and that would be ... ? " he repeated , his voice still soft but his eyes still
[983/1000]	" yeah you , and are you guys even sure you want to do this ? " kevin asked with a frown . " i just do n't want someone to die . i want to go home .
[984/1000]	" i 'm sorry . you 're with his father , i thought you should know . " it sounded incredibly contrived , though . i could n't imagine adam being more likely to harm someone than i was
[985/1000]	i turned to her . " can we ... ? try and talk to him ? i mean , would he talk to us ? " " he would . " " would he make me a
[986/1000]	" how could you ! " she cried , horrified . " i know your mother 's not your mum or dad or any of those people . so i do n't need an excuse . i 'm not
[987/1000]	i 'm afraid i 'm being a jackass , but i ca n't very well deny the pleasure of having ty 's eyes on me . his eyes are just too beautiful . ty lets his gaze roam over
[988/1000]	" they were in the lobby of the capitol building , just outside of the lobby ... i got them out of the building as soon as i realized what that guy 's been doing on the rooftop . my
[989/1000]	" no , you listen to me right now . do n't ever lie to me like that again . " " sorry . i promise wo n't , " i say , trying to placate her as best
[990/1000]	" well they should be happy , at least for a while , " he said , not sounding happy at all . he sat for a few seconds and then looked straight at me , his green eyes bright
[991/1000]	" did you hear that ? " " sure did . " he put his hand on her back and pushed her to move . she was breathing heavy . his body heat was burning her clothing away .
[992/1000]	i had to agree with him that the house was a nice , quaint family home , but i also knew the house was n't always that way . i 'd been there before and survived it . it had
[993/1000]	" oh , stop . what an awful shame . and for the luck i could have given mr. car roll when he offered me this if i only did n't have such a complicated situation on my hands .
[994/1000]	" let 's try to talk one last time first , okay ? my friend , " said the lady , with a voice that sounded like she was trying to raise a voice . " for you to feel
[995/1000]	" you should 've married her years ago , " he growled , yanking on my arm . i held on onto him , not wanting him to leave me behind . " sorry , logan . i
[996/1000]	" good , " replied gregor . " now go . " luxa squeezed boots 's shoulder and started walking to the head of the line . it was very quiet . if she could keep herself from screeching
[997/1000]	" i 'm here , " i say . she laughs and looks around the room . " i thought we were doing this in the kitchen ? i do n't think anyone 's around . your mom ca
[998/1000]	the day was so crowded that there was no time to think about the task at hand . it had to be accomplished . everyone had gathered in the dining hall . jamie was seated at two places and
[999/1000]	if they had n't , he would have . but with nothing else to do , he went back into the house and to the corner office . the doctor had given him strict instructions that he should be able
