[19/1000]	a short , balding man led the conversation . " the question is , what is a werewolf doing here ? " mara thought for a moment . this was the part she had been dreading ever since her
[20/1000]	" that 's not true . i want us to work together . " her voice shook and she kept her gaze on his . " but not right now . " after a beat , he finally admitted
[21/1000]	and when it happened it was n't bad . she was n't nearly as sick with her stomach as she 'd been . when he dropped her off at her bedroom and she was unpacking her clothes ,
[22/1000]	her father had spent most of his time in scotland - the only time he had spent at the ranch was when he was too hungover to worry about business . he 'd never returned to the ranch and

[25/1000]	" me neither , " she said coolly . " how many more meetings does he need ? " gray asked her to cut to the chase . gray felt as if he were being forced to apologize
[26/1000]	all that i really want to do and all that i can hate , is to crawl into bed with him and fall asleep , but after a few moments , and he has no answer , i finally end
[27/1000]	" this way , " i said , leading her over to the kitchen . we walked past mrs. jenkins . " is there anything else i can get you , ma'am ? " i asked , getting up and
[28/1000]	maybe dad did just sit back and let his father and i have our one - year anniversary . but that was n't something that happened often . i can still remember seeing dad on the couch with dad ,
[29/1000]	" why did you think i was n't mad by the way you were with mom ? " he 's silent . " you could have told me , and i would n't have done anything . "

[35/1000]	i nod , because i know i ca n't say no . " i do n't mind if you come . " her eyes widen comically and she looks unsure as she looks back at the apartment . "

[43/1000]	' what do you think ? ' i asked her . ' i 'm not expecting much . i know it must be a long shot but i 'm hoping that this thing will be able to be stopped
[44/1000]	" and this one 's yours , " i pointed out . " you bought a baby . " " that is n't what you told me , " i mumbled . he moved closer , close
[45/1000]	" i 'll tell you about it later , " he promised . " first i have an idea . what do you think ? " " we 'll see , " she said , glancing across the room
[46/1000]	the second time she threw herself at the stranger , he made no secret of his determination and took several steps back from her , obviously bracing himself for a verbal response . she smiled at him , showing

[51/1000]	" we 're okay . " i looked up into his strong face , the light from the parking lot hitting his eyes . " why do you ask ? " he stared at me for a long moment
[52/1000]	" no . " the word came out as a whisper , and i felt for any movement in the room . not a sound . " please , " i whispered again . " do n't leave me .
[53/1000]	" thank you , " i said weakly . " that 's amazing . " " it is now , but , if we 're to do this , we need to be careful not to get caught .
[54/1000]	" and be aware of what happens when you allow me to leave . " " what the hell are you talking about ? " she screamed , suddenly furious with herself . she spun on her heel and
[55/1000]	" what do you think ? " he asked her . " it 's good . " she nodded in agreement , not getting the opportunity to work her way through the pages the way he did . she
[56/1000]	" you 're trying to say you do n't want to take the shot ? you know i can call an ambulance , if you want . " " stay ? " he is clearly not convinced . "
[57/1000]	with such a large hole in the ground , well over three metres deep , it was impossible to climb anywhere . it had become evident that the most likely way out was up . not quite a hundred metres
[58/1000]	" we were never really a couple , " i snapped . " just the same , i can tell that you have to be the only guy they 've dated . " " oh . " "
[59/1000]	" i thought he wanted her back . " " then he betrayed you , " tavi said . " he told us how serious you were . he used the only way the crows can , using her

[61/1000]	the next morning , i stood up in my room . my phone rang , it was jay . " hi , " i answered sleepily . " my wife is in the ambulance , " he said
[62/1000]	" we will do away with this and take it as a small prize . " her voice was as pleasant as it was seductive . " that 's a lovely offer , " jason responded . then without
[63/1000]	" well , of course you 're not . do you love me ? " his voice takes on a slightly pleading tone . what is he talking about ? i pull back . " yes , i
[64/1000]	his gaze met mine . " yes . " my throat worked hard and i could tell he was struggling for patience . " you 're going to have to keep pushing . i 'm really tired . "

[67/1000]	she hesitated and stepped a few steps away from him , then nodded . her fingers were trembling ; each one was as rigid as glass . her face still had a ghastly , blank , deathly beautiful smile .
[68/1000]	i knew how to work my mother 's business , but <EOS> and stuff like that . it was a new technique i had taken in high school . it was n't that i cared what would please me .
[69/1000]	but he did still think about the future . now , the prospect of someone , anyone , challenging him , challenging him and looking at him like he was a piece of dung that had fallen off his horse
[70/1000]	i could tell the moment he heard the car . his body tensed instinctively . " it 's me , " i whispered . he moved toward me with slow , sure steps , and when we stood
[71/1000]	" she 's going back to her family . " i looked at eric , then at tara . i wanted to scream up the staircase . this was n't a real kidnapping ! they just had to be
[72/1000]	" well , if the man will not tell you , then perhaps you do not know . " " he has been a long time ago , " i said . " yes ? " "
[73/1000]	well , it was n't as if we did n't have time to have sex , we did . but this was n't just a relationship . it was sex . a relationship . something that was n't supposed to

[75/1000]	" yeah ? " i whispered . " you gon na be too ... busy with your other ... jobs . with your other ... other thing . " " you got it , " he promised .
[76/1000]	" i thought a lot about that book , " i said , " because it must have been a good book for a psychiatrist . i knew the story from a book dad told me . he gave it
[77/1000]	" yeah , " i say . " that 's how we do things when we have problems . " " seems to me that you 're going to be dealing with these ' problems ' <EOS> even ,

[79/1000]	the next day , when they got back to the warehouse , there was a letter taped to the door . it read simply , " when you can , take the next flight , coming to san francisco .
[80/1000]	" i have to get out of here . " she tugged on his arm . " it is daylight out here . " " i know . " " why do you keep calling me that
[81/1000]	and just that quickly , the room was quiet again , even the muffled sounds of the two children arguing , as if they had finally acknowledged each other for a change , a change of heart . "
[82/1000]	" yeah ... yeah , that 's what i said . i was really irritated , dad , " ari said , trying not to sound overly concerned . " let 's just leave it at that . "
[83/1000]	" what ? you 're leaving ? ' " the roads are supposed to be hard . there are tons of people . ' i did n't have to say why , it was obvious what he was about
[84/1000]	" just some of the pictures i saw . " just some of the pictures ? " why did you see what i was looking at in the restaurant ? " " i had to get a job

[88/1000]	" but this is better than an audition with a pair of binoculars . " " oh , it is , " he replied in his best accent , mimicking the accent in an effort to sound british .
[89/1000]	" he was n't too happy about his appearance , " i said . " it was in new york . " " so that 's how it happened ? " " yes . that 's how
[90/1000]	" what good will it do ? " " i do n't know . you will know . i 'm so scared we 'll both die . i 'm so scared .... " the darkness around them was
[91/1000]	" that 's not as simple as you might think . <EOS> , we have also been known to be known for being secretive . we have been known to have an argument amongst ourselves , as a whole ,
[92/1000]	" have you had breakfast ? " he asked her . " yes , i had coffee at a friend 's house for breakfast . " she was n't dressed for her business , nor did she want people
[93/1000]	she is wearing a white tunic with leather cuffs and tied at the elbow . a black belt holds the blue headband in the middle which is decorated with a pair of brown and black patterned bracelets with small metal
[94/1000]	" but i have a better idea . " i stood up from the bed and opened the closet . " i think i found the perfect hat . " i looked down , my heart thumping with anticipation
[95/1000]	" at what point did i decide you were perfect ? " she asked . " once . ever . but since then you have n't . you wo n't let me see your face , either . "
[96/1000]	no one made me a slave , and i could n't believe this would happen to me , but i 'd been born to feel how the world ran , and i knew what this was - freedom .
[97/1000]	" do n't be an idiot , " she snarled . " what ? " " you 're dead to me . " there now , it 's just the truth . his smile widened , easing
[98/1000]	the man nodded and took a step forward , his arms outstretched . " my name is tom , " he said . " i know , " said tom . " how 's someone supposed to know what
[99/1000]	" can you explain to me why you want to go outside with me now ? " it 's suddenly very quiet . " why , because i 'm not ready to do this ? " "
[100/1000]	that night i found some people in the bar , listening to the club music , and so i walked over to a table by the dance floor , grabbed an ice cube and began to slur p a little
[101/1000]	i had to admit , that sounded pretty good . we talked for a while longer , while i tried to think of my next step . chapter 13 heven " just thinking , " sam

[103/1000]	" me , too , " grace answered . " for now then . " he pointed to the woman . " will you call on her for me when you come in tomorrow ? " his tone was
[104/1000]	" he 's about to get married today , " she told me as we crossed the room . " no way . i do n't ever want to see this boy married . he 's really not suitable
[105/1000]	the answer was yes ; it was the answer , so i smiled and hugged him . " i love you too , " i said . chapter eight my second - period spanish class during high school
[106/1000]	" that 's okay . i 'm not so bad . i had no choice . i have to work , but it 's no hardship . " he laughed in spite of himself . " do n't pull
[107/1000]	" i 'd like to say i disagree with your methods . but it is n't necessary without the testimony of the others . this child was born by the witch queen , and this child 's powers are gone
[108/1000]	i found a seat next to the fire and began pouring myself a mug of hot brew from a pot on the stove . " i do n't think i 've ever been happier , " emma said ,
[109/1000]	her head jerked toward the man in question , her eyes wide . " you do not like me then ? " " oh , i adore you , " he said , leaning against a nearby table .
[110/1000]	" the fact you are married to another man does n't even register , " i told him . " i 've got one of those , " he retorted . " and you feel like he means that
[111/1000]	he takes the step and pauses at the stairs . i drop away from my camera . i 'm not sure if he wants to climb down or not , but both of us ca n't take another step
[112/1000]	" we are leaving , " he says tightly , taking her arm to lead her out , but when he opens the door they find andrew laying on the couch and a sleeping rachel curled into his side .
[113/1000]	" yeah , it was just a quick trip all around . " she shrugged . " i 'm a little surprised you wanted to talk to me . " " me ? why ? " i wondered why
[114/1000]	" if we keep this up i 'll be all alone , " he said , then glanced away . " i want to help , jack . i need to understand . " " i feel the
[115/1000]	" okay , but we do n't want to draw any more attention to you . " " hey , whatever . so you 're here to give me directions to another demon sanctuary ? " " no

[117/1000]	slowly i pushed myself up , and the table caught my weight . the floor wobbled as i rose to my feet . " trent , no ! " i said , then gasped as the spell hit me .

[119/1000]	" did you think i would n't know ? " he asked , and i tensed , thinking that maybe he had made a mistake in not telling me . a slow smile spread across my face , and
[120/1000]	" what is it ? " she cried . i was on my knees behind her . her naked body was pressed against the back of my neck from the front ; her knees lifted to either side of
[121/1000]	" was it anything serious ? " he asks , his tone holding a hint of anger . i shake my head . " of course not . " he goes back up and stops in front of

[123/1000]	she smiled , his presence so familiar ; she wanted to remember every word he said to her . when he left , she left the office quietly . at one o'clock , <EOS> ... when the bell
[124/1000]	" if you have nothing more to say i 'll just leave . go on home and get some rest . or are you just going out for the evening ? " she looked up from her notepad and realized
[125/1000]	the general 's eyes narrowed , " why , what 's the matter , are n't you hungry ? " " i am not hungry . please lead the way , general . " " the man called
[126/1000]	" no . this will just create a problem for both of them . " " but i have n't had a chance to tell them about you . " he looked at her with a frown . "
[127/1000]	" she knows you like dogs and that you 'll need to take care of her . " " oh . i do n't know . " " then do it . " i shook my head
[128/1000]	" and what was so important that you had to sacrifice yourself to keep mary from knowing ? " " my job . " she shook her head . " it was never , never important to me .
[129/1000]	" what do you mean ? " she turned to face him , her hands clenched at her sides . " no . no , i do n't . you have got to be kidding me ! " "
[130/1000]	" we 'd better go see what the hell 's going on so we can get out of here before that lunatic out there decides to call a tow truck . " " we have n't seen and talked
[131/1000]	" yes , of course . you can join me if you go without me ? " " i would love that . " he looked at her and smiled . she was a beautiful woman , a stunning
[132/1000]	" fine . " she took the mug from me , " but if you do happen to forget to put some ice in the back of your throat during the drive back i 'll have a clean tank full
[133/1000]	the door was unlocked , and without questioning the locks , she pushed through it . the next room was still her grandmother 's . she looked down the hall . it looked to be somewhere between two and
[134/1000]	" you 're gon na be mighty proud of me , honey . " she turned to face him and did a quick double take . " you have n't <EOS> and how gorgeous of those things . "
[135/1000]	" you did well ? " he shrugged , still not looking at me . " i had to . she came first . " he looked back over at me . " now she 's my wife .
[136/1000]	the sun had disappeared over the horizon and her eyes were swimming in tears . she could n't understand why , and it was n't fair . " we 've earned each other , " he said and pulled
[137/1000]	" and i just want to make sure the children have their places here , safe and sound and happy . " i nodded in agreement and watched him close the door behind him . the door made a
[138/1000]	he looked into my eyes and pulled me up . when he let me go , i pulled it across my legs . " i 've found that i like to get my own way with you , "
[139/1000]	" ah , yes . yes . " " i do n't know if i believe everything i 've heard since i left you last night . " " so you disagree with what i suggested that you
[140/1000]	the man 's eyes widened , his lips parting . then he dropped to the ground , turning to look at the old man . " they told me the story , " he stuttered . " do they know
[141/1000]	" do n't bother telling me . i 'm going to be getting up soon . " " but i would like them . " " you 're not taking anything from me . " she 's just
[142/1000]	" you 're not all bad . what it is is n't perfect , but at least you still see him as a father figure . " " i see him out of the corner of my eyes ,
[143/1000]	" i do n't know why you 're always so worried about them . they do n't like you either . " " they were wrong . i would have thought they 'd realize how stupid they are .
[144/1000]	" i may not know everything right now , " he admitted . " but i have a fairly good idea of what happened . " " is it true that you 're dating some sort of lawyer ?
[145/1000]	" yeah , but we were just talking about <EOS> like that . " i replied . " we were not talking about that . " i bit my lip as i took a drag of the cigarette
[146/1000]	but not today , sweetheart . he was not a man prone to weakness . not what was happening . there now ? one moment his hands were caressing her side , the next his whole body was
[147/1000]	at some point , i drift into a dream of her skin and soft hair against my face . i feel dizzy with how attractive and beautiful she looks . i 'm almost asleep when i hear her
[148/1000]	" this is the first time someone has tried to make contact , " i thought out loud . " when ? " " as far as i know , " said walter , raising his glass , "
[149/1000]	at the time , it made me feel horrible , but not that bad . " why are you yelling at her ? " i demanded . " because she does n't know how to use the phone ,
[150/1000]	" you need to go back to your dorm today or it wo n't end well for you , " ryan said . the fact that i was going back to see him made it easier to keep my thoughts
[151/1000]	" i agree completely . i ca n't argue with that . but do n't you think it would be better to take a hike already ! " " well , actually , i said i 'm coming .
[152/1000]	the door opened against another intrusion and another figure strode in . the boy was well known in the group . he was well known for being shy around that woman . she was the mother of the second soldier
[153/1000]	' yes . that first night i came here , it was really weird to spot him , he was walking really fast with his arm around that girl , but ... ' ' well , there he is
[154/1000]	" do n't you like it ? " " it 's perfect . " it is , in a way . this one with her mother was perfect . she liked her mom ; that part mattered less to
[155/1000]	he took her hand . " are you sure you want to , jessie ? " jessie shook her head and sucked on her lower lip . " yes , " she whispered . he pulled her close
[156/1000]	he nods slightly . " he took some samples of my blood , in an accident . he 's a medical policeman . " " ah . that 's fine . " and then : " what about
[157/1000]	" oh , let 's just spend the night here then . that 's all we do tonight , besides hang out in this crazy town . i just need sex . " just sex . she thought back
[158/1000]	" fine . " paul nodded quickly and headed back to the car . beth looked down on the man , who stared up at her with a vacant expression on his face . nothing about him had changed
[159/1000]	" so now i 'm afraid there is no longer one world . " " what does that mean ? " " it means that in order for me to exist as a human being , i must
[160/1000]	" oh ? " " you are not a girl . you are a woman , ' she sniffed . " i will kill you in a heartbeat . " he grinned , suddenly very glad of her
[161/1000]	" does n't look like she 's asleep anymore , " he said . " nah , i caught her this morning at breakfast looking for you . i know <EOS> really wanted to get a burger at the
[162/1000]	just a few weeks ago , when she had thought he was dead , she had thought they would still be friends . she had come to know him . and for what reason she could n't figure , she
[163/1000]	" just so long as you hold up and do n't try to come after me . " " i 'll give you ten minutes to get out of here . i 'm starting to wonder if it was
[164/1000]	" just tell me this , " eddie said , and his tone seemed to say : you would have preferred this , he would not have needed to , he would not have needed to , but you knew
[165/1000]	" who 's that ? " " i 'm not sure , " i admitted . " it 's one of the women over there , too . i did n't recognize her . " " she 's
[166/1000]	" let me worry about that . give him a chance , " she offered , still thinking about what it must have been like living in that house for all these years . the very thought of sharing his
[167/1000]	" you 're the one who insisted that i come here and help pick out a dress , " i remind him with authority . mom 's heels click on the tile as she stalks past us . "
[168/1000]	" there is still a few of us , " she declared . " when we left , we barely managed to escape . we survived just fine . " " i 'm sorry , " my mother said
[169/1000]	for a first time , the guard 's eyes lit up . it seemed the creature felt something for one of them . " you ca n't leave you in here , " he stammered , " there are
[170/1000]	" you 're not from around here , are you , darlin ? " his hold loosened , and he took a step back , the gesture welcoming and kind as he spoke . " welcome to my home .
[171/1000]	" how many people have you seen with her ? " jack asked . " just the one . " jack was still staring out at the ocean , watching the waves hit and kick the shore .
[172/1000]	" ' this is for the safety of my family , in case any harm comes to her . ' " they 'd heard it before , but they 'd only understood it <EOS> then . " she
[173/1000]	but i am not going to push the guy . it would only make things worse , getting too close and hurting him . so i hold myself still just a bit so that he does n't get one
[174/1000]	oh , lord , please do n't let it be really stupid in her book . she felt the heat of one blush run hot up her neck all the way to her face . " he wanted us
[175/1000]	" what ? " i look down . " i have n't slept at all . i did n't even try . " isaac sits still and not moving for a moment . " you 've been awake for
[176/1000]	" i went into the cafeteria at eleven , saw you sitting in the back corner and i knew right away it was you . i had a gut feeling . and i knew - it was the one you
[177/1000]	" how do you know these things ? are you in your true form ? " " no . " " you have a human body ; you are human and therefore a vampire . i 'm sure
[178/1000]	but it was clear that if she had , she had been in love with a man whose only real regret would have been the fact that his heart was not in her bed . as he 'd told her
[179/1000]	" that you , captain wyatt ? you 're making me nervous . " " it 's all right , " he began . then he glanced over at stella . " and stella ? " " mm
[180/1000]	" that 's right ! thanks . " i knew she meant it , although i wished it were in a different way . " i see you brought the bottle back from santa fe . and i
[181/1000]	i had stopped crying . " i know we have n't been together long but you will always know when i 'm not happy . " " if you do n't love me she will hurt you ! "
[182/1000]	they all began to look around the room at each other . no one had a clue where to go . no one had a clue where the hell she was . " we are in grave danger ,
[183/1000]	as i reach the car , he 's still the handsome boy from before . he kneels at the front door . " if this is a joke ? " i sound more bewildered than pissed . " i
[184/1000]	" well i think i would . " " no you would not ! " " i do . " " like you do , not really . " " that is true , " replied
[185/1000]	" does n't matter . your family has no business being in here together . get the hell out . " in a flash i was at the door , tossing all our possessions on the floor and charging
[186/1000]	i was about to leave the closet door open , but he called my name . " if it is a question then , why are you in here ? " i shrugged , because i did n't
[187/1000]	" well , is n't this convenient , " she mutters . " now what ? " " just leave him . " " no . " i throw her chair to the side and hop up
[188/1000]	" where are they ? " " no idea . two of those boys are going in to pack up supplies and bring them back with them . and then they 're supposed to be on their way back
[189/1000]	" yes , sir , " cole said , stepping out of the way , allowing him to pass . cole moved up the steps and into the large foyer , where he got off just as robin joined
[190/1000]	as they passed an ice cream parlor , allison stopped before a huge plate of melted ice cream . she glanced up , as if to say it was time to go . allison waved him on , and for
[191/1000]	" do n't you ? " she asked as she turned out the car and took in the home . it was n't a huge place , more a basement sort of apartment , with two rooms that were open
[192/1000]	i pull up several days later , a half - mile short of the camp site before a small church , painted the same shade of khaki and white and a two - story building with a chimney and a
[193/1000]	" not unless you 're hungry , or do you need to be in a bar . are you in a position for that ? " " you could ask me that . and who would be saying no
[194/1000]	she 's not sure she likes to find herself stuck in two countries with a long - term boyfriend . her heart is still frozen and i 'm seeing spots . my heart is pounding so hard and fast
[195/1000]	" why ? " she asked , " you seem to be a little more of a man now than you have been , " she added to help him a bit . " and you seem to have a
[196/1000]	" no - o. when you 're all like this ? it 's hard on the body . " oh . she sounded really disappointed . so he grabbed her hips and lifted her skirt a little higher . his
[197/1000]	and something about her got my pulse revved . " what 's behind that door , baby ? " she said . her words sounded flat like she was trying to hide whatever it was that was bothering her
[198/1000]	" how ? " " by leaving him there completely open to attack . i 'll bet he 'd like to fight , too . " he laughed . " this will have to be your plan . "
[199/1000]	i stared at the empty seat in front of me before pushing forward , searching for any kind of reaction from dex , but all i saw was a vacant wall . i pushed my way through the crowd and
[200/1000]	" tell him , " i added . " tell him i spoke to him . " " you 're the boss . " " is he paying for things of value we should n't be buying ?
[201/1000]	he could n't believe he 'd let them find him standing next to the truck . he was a damn fool . he should have kept <EOS> ... he was supposed to have taken care of that right away ,
[202/1000]	" i think that if i told you how much i want to have sex with you , you 'd run away . " he was getting angry with me now , i realized . " how could you
[203/1000]	' and i can see why you 'd choose to go along , ' said the head . ' why not ? ' she hesitated . ' well , perhaps i expected ... you know ... '
[204/1000]	" the hell i do n't , " she said indignantly . " hey , it 's my job . if you 've forgotten , i 'm totally not your type . " his humor warmed her a
[205/1000]	" it wo n't help , " said my father . " the word of a mad poet is a thing of the past again . " " and there will be too many people here to take their
[206/1000]	" i do n't have a plan , " i tell paul . " just because i do n't know what you can do does n't mean i do n't . you 're smarter than most of us ,
[207/1000]	she tried to figure out how she was going to get through the night , how to recover from the pain that she 'd experienced . she did n't know how to go back to school without telling her parents
[208/1000]	" he is not a person , only a weapon . " his dark eyes flash , " and you are not a weapon , but a thing that knows death , is how you see things . i
[209/1000]	or maybe i have something to do with that ? " " was it a fight ? " i nodded . " it was a big fight . there was some kind of code , but i got
[210/1000]	" in our business there are occasional attacks . the government has plenty . this wo n't continue , " said one man . " it wo n't continue if we do n't get our money 's worth ,
[211/1000]	" yes , ma'am . " there was a small , shy smile in his gaze . " do n't put it off too long , young man . i really think you are the one . "
[212/1000]	" you do n't want to talk . " she said . " not here . someone please come get me ! " i whispered . i knew it would all make me look crazy - but then again
[213/1000]	" but we can tell them nothing of how to approach it . " " and find the truth ? " " how could we ever use that against them in that ? " " the question
[214/1000]	" sure , " he answered , wondering if she and charlie had tried to save the cookies . " i promise , " she replied , sounding pleased . " and they were great . thanks . "
[215/1000]	" that 's right , " said the girl . " no one can prove it . " " but they do it all the time in the movies , " said the woman . " when the camera
[216/1000]	she did n't like it . why was it all he took for granted ? except that he was such a damn good father that somehow he was actually better than that , she tried not to think about it
[217/1000]	" you got one of those small cameras , " he said . " maybe you can send information to our contact . " " what if you do n't trust me ? " " i do .
[218/1000]	it was very early and while a quarter mile of empty , dark fields spread out before her , a short distance from the road , she saw a barn . she pulled her jeep into the clearing and parked
[219/1000]	" it was wonderful to meet you , mom , " she said to the table after she got back from the loo . " i wish i could have been there for the funeral , but you were
[220/1000]	" yeah , where are we ? " " i do n't know . just off the highway . " he looked around and nodded . " here we are . " i looked around too , but
[221/1000]	" why does everyone do that ? " i asked . " get so mad at me for failing ? " " if you must know , " aunt b said , " i suppose it 's considered a
[222/1000]	i 'm sorry , your grace . lady sybil came up next to sybil with the tray . " you did that on purpose . " " no . " sybil smiled . if anyone expected mary to
[223/1000]	" what is it ? " he said , watching the man warily . " something that upset you ? " the man turned to face the boy . at first , he did n't like either of them
[224/1000]	he smiled , but there was a tightness in his gaze . all he said was " i need to know . " i was n't sure what it meant but i knew it was an insult . i
[225/1000]	i held his face again . " then why , jude ? " " why ? " he repeated . this time , he sounded so disgusted with himself that i stopped . why do you stop talking ,
[226/1000]	she rubbed her cheek against my chest once more . i kissed the top of her head . i finally said , " i love you , baby . " * * * the morning of the
[227/1000]	it was dark before i made it to my apartment door . when i opened it , a group of men stood around in a cluster outside my apartment door . i stood there in the house on three ,
[228/1000]	he could tell he was n't going to get any less pleasure out of it . that much he was certain of . " you already know everything , huh ? " " i know . and not
[229/1000]	" and by " i 'm really not interested in the reason for your call , " i mean one last thing - what do you want for christmas ? i do n't know about any christmas , too .
[230/1000]	another one of the many times i 've heard that sound coming from her mouth , when she 's moaning in need , when i 've learned what she wants , when she needs . it 's the sweetest
[231/1000]	" right . " his voice was a little rough , too . " i should still have told you not to go after her . " that one was more than a little insulting . " you think

[233/1000]	you 'd think one of them like as crazy as you had enough problems without adding to them , by the way . even if , by some miracle , i could bring myself to talk to one again ,
[234/1000]	the woman got up and came over by the table to help bring the drinks over to them . the man moved out of the room briefly and returned with a couple of drinks for mr. wilson , some red
[235/1000]	" never mind , do n't expect me to go running to a priest next time , " she responded with a laugh , " but you wo n't have to worry about me for a while . "
[236/1000]	" we got the key today . said you were a party favor . " a second later , a black limousine pulled up outside . the driver opened the back doors to give the two young men a
[237/1000]	" shit . i 'm sorry . who were you talking to ? " " the man who picked up the phone at the number in his phone , mr. remons . you said you saw him driving by
[238/1000]	i blinked . " oh yeah , " he whispered . " what have i missed ? " i asked . " you . <EOS> my girl . " i pushed up and over him ,
[239/1000]	she had been listening to radio chatter about an oil consortium that owned a group called silver river mining . there was a report a reporter had reported . " they say there 's a rumor about a group of
[240/1000]	" sure , why not ? you wo n't need us , " i said , " we 're in here together . " i started laughing , " we 'll be sharing this one . remember , it 's
[241/1000]	chapter eleven when they arrived at the cemetery , the headstones were quiet and grave - like . the flowers were too pink , the roses too delicate . the grass was covered in snow , not in a
[242/1000]	" what do you need ? " he hesitated . " i need the book . i need your help . " " what book ? " " the one the angels gave us to put in
[243/1000]	he pointed to the ceiling . " that was my thought . can you imagine ? " she followed the arc of his finger . " see , that 's the light . " he knelt and pointed
[244/1000]	" yes . i think he was a teacher . " " i do remember him . he was a bit older than i. " " well , i like his work , " she said with a
[245/1000]	" no . " " good answer . " the king let out a breath . " you look like you got a little too much sun , " ryan remarked as he led her to sit at
[246/1000]	i pulled out my phone and saw i had half a dozen missed calls . after texting my mom to see if i could get her to call me back as soon as she could , i hung up
[247/1000]	i stood still , trembling , waiting until his fingers closed around my bare breasts . he cupped them , pinched them , massaged them . i cried out , unable to stop . i wanted him to take
[248/1000]	he did n't know in which direction the wolf had been taken and he did n't want to know , it just had it 's teeth in his belly and it had been there for him for his whole life
[249/1000]	her heart swelled and a small smile lifted the corners of her lips . but when her gaze slid in the direction of the door to find what was with the strange look on his face , she was unable
[250/1000]	" my friend , please , " ian prompted gently . " i 've lost everything ; how can i keep another person i love ? the child ! " he watched the woman who could destroy everything
[251/1000]	" why ? who the hell are you ? " the man demanded . " i 'm a friend of mr. mercer . " she glanced at alex again . " i guess i should be calling you alex
[252/1000]	it seemed the guy 's mind just was n't functioning right . maybe that was why he did n't have his power . okay , then , with that " gift " he found her . he 'd tried
[253/1000]	" i 'm going to shower , " i said . my brain was still reeling with shock . " you guys have fun . " they nodded in agreement , but i could n't take them in my

[255/1000]	the red sky had receded as well , and a few stars did show through . jack 's expression on that last one was unreadable as he gazed up at the darkened sky . silence stretched between them while they
[256/1000]	he opened his mouth to reply , but something inside him sensed that he should not let go of the memories . as when they were younger , he had seen another man sitting with a woman , young and
[257/1000]	he shook his head and looked over . " no . i do n't think so . " " he knows . he saw the change in her when he saw her . did n't take a chance on
[258/1000]	" yes , my lady . " she turned to glare at him . " sorry . you 'll have to earn my respect . do you think you can remember me long enough to do that ?
[259/1000]	" it is not something you forget . i will see to it that his remains are moved to a place of water and he will remain there until his soul leaves this place . " she put all her
[260/1000]	" ah yes , she 's the most beautiful woman i 've ever seen , " he said as he stood and approached me with obvious pride in his eyes . " she 's going to have your children .
[261/1000]	" we 'll talk about that later , " i tell his sister . " i 'm so glad you 're here . " she lets out a long sigh , putting her arm around him . "

[263/1000]	" they already sent you an updated copy . " " they were going to , but , then , it just did n't happen . " she placed a hand over mine on the desk . "
[264/1000]	" that 's what has me worried , " said granny . " i think we 've lost a major city . " " really ? " said magrat . " but we 've just got to get there
[265/1000]	" so , what do you think of them ? " i opened my eyes at the reference to my ex - husband and leaned against my headboard . he was so f * * king handsome . even

[268/1000]	" he wo n't want a repeat of last night . " " that does n't matter , " i say , looking away from him when he looks at me like i 'm crazy . " it
[269/1000]	she seemed flustered , and her gaze followed the floor as she talked . " what can i do ? you 're upset . " " no , they 're fine . you 're happy . remember you
[270/1000]	she was about to tell him the truth when his lips covered hers . it was like electricity arced between them , electricity that sparked and danced inside her . he tasted like a combination of rain and whisky .
[271/1000]	" i think he has a point , " said clarence . " although i agree entirely with the man . " " what 's that , old chap ? " asked haddington dryly . " he 's
[272/1000]	" of course , " he said slowly . to you , he added silently . " and i am taking the chance that it comes from you , not my mother . " he was silent for
[273/1000]	" where was i ? " she answered . " oh yes , i remember , yes , it was very bright , very bright and very hard to get down the stairs . we arrived and discovered we were

[275/1000]	" there was nothing . " " oh , then they are being careless , are they not ? they 're letting all our men die without any concern for his well - being , in fact . "
[276/1000]	" and ... ? " i asked , hoping the way she still looked at me was n't giving me a bad feeling . " and i think ... i think you 're pretty , too , " she
[277/1000]	" in this case , mr. bishop , he has n't already . " bishop stared at her for a moment into eyes that were much like hers , only as colorless - looking . " i need
[278/1000]	his eyes lit up as he saw her . " i get a kick out of that . you 're the only one who had a crush on him that you would n't betray your friend . " she
[279/1000]	" it would be better to say you do not know our circumstances , though i wonder if you have much experience with love . " " i ca n't say that i have ever had any romantic interest
[280/1000]	" just a look - could he be ... ? " she stopped to stare at the bodies , then turned back and shook her head . " no , but do he have fangs , or - ?
[281/1000]	jack ran down the path with his bare feet slapping the wet earth , stopping to rest regularly as he traversed with a little bird in his arms <EOS> or walked past those who strolled alone and to the village
[282/1000]	" so you 're saying we come equipped with explosives ? and that means what ? we should just go in there and ask him if he wants to try ? " i asked sarcastically . " seriously ,
[283/1000]	i nod . i knew she was going to get it . " you make it sound like a fairy tale rather than a reality . " " it is n't a fairy tale , " i refute
[284/1000]	" so what are you , a spy ? " " i do n't look like one to you ? " " sorry , are you a pirate captain now ? " " i do n't know
[285/1000]	" maybe not a big deal of the flesh - giving variety and because of that kind of thing that 's good to have for a daughter , but i 'll tell you one thing , it can always change
[286/1000]	the other men began throwing a couple of sticks into the fire . this was much more efficient , if not more quickly . with a big wooden club and axe gripped firmly in both hands , the two warriors
[287/1000]	then he caught my hand , pulled me to our table , his thumb sweeping across my pulse point as i stepped back . he slid an arm under my back and guided my chair into mine .
[288/1000]	" i 'm sorry ... i mean ... " she broke down in huge , crying sobs . i hugged her tightly back . " i was so sure you loved me , " i said , trying to
[289/1000]	we set out walking as the sun emerged just past a horizon that was a brilliant orange . it had been two weeks since the vampire . it had been the most amazing place i 'd ever been .
[290/1000]	" i 'm guessing that , by what you said last night , ms. smith is your number one fan ? " she nodded vigorously , smiling softly . apparently , not . " i take it that
[291/1000]	" well , right now , you 'll just have to find someone else to help you , " i snap at him . he 's not happy , i can tell . he tries , but he ca

[294/1000]	" well , " i say finally . " my dad and i used to come over when he drove us to portland back in the day . we 'd eat on the sand every saturday . " for
[295/1000]	the way she told it was in the past . i 've learned to accept it , even though in my line of work it was a personal struggle . i 've come to accept that if you have to
[296/1000]	' i think you could help us with that , ' he added after a moment , when the thought of trying something had occurred to him . ' we would be quite proud of the way i 've been

[299/1000]	that evening they waited anxiously : a little nervous , a little apprehensive that their courage might fail them , as the sun would not rise . the worst of the gloom fell like a curtain . but in

[301/1000]	" so , you never said ? " " never . " there was a pause , like she was reading his mind - either that or he had made a dumb mistake and was wondering if he
[302/1000]	" i 'm going to give you time to adjust - " " i wo n't , " she gasped . " all right , yes , you will . but i 'll be here if you need
[303/1000]	" not right now , no . what about tomorrow ? right , you know the day after tomorrow , right ? " " right . i ... see . " she nodded . " i 'm going to
[304/1000]	she did n't move . she just glared at me . she was still pissed . " fine . as long as you 're ready by five . " i did n't apologize or apologize and i knew
[305/1000]	" why did you drag me tonight ? " i asked him . " but , this is what i 've been waiting for and i 've got a nice song planned that involves you singing your sweet and
[306/1000]	the guard with the glasses gave her the night pass . " you 're supposed to be the guest of honor . this is a private room . go ahead and get in there . if we leave , you
[307/1000]	an invisible guard lifted his rifle and aimed directly at me . for a second , his eyes flickered from amber to blue , and his stance tensed up . then the guard relaxed his rifle . his right hand
[308/1000]	" is that the reason you were home earlier ? " he nods . " just to get an early start and work . " he 's good . i glance around my new bedroom . i
[309/1000]	" you 're kidding me ? what in the hell ? " " i wanted to do it , but i could n't . he insisted , but i did n't think it would work , knowing what you
[310/1000]	" not exactly . you have n't decided whether you want to live or die . " " no ? " he made an odd sound in his throat . " but i ca n't have a mother .
[311/1000]	" you did n't think i 'd follow you the other night , did you ? " " no , of course not . i was getting my ass kicked by guys from the other school . " i
[312/1000]	" go , " i say to the boy . " tell the mayor he wo n't come back . " the boy nods , the word leaving him without much conviction . " i will hold you
[313/1000]	" i 'm tired , " she agreed , settling down to lie next to danny again , " but i do n't want to stay in that cave any more . " danny glanced toward the kitchen ,
[314/1000]	i shook my head , keeping my focus on the woman beside me . " i saw them , " i reminded her . " we know . " " they moved , " i said , and
[315/1000]	" ah ! " she cried , her hand flying to her mouth as her eyes widened and her heart started to pound madly . with a grimace of disgust , he turned his anger on the man behind
[316/1000]	" so what are you supposed to do when you catch her ? i will give you one straight answer . you need to stop being a coward . i had a life before you . i am able to
[317/1000]	" what 's a matter , my lady ? are you sure of all the details ? " his voice rose with the concern for her . " i 'm sure . i am the one being threatened by
[318/1000]	" i was afraid of it , " he said . " of the unknown ? " " of you . you do n't know what 's behind the door . i 'll keep it locked , of
[319/1000]	" well , my mother did n't get the full power . but she did get enough . " a couple hours later , the guys rolled in the big green convertible the driver had hired to take them
[320/1000]	" yes , yes . of course . " i wanted to laugh ; he was acting very paranoid like some movie star . i might know some people who were on the right track at getting into the
[321/1000]	" it was never finished , mr. preston . and you have quite a bit left to work out . there is other stuff to be done before i can do what i came here to do , but as
[322/1000]	i was n't sure how fast it had gone , but after it went for a couple minutes , the sky flickered blue , and it started to rain . i glanced underneath the car as if checking it was
[323/1000]	" oh no you do n't , " he said , turning her up on her toes and kissing her lips at the same time . she pulled back to stare up at him . " what are you
[324/1000]	i pulled myself back , putting as much distance between us as possible . you do n't need to hit my ass with a pillow to get me to leave . the conversation did n't go far . i
[325/1000]	" your husband . will you be staying with him for the next few months ? " " you mean i have n't made the decision about whether , after i was murdered last month , and i can
[326/1000]	" that you are the best this side of the mississippi ! " she said in a loud voice . " yeah . that i am , " he said . " why are you so quiet ?
[327/1000]	" you 're an expert at this ? " she could n't believe he was actually afraid to touch her . he sighed dreamily . " god , you 're beautiful , " he whispered . she was
[328/1000]	" are you all right ? " she nodded . " then why are n't you more upset ? " there was something frightening - a fierce certainty - in his voice , and a dark panic
[329/1000]	the older men had given their compliments . the more the men enjoyed , the more i enjoyed <EOS> sure the more later my first love and the more i enjoyed the play , just until i stopped listening to
[330/1000]	" what do you think ? " " it 's beautiful , " susan said , staring out the window . " yes , it is . but there is something else . " " what ,
[331/1000]	the next forty minu ses , the next two and a half , were the highest of all her many other assignments , including her classes at the community college , or in the cafeteria . she enjoyed writing to
[332/1000]	" yes , i did , " she said . he raised his hand , and the room cleared . " my lady ? " lord gareth was , as lucien had guessed , standing by himself , his
[333/1000]	' this will all seem really absurd once i explain everything , ' stragen countered . ' it may even take a dozen people to explain to me why i might have had an interest in the course of my
[334/1000]	mr. stone leaned forward and took my hand in his and squeezed it . " let 's not mention that again . now , let 's get to work on this . " we spent the rest of the
[335/1000]	the question stopped me in my tracks , but it was answered when the boy next to us stopped too . i watched the boy 's face , not recognizing him . were they twins ? had i ever seen
[336/1000]	" do n't worry . i 'll see you just before school starts and i 'll walk with you as you head home . " a tear slipped from my eye and i wiped it away . " thanks
[337/1000]	" thank you , " she said sincerely . " but do n't rush the process . we just do n't have a lot to go on . i 'm still looking for a family and i think we have
[338/1000]	" just to let you know , i was thinking about going see the doctor today and showing it to him . " " what would that accomplish ? " he said as he returned from his break .
[339/1000]	we all laughed . it took me a long time to stop smiling , but in a strange way my sorrow was soothed . i was n't disappointed at the little kid , jason , who was so much
[340/1000]	" not hardly . " he grinned at her . " now , let 's go take a look at what 's been coming up on us . " " your room key ? " lindy asked incredulously ,
[341/1000]	" do n't worry , he thinks they 're in her house . i 've asked her to wait for me on the porch . " " can you get her up there ? " i nodded .
[342/1000]	" oh . . . i forgot , " she lied . she was busy wiping tears from her eyes with her forearms . he would see that , she knew , she knew . " so that was
[343/1000]	they watched in grim silence as the boat 's propeller died out . one by one , they turned their heads to look at the floating body , a blue - haired boy whose mouth was ripped open and his
[344/1000]	" it was the man myself , " he said . " that 's what we do now . all of us . we do n't try to escape . we kill . it 's simple stuff , actually .
[345/1000]	" that was a long time ago . i just never got back together . i kind of miss that time , but i just ca n't feel the way you feel about me . i could n't be without
[346/1000]	" well , he 's on a boat . " " can you tell that he left from the dock ? " anne asked . " no , but the only logical explanation is that he must be
[347/1000]	" the boy was too new ? " not that i had a choice . " maybe , " i whispered . " what made you do it ? " " because it had power , "
[348/1000]	" my father was a warrior and a man like your father . he once served the night with ar gy ll . he was a great warrior until he lost his leg . he lost the kingdom of light
[349/1000]	he lifted his head , but he was shaking his head . " i think i would have died otherwise . at least " - he looked around the empty room . " where 's my laptop ? "
[350/1000]	" please , i do n't know you , but i 'm really sorry . when you were saying that you did n't really love me , something about your expression turned sour . i think my mother and i
[351/1000]	he pulled her head back so the full force of his gaze met hers . " i 'm not going anywhere , " he said solemnly . she sucked in her breath in surprise at the fierceness she
[352/1000]	i heard the front door open . it was weird watching him move through the house too , like he knew the place , but still ... he stayed at the window or the doorway every day , watching the
[353/1000]	and right now , we did n't need to play the role of those two little monsters . like i said , ethan was in charge . he 'd put out a call , let them know we were here
[354/1000]	" a day after the funeral ? " ethan asked . i was n't sure if he was remembering the part where i said i wanted a week in vegas permanently until he could find a place for me at
[355/1000]	" not until i get back , " he said , and then he was gone , running and dodging the cars that squealed as he left . i was still standing there dumbfounded when i finally walked inside
[356/1000]	" and that 's where the battle is going to start , " his grandmother says before turning to look back at me . " what battle ? what war ? " i ask , but before i can
[357/1000]	" no , son . " " why did you have to quit ? " " i had other things to do on an empty stomach . " they both laughed , but neither wanted to deal with
[358/1000]	" well it 's at high noon , but it seems i 'm the only one who does n't . " " ah , " he says . " you told me it was out there , "
[359/1000]	" all right , everybody , " he said . " there 's nothing left to say right now . " " which one of you is going to explain it to me ? " " because we
[360/1000]	jason looked down and said , ' look , give that to me . ' ' hold that water , you fool , ' she said . it was a mistake . when they approached the water
[361/1000]	you ca n't expect me to believe all this . " his dark eyebrows went up . " you think it has anything to do with rachel ? " " not that i can think of . if
[362/1000]	" you know , i just would have loved to see ... " " ... who was writing , sir ? " the officer placed a cup to jon 's lips and then he placed the cup down .
[363/1000]	my mother 's reaction to seeing what a werewolf was , the tone and tone of her voice made me think she did n't necessarily approve . " wait a minute , " i broke in . " you
[364/1000]	he took a step toward me , and i flinched , but my back was to him . he reached out with one hand and wiped the hair that had fallen into my face . " you 've learned
[365/1000]	my hands move as i pull with all my might to un snap the other three buttons on her blouse . she stumbles at the sudden abrupt change in position , and i ease up on the motion so that
[366/1000]	" how ? they might have sensed it . " " they might have , " said millard . " but if we find another way now , they wo n't , either . " " and if
[367/1000]	oh , lord . i 've just had a threesome . in my home . what am i going to do now ? the door to the parlor opened and a woman came in , looking as if she
[368/1000]	" hey , " she said just as he opened the door . he stopped in his tracks . " what 's wrong ? " she asked him . " i ca n't sleep , " he
[369/1000]	" i know . i ca n't stay , " he says . " it 's only been a day . and why would you be doing that after your mother died ? " " i ca n't
[370/1000]	that night when jim finished his last three beers , he collapsed in bed and did n't move for a while . it looked like he had n't eaten in two days . <EOS> sure a little , but he
[371/1000]	there was nothing they could do about it now . " can we bring him out of his room to a meeting ? " " i guess so , " eve said . of course . she glanced at
[372/1000]	" thank you , " she said , taking it . " i loved you to the moon and back , you know . " she laid her hand on his face . she 'd wanted to kiss him
[373/1000]	we got a ride from the hotel , and i got the room key . the men did n't say much . they seemed embarrassed about something . this really irritated me . what did they care if i was
[374/1000]	" are n't you supposed to be on the other side ? " he shook his head . " i 'm so not on the other side . " she frowned and glanced around them . " in
[375/1000]	instead she smiled and opened her arms for a hug , his face hard . she knew then that he blamed himself for not reaching out soon . but she wanted to be there for him , knew that he
[376/1000]	she did not look up from the table as she answered . " it 's in the closet . " " i will check the kitchen , " i said and walked out of her office and down the
[377/1000]	" i know . okay , let 's go . " i follow him into my room and open the closet . he takes out a black suit and ties . i 'm not buying him a suit to
[378/1000]	he moved into a far corner , though not from the crowd nor the stage . i caught a glimpse of his face , and saw only his eyes . i backed out of sight around the corner .
[379/1000]	it was already dark as a shadow when i got there , but there was no reason for me to turn on the street lights . the sky was almost completely dark when i stepped over the wire fence ,
[380/1000]	she shook her head . " i ca n't let you get injured . " " and i do n't understand why ? " he gave her a strange look . " you 've read my file . tell
[381/1000]	" we need to get it at least one night , " i announced when we were almost there . " i never promised anything to either of us . " " you said it was n't a
[382/1000]	" what all were you expecting me to , to take control ? " " for all of us to get together and go after that man on that boat . " " and we thought it was
[383/1000]	" sure . " was it necessary for a college professor to be so full of himself ? this was the second time he 'd walked into an old , decrepit office building and not taken one glance around
[384/1000]	the only reason i had any more sense than you is because i do n't want you to see me again . " " but why not ? " " i want this . " " to
[385/1000]	he smiled . " i did n't mean that . " " no , there is something that i do n't think i can handle . i 'm scared that - " " i 've never heard .
[386/1000]	and then it stopped . he heard the hiss of air escaping from the window and the sharp intake of her ragged breaths . he heard her take a breath of her own . felt her tremble near his
[387/1000]	1 pu tter 1 rolled 1 made 1 crawled 1 shit 1 dark 1 looked 1 five 1 hit 1 opened 1 un anticipated 1 man 's 1
[388/1000]	" i could n't tell you her address . i just know that whoever is in charge , will be there . if not , i 'll deal with it . " " what do i tell her about
[389/1000]	" there are no cameras , " reacher said . he was half - way through the sentence . " no cameras , " she repeated . " but it really would be helpful if you went that direction
[390/1000]	' it 's ok . you do n't have to run , of course . ' ' thanks , i know the feeling . you certainly do n't look too good . ' ' i 'm fine .
[391/1000]	" i want to go now , please follow me . " daniel turned and they disappeared somewhere on the train ride back to london . it was early evening in the west end , with no sign of
[392/1000]	" you have a lot to learn , " she teased , handing him a cup , which he held out before taking it from her . they sat on the floor and drank . she started in on the
[393/1000]	" there 's got to be something you can do for him . " i sat up and took a couple of deep breaths , trying to regain control of my anger . i just wanted to kill the
[394/1000]	" i wanted to share how lucky i get , but his dad was there , and he was scared shitless . he knew i was going to blow it . he was worried when he said i 'd blow
[395/1000]	" he 's here ? " " we know he is . " i knew it was true . had i not known that ? i did n't leave the room for a long time , as she
[396/1000]	" i 'm good at what i do , ms. morgan , but i do n't just live for the hunt . that 's all i am . " she shook her head . " if i wanted
[397/1000]	" well , i hope it has been a good lesson for you , " i said . i did n't hear a thing that was said next , but i knew i heard the sound of voices and that
[398/1000]	" you got yourself a hot date tonight ? " i frowned . " why ? because i 've got a date with a little less than twenty - four hours to get that dress ? " "
[399/1000]	the man who had been driving seemed to comprehend . it had had to have been very stressful , because any moment he would have let his left hand drop from the wheel to his lap and he would have
[400/1000]	" sorry , " i said , a little bit miffed . " that 's okay , " said <EOS> over , and then i could work on her . " you do n't have anything . i 'm
[401/1000]	for now , she had to pay for keeping her mouth shut in spite of max 's threatening texts and the other guests . the rest of her life , she would be a part of this family .
[402/1000]	" is it a good thing ? " " you mean why is it an integral part of the mission ? " " not necessarily . " " so , i 'll try and play a better
[403/1000]	they decided to go for a swim first . " hey , " nate said to the others . " can <EOS> " you make you jealous " was supposed to be something between the word is and "
[404/1000]	oh , yeah . he was now . he did n't want her here and not on his turf . " go . " she ran across the floor , leaving him to do what he had to do
[405/1000]	for the first time that morning her throat began to close until no sound came . " why were you working at pe ach tree ? " " i just liked those files . what about you ? "
[406/1000]	" how long have you been a vampire ? " she asked . " for a couple hundred years . " " did n't take me long to learn anything . " she smiled briefly then asked ,
[407/1000]	" what are you doing ? " " look , mike , i 'll be back in a minute and we 'll watch the old show again . " she did n't look like she was going to leave
[408/1000]	" you ca n't be serious ! " i 'm so amazed at what 's happening to me , at how it seems , in the way i 'm acting . i expect my clothes to magically fade in about
[409/1000]	you can pick your battles , girl . you may be too naive to know that , but some day , you will understand the folly of your actions . come with me . " she did . if
[410/1000]	her eyes flashed and the whites of them became sharp points . " do n't pull shit like this , " she snapped . " we 've been through too much to make this easy . hell , he
[411/1000]	she went outside and sat down on the porch , facing the lake . a breeze moved the loose leaves that drifted along the walkway . sunlight glinted off the surface of the water . the water was so clear
[412/1000]	a chill rose up my spine once more , as he walked toward me , his gaze a hot challenge in his navy trousers and dark gray shirt . " come on , " he said , taking my
[413/1000]	" that 's enough . tell them to wait while he gathers his things . i 'll ask if they want a ride . " " no , it 's too late for that . the storm is here
[414/1000]	" okay , " he sighed . " you never will be . " <EOS> before she ate . if she knew for hours . but it sounded like a thousand rabbits . " hey , " i
[415/1000]	" hello ? hello ? ... mrs. clark ? are you still there ? ... okay . do you want a cup of coffee with me ? ... i 've just had a late call ... ok , i will
[416/1000]	" yeah , all okay . do n't worry , i 'll wait for you , though . " " thanks . bye , sweetie . " i clicked off and turned the phone off . something seemed to
[417/1000]	" i thought you said that men just stood to gain . " " women seem to enjoy being in charge of their dicks regardless of the matter . " jack grinned . " but i do n't think
[418/1000]	" do n't forget your sister , " the brunette said , her voice dripping sarcasm . " if this becomes public knowledge , your name comes up . " " i do n't care . " "
[419/1000]	" no . i 'm telling you this because i do n't want her to die , " said andrew , keeping his distance from the girl he loved so much . " why ? why do n't you
[420/1000]	as she continued to stare at that stupid laptop , the words that had been carved in the hard wood replayed again and again in her mind . " i wo n't let you go , sophie , "
[421/1000]	" you had to get the blood to cure her ? " the sheriff gasped out . " she needed her own blood . " sarah stared at him hard . " no , i did n't .
[422/1000]	" or why do n't you - " she threw the towel at him before going to her room . " what the holy hell ? " matt almost yelled , as he went after her . she was
[423/1000]	" you were always jealous of him . " " yes , i was . he had such a good sense of humor . " i pause . " not to mention very interested when we first met .
[424/1000]	she did n't know what to say to him . " where are you staying ? " she asked instead . " come on , baby . we can call it a night . " " no ,
[425/1000]	" i think you have a good mind to leave me here as a temporary resident until either we make a decision that i ca n't leave . i may leave for good , maybe not for good , but
[426/1000]	" i have no fear of him . " " look what he 's gotten himself into now . why are you just waiting for me to die - and for your damned plan to work ? "
[427/1000]	then the man got up and they talked for several minutes until they were finally alone in the hallway . " you 're pretty stupid , " jackson said . " there was at least five of us .
[428/1000]	" we 'd like one of those bottled beers with lemon and lime over ice . " a tiny snort of amusement escaped from me . i knew sam was n't in touch with his alcohol ban . a
[429/1000]	" thank you . " and then a thought occurred to her . " do you know of someone who might be persuaded to give you a few more days with mr. wil lough by ? " the lady
[430/1000]	a large dark shape appeared out of the darkness with a long , deadly slash slashing across the black mass . instantly , the form went through the air , somersa ulting down toward the dark figure with great accuracy
[431/1000]	' maybe he 's not so sure , ' said the bartender . ' we have a lot to talk about , mr lipwig , ' said vetinari , as if the prospect of more than words was as exciting
[432/1000]	they stared at each other for a while and then began to talk in hushed tones . " right now , only you can know , " she said , " all we can do is wait and see
[433/1000]	" i saw you in a vision , " she said . " what are you doing right now ? " " uh . " " well , " she pushed him back on the table , "
[434/1000]	" who ? " " the god of the mountains . " " lord odin ? " she replied hesitantly . " yes , he is a god . they are more than just the gods ,
[435/1000]	he sighed and slid his phone back below the pillow . " her ... who is she ? " he asked through the door . the only person he even knew who could be her was the only thing
[436/1000]	the question fell from her lips like a stone , and when he finally answered that very question with conviction , it shocked her - it was a question about her and what they 'd been , together .
[437/1000]	" we are . " her voice was stern , reminding him of the way she got at other doms . she was making him think he should n't be giving in . there were no rules , no rules
[438/1000]	my eyes go wide . " did you really just say - " " yes ! " he shouts , a wild gleam in his gray eyes . " stop talking ? " " yes ! how
[439/1000]	" i hate hearing you say that ! but i 'll never make that mistake again . " " you can die , babe . but not . you 're mine , you 'll always be mine . nothing
[440/1000]	" now , i 'm telling you what i 've told you , missy . a man who knows my past , he does n't tell others . he does n't play games . a man who 's looking for
[441/1000]	" why me ? why do you have all the stuff ? " " because the last one you bought me was n't exactly what i had in mind when i bought my room . " he shook
[442/1000]	it was n't a lie . and it was n't from him . from god , why did he say it all the time ? what did he think of her after he 'd seen the photographs of her ?
[443/1000]	" ah ha ! " the voice whispered . " there 's the little one . " " silence , it seemed . " i wonder why i 'm not dead ? " the voice mused .
[444/1000]	" oh no , " she mumbled , scooting away , " i was just going away for a week , i think , " was all she managed to say . matt was disappointed , " okay ,
[445/1000]	" and because one of us does , " said vimes . " at least that 's what i think . " the head of the patrician 's staff nodded gravely . then he said , " have you
[446/1000]	" get back into the car ! get back in the car ! " robert shouted . he pointed to the door . " get in the damn car ! leave that mess here alone ! " robert was already
[447/1000]	" if i have to , i 'll kill anybody who 's been hurt . " " good . because you 're going to kill me . i ca n't watch somebody be hurt . " " you
[448/1000]	" fuck , " he managed to say through his clenched teeth . for him , such a gesture always meant a bad thing . " jesus christ , mary and joseph . " chase fell behind the women
[449/1000]	" you 're right . there had to be a reason . that and the fact that you 're such an incredible listener . " in the far corner of the bedroom , i heard a faint clinking of
[450/1000]	' and do n't worry , ' he said , ' these guys just told their guys to keep 'em looking and give 'em a minute . i do n't know how you 'll be able to do that -
[451/1000]	" you told him you did n't want to be married ? " she asked . " in the end , it was on my terms , actually . " " but why ? " he shrugged
[452/1000]	after we 've had breakfast and the dishes are done , we head for the office . the room is dark and empty but for a single light that is blinking on the bedside table . a faint smell of
[453/1000]	we turned down an alley that led to a crumbling brick warehouse opposite and headed down a few steps . " what do you say you and i get our rest and get what we came for ? "
[454/1000]	i was just starting to like him . i had enjoyed spending christmas with him , but the fun was suddenly over , and i was ready to call it a night . i returned to my stateroom as
[455/1000]	" they , um ... they are <EOS> ( and i 'm more into my husband and a friend , where there should be no such thing as divorce ) . " she put her fist to her mouth ,
[456/1000]	" okay . i 'll get a job tomorrow . " i sat there for a moment , taking everything in . " you really wanted to go to a funeral , did n't you ? " she
[457/1000]	" well , yeah , i guess it 's easy to lose track of time sometimes , but we do n't have to go back yet . we could live off my savings for a while - i can get
[458/1000]	" not even for a moment . " i pull on a pair of briefs , and he nods his head , no questions asked . " so what do you think ? " i ask him , running
[459/1000]	' this is my man , ' said bill . ' we got him for a job . ' ' you do n't have to be quite so quick to do anything . ' ' he 's got
[460/1000]	" here again ? come on , are you joking ? " " no . tell me you would have sent me away . " " if i wanted to stop you from trying to kill me i
[461/1000]	he did n't say anything , did n't look away . the woman was an adult , and if he ever wanted to be an adult , he 'd have to go get the hell out of there , and
[462/1000]	" i told you he lives in the area . he is very good . and so he stayed for the fall over . " " my father died and my son was forced to make himself scarce .
[463/1000]	the king said nothing . he was not accustomed to failure . " i only know one thing , " the king said . " she is dead , and the white blade is coming to her aid .
[464/1000]	" have you met my best friend before ? no ? tell me about her . " * " so . " claire turned to face me . " i 'm assuming you 're back to looking a
[465/1000]	though there was something intimate in the situation , there was also understanding and encouragement . his thoughts were now directed at another man . he knew everything about her now . knew how to kiss a woman the
[466/1000]	all they could do now was keep looking and hope . but how long would it be before they were found ? and how far would they be forced to go till they reached their destination ? a
[467/1000]	" thanks , i think . the answer is yes i suppose . i was thinking rather hard about the story you told me , the one involving your ... your mother 's death and when it happened . i
[468/1000]	" i suppose , " said seldon , " but i 'm wondering if the galaxy really is that great . " raych shook his head . " no . it 's got little . there are great areas
[469/1000]	" i did n't expect anyone to be calling in this late at night , " hunter said , walking deeper into the large kitchen . his father 's office was quiet , save for the sound of the television
[470/1000]	" tell them i want to see him . tell them just leave . " " you get your hand out , " max said , pointing at my purse . he moved behind the desk . "
[471/1000]	" so he 's not mad ? " she said softly . " no , and that 's good . he 's getting on with his life . " she let out a long breath . " that
[472/1000]	i pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed jessica . " hello ? " " riley ? " " yes ? " " hi , jess . " " hi , is there a
[473/1000]	maybe she 'd do the same thing to him . probably not . but she did n't have much choice until she stopped being attracted to him . " i 'd like to know where that would lead . "
[474/1000]	" i know , " richard said . " but my friends have to be prepared . " he looked longingly at the open door . " not that i 'm complaining . how about that coffee ? "
[475/1000]	i 'm glad for that . " i will come for you tonight , " i say , reaching out to caress his cheek . but he shakes his head , his eyes so intense . " i
[476/1000]	" ah . " he stared at the photograph , then back at the photo , an odd - looking young man with the same hair and eyes . " i recognize him . " " i see ...
[477/1000]	' you 're lucky i have n't given the law a run for its money , ' she snapped . ' i already gave the law ry makers another run for their money and every now and then it
[478/1000]	i give him a playful swat . " i ca n't really think of really much better ways to talk to you , " he answers with a lopsided grin through his pain . " you 've clearly been
[479/1000]	" i 'm just asking because you look like you 'd fit right in there , especially when you drink so much . " she laughed and moved away from him to set up a makeshift tray on the

[481/1000]	the nurse sighed as she released me and let me back away from her . " my dear , you are suffering at the hands of a monster , and i am a wonderful kind woman . " she gave
[482/1000]	nick and chris got out of the suv , opened the trunk , and hauled in the big bag . he stepped back as earl passed by him . " call me later . let 's do it now .
[483/1000]	the woman 's face contorted with fear . she could n't afford to make matters worse , but she had to remember that she was the one in charge . " i 've ordered this room cleared of all
[484/1000]	it was after eleven o'clock when her cell phone rang . " hello , " she said . " he 's home . did you see him ? " " he came with me to get you , but
[485/1000]	" yeah , it was . hey , where are you ? " he asks . " i 'm outside the cabin - just going to walk to the store . " i drop my hand into my pocket
[486/1000]	" are those your plans now , or yours ? " asked the master . " now our plans , " replied the boy . he then sat down under a warm blanket while his captors continued to work
[487/1000]	" how do you know that ? " " i was there , remember ? when i saw you running up to the house . " my memories were n't clear by the time i got home ,
[488/1000]	the smile he provided her seemed entirely too real . his expression reminded her of a wolf who 'd seen the beast hunt in wild times . " i heard a rumor that her brother was playing with her .
[489/1000]	" not yet . " " not until ? " " just until it 's safe to talk to you . who knows how long these events will last ? or maybe not long - " "
[490/1000]	she saw him stop her , <EOS> she did n't have the strength left to fight him off . her arms were tied to the tree . she had no strength . she could not make herself turn around .
[491/1000]	he leaned up against the wall , half of him still hidden . " good . " she lowered her robe and straddled him . she 'd left the sash of his robe spread over her back . he
[492/1000]	" god help me . " ' you tell annie to take control and use it . she 's a pretty little thing . get in the car . " " she has n't started , " i
[493/1000]	she tried to break into a jog , but her feet would n't move . when was the last time she 'd had a run in ? the last time she 'd even had her own car ?
[494/1000]	" why ? " " you do n't always need to know . " " i will ... " she promised . " fine . " she said nothing for so long , only stared at
[495/1000]	she stared at him , seeing the world in his eyes but not hearing that words . she saw that he 'd broken the rules and he told her the truth . he loved the woman she 'd been
[496/1000]	it came to her then , like a flash of lightning out of the blue , and she knew exactly who roland and sai delgado represented and whom he must marry . the old mother , for the people
[497/1000]	" what is it ? " " i do n't know , and i really do n't care . " " how the hell do i know that ? " " you were with me , you
[498/1000]	" hey , that 's not my name , " a deep voice answered , bringing her attention back to her surroundings . she turned her head to find a broad - shouldered man wearing a dark outfit with a
[499/1000]	as the pair approached the door , a tall man in his mid - fifties , with hair cropped short , wearing a gray suit , leaned out from behind the side of the door and looked at them .
[500/1000]	" oh , hello , he just joined us . may be he wants to make some inquiries about things the previous year and see about coming up with something new . " " they were taking him home
[501/1000]	your name is emily , she said quickly , but he did n't respond . she realized he was still talking to himself and put up a hand to stop him . " good . you 're a guest
[502/1000]	" we 'll set a trap , " harkat exclaimed , waving away a man that approached closer . " thank you , " mr. crepsley said calmly . " are you going to kill me ? "

[504/1000]	he did n't seem to be thinking about the decision at all but instead looking into her eyes with a satisfied eye . his arms tightened around her and he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom .
[505/1000]	emma rolled her eyes and turned her attention to her sister . " it 's time for you to be serious when you tell me you 're not going to listen to these creeps , okay ? they 'll just
[506/1000]	i can see her hands shaking as she holds her hand out towards him . " i know me and mark must go . but it 's good to see you . " the two of them start talking
[507/1000]	' when did that happen ? ' ' eight years ago . there 's a man ... a member of the royal family who made us his fortune three years ago . his name is cain . he was
[508/1000]	" he could try . " said lea , still holding salena 's hand . she looked at him and then her hands went on lea 's shoulders . " hold on , lea . ! " said salena
[509/1000]	" what do you want me to do ? take you all the way home ? ride you to your apartment ? " he moved closer to her face . " i hope you 'll be all right ,
[510/1000]	she stared , taking a big swallow . " so what ? " she said to him . " this is the way it works . " " yes , indeed , " he said . " for you
[511/1000]	the smile i give him says so much more and i feel some of my fear leave my body . i realize i 've never actually told him my name . it 's gotten so ingrained . it 's been
[512/1000]	" i do n't feel safe in this room with you , " she whispered . " you 're the only one i can trust . " " we could try to return to the cabin and talk it
[513/1000]	one thing i knew was she wanted his kiss . he kissed her back with equal passion . her tongue tangled with his as her hands moved over his body . it felt good , she thought . it
[514/1000]	" not that shit . i need you to come with me to get a dog . " i stared at mac and i felt like being sick . even mac 's cat 's eyes were wide and alarmed
[515/1000]	" he said you 've been trying to teach me about this kind of thing ... you always have a little bit of it in your head . it 's in your eyes . " " yeah , there
[516/1000]	my chest rumbles at the word , and a dull ache fills my rib cage . " wait . " he looks up at me , wide - eyed , as he pulls my glasses off . " what
[517/1000]	i do n't know what you mean ? she 's not ... she did n't look like herself . they say you looked the same as your cousin ! and i do n't even know what that was about ,
[518/1000]	" go get yourself a meal and read , " said the stranger . the girl went . humik was also sitting on a bench . at the same moment mrs. ma j 's daughter had come to see
[519/1000]	his lips pursed , then i heard him say something . then i felt it ; a little ruffling , like feathers . " a bug , " i said , and he jerked upright , bumping into me
[520/1000]	" now - " he began . " oh , cut the bullshit . " i cut him off and began the process of reaching my own conclusion . " i think you do n't even like women .
[521/1000]	he smiled ruefully . " yes , she was , i doubt that she would want anyone to know . " " no one ? " " a few people . not many , though <EOS> that does

[523/1000]	he 'd only come looking to find it . he wanted to find it now , as it was with kate . he hesitated , and kate opened her eyes . it took a few moments to remember
[524/1000]	' it does n't give you the right to touch my husband . i do n't care what that man wants to do to me and i 'm not going to start now . ' ' that 's what
[525/1000]	they turned the corner of the building , which housed the gym , and then headed down the sloping concrete paths as far as they could go . when they entered a small alcove on the main floor ,
[526/1000]	" have you known ... ? " " she 's a girl . and she 's only sixteen . " " a girl . " " yeah . " " god . how do you deal
[527/1000]	" of course i told you . " i stared into her eyes behind their lashes . my brain was playing tricks on me . the one thing guaranteed to happen , and why ? cause he asked me
[528/1000]	' i 'm not an idiot , ' he snapped back , now even more annoyed than before . ' she 's a little bit crazy . ' ' i do n't think so . ' ' this
[529/1000]	" no , i 'm not . " " oh , you must be scared . you are only two years old . you should be terrified . i 'm going to teach you every proper word you want

[531/1000]	" all of it was me ! " i shout , feeling it 's much better to be punished for the most part . " i thought it was me who said it was n't me who said it was
[532/1000]	i could n't believe that he was here to kill me . " why did you hurt me ? i guess that was n't the first time . " he just stared at me with his sad eyes .
[533/1000]	" i 'm not sure , " i say . " most people just said they could n't think of a better location . " " my uncle had an old piece of wood down there , " he
[534/1000]	" because we are not good enough for each other . " " we are not ? " he does n't answer . " when do you get to know me , grayson ? we 're not that
[535/1000]	she leaned over to give me a quick kiss on the cheek . " it is . " she smiled at nate , and he leaned over to talk with her . " dad , why on earth do
[536/1000]	if she 's getting what she wants and she hates me for it , i wonder if i 'm not going to get what i want , too . fuck , i wonder if i 'm falling for her
[537/1000]	" do not lie to me in the lord 's name , i tell you the truth . have you no loyalty than any all - seeing boy ? " he shook his head . " i would have
[538/1000]	if only that were true ! he 'd like to send you back ... but how many humans did this to their own families , to their kids , and to their sons and daughters , <EOS> - and their
[539/1000]	" why were your parents going ? " " they 're going now . so , do yourself a favor and get out of here ! " i shot back . " but , mom , you 're
[540/1000]	" you better get to opening in four more seconds , you got me ? " but the door closed , and he <EOS> now sat on the bar stool . they were late . now he
[541/1000]	" yeah , i think i will . " he says while moving backward . " so , what 's your favorite meal in the food industry ? " i ask , trying to change the subject .
[542/1000]	" what 's the matter ? " she said suddenly . " everything , " he said . he did n't remember leaving the room . he supposed it was best he did n't . he did n't want
[543/1000]	" that 's not my business . " " sure it is . it belonged to my husband . " and it had belonged to my father . i opened my purse . every time i stopped doing
[544/1000]	' the next time you decide to do something like that , i 'll be forced to shut you up . ' he leaned down , his lips brushing against mine . ' and when i do , i 'll
[545/1000]	" there 's a bar not too far from the old main road . i have to get there . the phone goes down here on the way . if i need to find you or to get an update
[546/1000]	" there is the matter of the identity of a woman who has been identified by her husband 's name . " miss tarabotti shrugged . " she should have an alias . " sir marcus narrowed his eyes
[547/1000]	i turned a page , then another . they all seemed to feel the same intensity . her voice broke my concentration . " you 're starting to distract me . " i did n't turn back to
[548/1000]	" i 'll be there . " i went to the door . " talk soon . " she turned back to the computer . a huge smile stretched across her face , but before i could leave ,
[549/1000]	" what 's this ? " " a bottle of wine i 've picked up early this week . it has a small cork , so i would n't have expected anyone to be here . " she flipped
[550/1000]	" i guess we 'd better get going before he changes his mind now that you 're too pregnant to drive any more . " when they got inside , blake gave the driver a hundred dollars . he
[551/1000]	when he was standing beside the big bed in holly 's room , he heard voices from downstairs . * * * " he 'll break down at any moment , " holly muttered , thinking aloud .
[552/1000]	what was the use ? her mind wandered to the men who had done this to her - the ones who had nearly killed her . the men who had put cole in his place , or the ones who
[553/1000]	he rolled her out from beneath him , still trying to make her smile with hot kisses . he had come back for her then and she did n't blame him . he was really leaving and she missed him
[554/1000]	the rest of the way back to bed charlie asked again if his mom was coming home tonight . she promised to be there in about twenty minutes . he was glad , as he did n't want to go
[555/1000]	he did not try to hide his smile , which did it well , and he added , " i 'm glad your eyes are showing <EOS> so - <EOS> , you little girl . ' " she giggled at
[556/1000]	she gave a little nod . " thank you . " a beat passed . " well then . " " i have to call a car . " " we 'll walk together . "
[557/1000]	" yes sir , " " one more thing , mr. president , how did you know that the american people had the right to vote ? " " it 's an honor to put their lives in your
[558/1000]	all i had to do was pick two of them for me - the first and the last . my dad and alec 's mom will be worried sick about me since they have n't seen me in months .
[559/1000]	" you have n't slept a wink in ages . i 'm concerned . " " i 'm fine - i could n't sleep . i tried for hours , but i kept waking up in the bed ,
[560/1000]	the driver pulled to a halt in front of the door , and the doorman opened it up for me . i stepped out , brushing my dress and the top of my silk skirt . i did n't know
[561/1000]	" really ? did it teach you nothing ? " " i am not an idiot . i can tell the most fascinating stuff . just like i can spot you . so i get excited - or maybe
[562/1000]	i had to warn her to stay away from the kid . i had to give her time to think about what to do . " dad , listen ... i should n't treat her like that . "
[563/1000]	" shit , " i said . " we know her name is naomi . if jessica had wanted to use this person to get close to you , she could have pulled off the coup at any time
[564/1000]	at that moment , the sound of the horn and someone 's jeep came nearer and someone moved from behind the cover of the road sign that just showed up on the dashboard and announced " arrival here at ten
[565/1000]	" do n't tell me where you 're living , and do n't tell anyone about this place . " " please . " she reached out and took the picture out of his hands . " i do

[567/1000]	slowly he shook his head . " i 'm sorry . i 'm just mad at myself . i should have talked to you . " " i could 've handled things in my own way , nick .
[568/1000]	i had an idea . it was on the tip of my tongue to say , " how about i drop you off at home today and come over this evening ? we can watch some shows , or
[569/1000]	" it 's kind of sad , is n't it ? " mrs. abbott said . the woman placed both hands on the table , holding the letter up before her face . " you 're missing my point
[570/1000]	" ok . " " do n't worry . anything you can do , remember that . " " ok . " " we 'll see you tomorrow night . try to figure out something plausible .
[571/1000]	" i 'll bet . " he takes me by the waist and lifts me slightly . he bends his head and goes in , bringing his lips back to mine , so close i can hear the soft
[572/1000]	" you have n't seen me since early the morning you broke down the door with a crowbar and told me that you had to find another job . " " i 'm sorry , " he said .
[573/1000]	his mother reached into the front pocket of her gray slacks and handed over one of the small , brown envelopes that she had drawn from the pile . her family had given them over centuries of hard work and
[574/1000]	" no , you 've got something . what 's that ? " " i 'm going to read . " he leaned forward and brushed the pad of paper with his lips across hers . his tongue swiped
[575/1000]	" so that 's why i did n't trust you , " i said . " really ? " her brow puckered , and her smile brightened as she turned to face me . " i did n't think
[576/1000]	" i heard that you 're quite good . can you tell me what it 's like to be your age ? " " i do n't think - " my sentence trails when i feel his hand graze

[580/1000]	it was an order . " now ! " said the other men . " i am commander , " replied the vampire . " i am in command of all vampires . i will be here until the
[581/1000]	" we 're not in a store , we were in bed with a woman . " she shook her head in confusion . " what woman ? " " the woman who took me out of bed
[582/1000]	' your mother 's right . it 's the only way it could start . ' gregory reached his hand out to a blank page and drew them out . a face appeared in the pages . '
[583/1000]	" maybe we 'll invite a few of our friends around to the party , " he suggested . " maybe they 'll have enough room to do whatever they like . " the thought of him going to
[584/1000]	i frowned . " what 's going on ? " he looked at me sharply . " do n't do anything rash , kid . i might as well give you some protection from the others to stop .
[585/1000]	" so , you just had a crush on him too ? " sarah asked eagerly . there was silence . " what , i mean his dad ? " sarah asked . " no ! "
[586/1000]	the fact did n't bother me , then . maybe because i was an expert ? maybe because i knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was <EOS> ... ? i could n't deal with anyone
[587/1000]	he frowned . " why not ? " " well , i never ... did n't know you were coming and , well ... " " you never know ... " " what the hell ? "
[588/1000]	the two of them stared at each other . " you 're the oldest , " he said , smiling , " he is the youngest . " " he 's still a boy , " beth argued
[589/1000]	" you know i am , " he agreed . she lifted her head and kissed him , her lips lingering for only a moment before drawing away again . " and in the end , it will all

[593/1000]	" my god . i ca n't believe we thought we were being rescued , " rachel whispered . " do you think it 's really me ? did n't you tell me to trust my intuition ? "
[594/1000]	" no reason , " said the reporter . " we just want to make sure you have your facts straight . " " well , there 's that ... " i heard a commotion outside of the
[595/1000]	he smiled . " but a moment it all sounded so good . " maybe it sounded great . she looked out the window and he watched her for a moment , watching her eyes , the curve of her
[596/1000]	" why not for the way you 've helped me ? " she asked him . " i 've worked with a couple of your deputies before , and i have some advice about how not to do what
[597/1000]	he ignored her offer . " you got some important things to tell me . " " yes , " he conceded . " you were right . i am a fool . " " well ,
[598/1000]	but that 's not what this is about . you do n't need to make the argument and tell me that , in that case , all i need is for you to let go of that box of love
[599/1000]	i did n't answer . i just looked at him . neither of us was ready . " you wo n't be happy when i have to leave , if that 's what you 're worrying about . "
[600/1000]	i felt that you could read them and then read something deeper than that and ask , " what had to do with that ? " the other women giggled . i 'd spent them all - or
[601/1000]	i think about what he said and my stomach ro ils . is this really how it 's going to work ? everyone thinks i have a weird disease i 'm not allowed to see . what did it say
[602/1000]	" as all of you know , i 've been having problems following the instructions we received in las vegas , and when i return from my meeting with the team in las vegas , i 'm required to return
[603/1000]	i look closer and it 's obvious that if i want to , i 'll need to go right now . but what i ca n't figure out is why he needs my help . what would he do if
[604/1000]	" did they ask where i got this ? " i asked , taking out the letter . he opened it and read the words i just read , " for god 's sake . " i held
[605/1000]	her lips pursed in indecision before she finally nodded . " ok , i agree . but , what happens if i fail ? " " if that happens , do n't let it happen . " she
[606/1000]	her face softened . " you were right on the money for her , too . i 'm glad she 's happy . " " so am i. " she gave him a quick kiss before stepping back
[607/1000]	" all right , " she said , her voice growing very quiet . " but this is a private thing . you can tell a lot about me . " " you can tell me anything , "
[608/1000]	" yes , i was very surprised . i did n't even really think the rumors were true . i mean , i expected someone more powerful . " " even my parents , a couple of generations of
[609/1000]	" i will pass , " i said , feeling the heat of the sun on my face . " tomorrow will be a different story . " " you should have asked me for help before trying to
[610/1000]	" she can tell everyone , ca n't she ? " he said in an excited whisper . " the big girl and the big boy . " " you 're so romantic , darling . " "
[611/1000]	" no way ! " as the guard behind her began to move , she slid her dagger across his chest , then reached for the man 's pistol . as the guard fell , she kicked it away
[612/1000]	" they love him to death with his heart still beating . " " so , i guess they do have that in common , then ? " " more you would think . " he did
[613/1000]	a sudden thought occurred to me . that he might not want to leave me after all . " do you remember when we first met ? when you showed me that picture in new york . remember that night
[614/1000]	he 'd make a deal with me . " i swear , if you do n't tell me about the twins i 'll slit your throat . " " i do n't want your help , " she
[615/1000]	finally , she stood and stepped toward his side . only one thing stayed in her mind , the same thing she 'd never asked him about before . she wanted to touch him . <EOS> f * * king
[616/1000]	for a moment , the three of us are close enough to grasp each other . i could run , hide . but what would they do to him ? i feel her hand snake down to land on
[617/1000]	" you must have given a damn , huh ? " she smiled and slid back into his lap . " guess i 'll get used to it when we see each other again . how 's that ? "
[618/1000]	" i 'm sorry . that was ... unexpected . " " it always is , " he said simply . " you thought this is the end of me ? " " i would n't blame you
[619/1000]	" oh , we ca n't use this . i would n't want to be caught in a rat 's nest , " he said . <EOS> <EOS> " " all yours in the basement of the castle of
[620/1000]	" i 'm going to have to , " she said . " not to mention you ought to be at the beach by now . " another shiver ran up her spine , making her feel cold
[621/1000]	" is that a yes ? " she asked softly . after a pause she gave a little nod . i nodded back . " i have no idea , but thanks . you know it 's hard to
[622/1000]	" with what , madame ? " madame lefoux asked . " my husband is no longer a member , " alexia admitted . " he is a bur official . " " but are you leaving the
[623/1000]	the man looked down at him with contempt . " some of my men feel very privileged that you know what you can do with a blade . look at this blade . " he placed the shaft of the
[624/1000]	" do n't worry . " she slid forward , resting her head on his neck as he wrapped his arms around her , hugging her closer . " i can keep you safe . " " i 'm
[625/1000]	" who says ? " i 'm the one who says it . " who do you think said it ? " i ask . i do n't sound like any of them . " whoever it was did
[626/1000]	her mind did n't process the knowledge ; only the feeling of freedom . " then you may leave , " he snapped . " but not until i have finished my business and returned to this room by

[629/1000]	" in fact i meant it . " they were leaving , heading for the hall that led back to the rooms below , when the vampire who 'd led them out of dar c u 's room shouted
[630/1000]	" come on into the building , " he repeated . " we can talk there . i 'll work on your hands with gloves . " i pushed my glasses up on my nose and followed him into

[633/1000]	" very well , then . i will give the police a call and tell them why i must find them . " " what a shame you wo n't be home today mr. jones . you must continue
[634/1000]	she did n't know why she wanted to say anything . " so last night had nothing to do with that ? " she asked . " no . " " how could it have ? it
[635/1000]	" so ? " " has to mean nothing ! " " bullshit ! you 're my best friend . someone told your mom because you talk so funny ! you 're an idiot ! " "
[636/1000]	" what have you done to me ? " alex shrugged . " i 'm doing all i can to see to your life . i just want to make sure you take care of yourself , and i
[637/1000]	" good . " she nodded slightly . " so , how do you do it ? " i watched her close her eyes . i wondered what it was like to be a vampire . " can
[638/1000]	it was what he 'd expected . " you 're a lucky woman to have this , " he murmured thickly . she blinked , apparently stunned by his reaction . " ha ha , i 'm
[639/1000]	" stop it right right now . " the doctor stepped towards us . " you should probably go home and pack . you 'll be staying home with us until this whole mess blows over . "
[640/1000]	" he 's had a stressful day ! " i shouted as i threw the sheet at his head . i saw his eyebrows furrow as he stared down at the bed . " are you sure you 're
[641/1000]	the boys looked at their father who appeared to be out of breath . they knew this was probably the first time he had been out in the cold in three years . after they were sure they were
[642/1000]	" that 's a great idea , " kate said . " you can eat down here . i 'm sure we can find you something cold . " they moved to the kitchen area and kate saw a
[643/1000]	" it 's late . " he let out a long sigh . " and you 're going to believe it , i know , but i really am sorry . " she did n't know why ,
[644/1000]	she had to say thank you . ' now that that is done . ' ' yes , please . ' ' thank you ... do n't mention it . ' ' no , never . '
[645/1000]	" is it , " i say quietly , my stomach already beginning to turn . " of course it is . but you also said that it 's very important . " i raise my hand to
[646/1000]	" i 'll meet you in the bar on the sidewalk . " " right , " he says . i 'm walking down the sidewalk without even looking at him . my skin feels like it 's
[647/1000]	by the end of my last english class , i 'd lost all sense of where we were , where we sat . a short while later , christian and christian were at a booth near the bathrooms .
[648/1000]	now , i 'm also feeling the pressure of worry from both of my parents over what 's coming , and knowing that right now , if they 're not at the hospital in one minute , as soon as
[649/1000]	" this is going to be really hard for you . " " you think so ? " she laughed , the sound slightly unsteady . " i had n't realized how nervous i was before you ;
[650/1000]	" what was that ? " grace asked . " shh . " the room darkened . " a man ... " " what is it ? " grace asked . " i think i 'm alone
[651/1000]	" you 're here to see him ? " she glanced downward at my chest . " obviously . " " well , excuse . you certainly need to get inside . " she backed away from me
[652/1000]	" i would n't have brought you here if i had n't thought you 'd actually enjoy it . " " yeah , something like that . " but he realized the feeling had n't gone away .
[653/1000]	" you heard him ; maybe if he was a better man , he would ever want to be someone better or less than he was . " she held his gaze , her arms folded across her chest
[654/1000]	" <EOS> " " it sure sounds cool . ' " " then , a couple of hours ago , we arrived , saw you , and picked up you . it all happened so fast . "
[655/1000]	* * * i 'd already lost my temper with her at work , but since this date , i could n't help her if i did n't play nice . i was n't going to give her any
[656/1000]	" i know <EOS> you , " she says , smiling . the smile is gone . her eyes look sad , lost . " what can i do for you ? i do n't work or have any clients
[657/1000]	" is that even possible ? " he was beginning to sense a pattern to this man 's visits . " do they really think she did it ? i mean , she used the same words every time they
[658/1000]	my hand slid down and wrapped around his shaft , and his entire body went tight against mine . he leaned forward to take me off of him and i tried not to cry out when i felt the
[659/1000]	the woman with the gun turned around with a threatening frown on her pretty face . she went back to her book and went on with her pages . the woman in the sunglasses returned her attention to the wall
[660/1000]	" ah ... " he frowned . " what are you talking about ? " the whole universe seemed to tilt in the same direction , but i did n't know why . this was so much more complicated
[661/1000]	they met in the lobby of the hospital and immediately headed for the elevators . " what 's wrong ? " carol said when she saw them making their way to the emergency room . " we 've
[662/1000]	" me too . i wo n't lie . it makes me mad i have to go without . " " no , i do <EOS> ' all that - and you 'll never <EOS> in the eye .
[663/1000]	" there is no threat of anything . " he pauses , and then takes a deep breath . " just get an abortion . " chapter twenty six months later " you sure about that ?
[664/1000]	" you are , " jamie said . " and i thank thee for it , uncle . " " your sister died before i was born , " he said simply . " i suppose her family tried
[665/1000]	" what ? like f * * king your sister is n't bad ? i 'll trade in her brain for her guts . " " no . i mean exactly what i said . " " how
[666/1000]	" god , i f * * king love you . i have to breathe , jess . " " then do it , luke . please , like you said , push me past my fear , because
[667/1000]	he did n't answer . he just turned to leave . she wrapped her arms tighter around his neck . " tell me something . " " what ? " " are you ever going to get
[668/1000]	i was beginning to believe he was . i got to my feet and saw i was right . there were , what appeared like , a dozen cars parked up a street at the far end . the
[669/1000]	" what ? " i had a sudden case of the eye - rolling and his face darkened . he knew what i was thinking ; he could smell it against his skin . " i know . "
[670/1000]	he wanted to yell . " you 've got quite a way to go then , you know . by the time i get to her , she 'll be so drunk she 'll be a laugh ing stock .
[671/1000]	" yes . but i forgot <EOS> - all i did n't like to have to ... they used to be an endless run and , i wished very , but it 'll sit between the old idea and the
[672/1000]	if i 'm one of them , i think i deserve to be treated like a king . i feel like i have a power i do n't deserve to have , but i 'm not . i doubt i
[673/1000]	from the moment she saw him , nothing in her life had been perfect , just as she 'd imagined . but when he held out the paper with his photo , she wanted to just throw herself into
[674/1000]	" why not ? " " you know why . there 's an inside joke between the two of us . when i 'm about to f * * k , anything less than this is a sexual assault
[675/1000]	" this is for you , " the stranger smiled . " this ring of yours was created without me . i mean you no harm . i 'm no threat and go where it tells me to go .
[676/1000]	" a bad day , but it appears they 're all safe . what are they doing to them ? " i demanded . " i do n't know where they are taken . they 're headed for some
[677/1000]	<EOS> and then " i said " over and over in my head , a thing of the past , but as soon as i spoke it was impossible to pretend anything better than the question at the time .
[678/1000]	" ah , a man of principle . " the witch was n't quite sure she should believe this . she felt <EOS> for the excitement that would drive me out of the cellar . it was all so horrible
[679/1000]	we 're in my office a little after ten . it 's a small , one - bedroom office , much like most work space of a professional loft apartment , probably designed to attract staff mostly and business associates
[680/1000]	" what ? " she squeaked . " i - what if you ca n't get something out of me ? " i pressed . was i really out of line ? " i do n't know .
[681/1000]	" no . it 's good to see you , but your eyes were swollen again , and it was like you were blind . " she lowered her voice again , still looking at me with sympathy . "

[683/1000]	he gave jane a stern , parental look . she could always count on her husband when she needed him most . after all , her father had saved her life more than ten times over . " can
[684/1000]	" yeah , well you did n't save much . " " it 's okay , i 'll get everything else . i do n't even need all the clothes . " " you 're not going to
[685/1000]	with a frown , she stared at the papers and flipped through . there was no time to wonder . once more , the two - dozen - paper - piles piled around her were the ones her mother had
[686/1000]	" he knows , " she says . " we ca n't stop him . he loves her . he wants her . " " i love sarah . i have for a long time . " she
[687/1000]	" i forgot . i 'll take the rest of tonight off . " " i 'll drive you home , " she said as she pulled the car back onto the road . " it might be a
[688/1000]	" fine . " " what happened ? " i took her hands in mine and ran them slowly over the soft skin of her cheeks , " i 've been thinking about what you put in your

[690/1000]	he had no idea what to expect when he stepped out into the sunshine . and it did n't feel right . " what time are you off ? " he asked her sister . " lunch break
[691/1000]	she leaned back against the window , <EOS> in deep pain . " i do n't want to be a spy ... " " i need you - the two people who wo n't give me reason to think
[692/1000]	" please . " her hand rose instinctively and she closed her fingers around his . her touch was light against his skin . he could n't stop the involuntary shake that was pulling at his shoulders . suddenly
[693/1000]	" my brother died because of me , " i said , thinking back to our " argument , " " he was a good brother , and i liked him , and there went all my pride with that
[694/1000]	" thanks . " he smiled , the faintest hint of a smile , before turning back to the boy . " let 's leave first thing in the morning . " " okay , but then we
[695/1000]	" can you carry you through the gate ? " " i do n't know , " she said . " it looked pretty heavy to me . that and i do n't want you to fall , or
[696/1000]	the lights dimmed . the sound of gunfire grew audible , but the darkness surrounding them did not lessen . seichan dropped back and crouched behind a large box . had the other gunmen entered ? she counted seven
[697/1000]	" are you coming ? " her hand squeezed my arm and i started to shrug it off , but she tugged back , giving me a strange look that was so familiar , and she had n't even
[698/1000]	" yes , i did . " a sigh . " come , i 'll show you what there is to see . i 've been saving my best . " the two women followed the man up four
[699/1000]	" be nice , " i muttered , and took a quick sip . it was n't that much , but the smell of it helped . what seemed a very long time ago was just a few weeks ago
[700/1000]	" of course . it 's not unusual . there 's nothing to tell . " " that 's exactly what my father says . " that was the problem about the media . there was n't a
[701/1000]	she reached up and took the clip out of her hair , letting it slip free and fall into her eyes . he frowned . " do n't close yourself off . " she glanced back at him
[702/1000]	" let 's just say now i do n't believe in love at first sight . " " i do n't understand . are you two in love ? " " we 've been married for six years
[703/1000]	after all , it was a short day . as her companions finished discussing it , she became extremely happy . it would be so much fun to be with such an intelligent and smart person as mary .
[704/1000]	" good . do n't just stand there acting like you expect to get the next meal . we need to pick up a few things to take then we can leave . " seth pulled out a large
[705/1000]	" we were at one night 's party when you showed up . that 's when i started showing up . other than that , all i know about him is that he is n't married . he is a
[706/1000]	" you call me that again and i 'll kill you . " he closed his eyes tight , and his breathing was fast . " go away . " the beast stirred inside her , trying to release
[707/1000]	that was n't what i had in mind . i was afraid that when we made love we would get angry again , so i was n't sure if i could keep our verbal barriers up for long . instead
[708/1000]	the next bit he asked was <EOS> " do you know where the man is ? " just then a man stood from an ornate chair . a tall , powerful man who was taller than even a man
[709/1000]	i made a face and looked over the back of the couch to see seth 's wide eyes with a grimace . " i promise i 'll go back on my word . i promise i wo n't hit
[710/1000]	" it 's all right if it was - " she glanced at the laptop and the two missing paintings . " but they were gone . the studio . all of them . " he pulled her
[711/1000]	" i do , " said her mother , a flash of gold in her eyes . " then we will get it . " she paused , and a look of sudden concern crossed her face . "
[712/1000]	" here when you are with the king , it is like a different world . so many different ways you have been , and it has never felt the same for me . " " but every man
[713/1000]	" i 'm guessing you work out in the gym . " i knew what he was doing , i knew he was trying to show off , but when it came to us , he only wanted to hurt
[714/1000]	" no ... you . i 'm not looking for anything . i 'm not even a complete jerk . " he pulled back a little and rested his forehead against mine . " but i understand if you 'd
[715/1000]	" i 'm not sure . " " then i suggest you find out . " " dad . " he held up his hand to stop her . " go to sleep . " she
[716/1000]	" if you leave now they will have a very interested report on my whereabouts from here . " " we could find a hiding place . " " do not dare go back home ; " she
[717/1000]	" you 're lucky i 'm sitting next to you tonight . " i felt like i was in the top hat . " glad you 're there , but was n't we kind of supposed to be somewhere
[718/1000]	her voice was strained and angry . " there 's no reason to think that you 've ever taken me under your wing . i will not accept this . " his mother 's expression hardened . " i
[719/1000]	the two men moved towards the house , the woman with the stick in hand . the old woman was looking at the old woman , waiting for a response . the old woman walked from the house , walking
[720/1000]	<EOS> ' but you should n't have . i know , but it does n't always happen that way , and i feel like i should n't be so forgiving of your way of thinking like it still does .
[721/1000]	what did that sound like ? " i said i had to go , " he repeated , in a more controlled voice . " i know i 'm being a jerk , but it 's only been six
[722/1000]	" it 's my personal favorite , " he said with an intense look in his eyes , " and i 've been in love with it for a long time . " he put his arms around me
[723/1000]	" sure . " the boy made something with his arms in the air . his arms were long and muscular and his spine was powerful . he was tall , but thin like a boy of fourteen . his
[724/1000]	a moment later , another call came . " come on . we need to talk . " the car accelerated out of the driveway and onto the road . thirty - five seconds later , they
[725/1000]	i took a bit with my mouth . i noticed that my tongue was getting stuck as i continued . " i do love you so much . i love that you 're giving up on us . what i
[726/1000]	and it was ! not merely that he was incredibly uncomfortable . nothing about his future prospects shocked him . he could see himself marrying mary ann and getting a wife someday , a life he would never have and
[727/1000]	" yeah , with us too , " said the general . " a good , strong , virile fighter like you . how far gone do you think he could get if i asked him to marry you ?
[728/1000]	and in the end it was a waste of a pleasant walk . in the morning it was all that he needed . there was nothing more to be seen ; there was no room left to explore . they
[729/1000]	" <EOS> i think he actually seemed alright , did he ? " " not at all bad , though . he got rid of the camera , and i have it in my glove box . your dog
[730/1000]	" it looked like you were both wearing bikinis , " she joked and looked down at his trousers . he was looking down at her the whole time , but her face was so flushed that it took
[731/1000]	you will be . as their guardian , you will have to watch your back for the rest of their life . they will always attack on your watch . and they will always be too strong . " his
[732/1000]	" what should we do ? " " i do n't know . " " then i suggest you get to your room . please . " he stood and pulled me in by the hand .
[733/1000]	" hey , i guess you and that little bitch are just going to make me stay . " " enough , " she said sternly . i had n't even noticed , but the little vampire had
[734/1000]	" well she 's taking such good care of you . do n't worry , i 've probably talked her into giving you a raise . " " uh huh . is that what her boss says too ?
[735/1000]	i 'm not giving up so easily ; i grab her hands and hold on so hard i want to scream . " the f * * k ? you have to back off . i have to finish this
[736/1000]	she still did n't hear him . she had to listen to him , despite the pain , did n't she ? ' are you okay , mummy ? ' a light , feathery touch touched her cheek .
[737/1000]	" no . i 'm not . " she shrugged . he sighed . " okay , since you want to go through here , we 'll go through here . " she took the magazine and dropped it
[738/1000]	she stood on the top step , holding the box . there was a long , uncomfortable silence . silence because that 's when she noticed the flowers . " oh , hi , " she said , giving him
[739/1000]	" the kids ca n't understand <EOS> , " dad had said to me before , almost all these long , beautiful days in the hospital as an alien . not that i was proud of the days when anything
[740/1000]	" i can not believe how calm you 've become , my angel , " replied lord legg id . " i wonder if that was a good idea when you said your wife would n't marry you . "
[741/1000]	and he knew this without a doubt . when he touched her , a soft , tentative smile teased his lips . " this is your fault , " he rasped . she shook her head .
[742/1000]	" i love them , but ... " she looks over her shoulder at me and i see it . " but what ? " i ask . " look at the way the water feels behind
[743/1000]	" just get on with it , cole . " he lowered his fist and then pointed his finger at me . " i take it ? " " i ca n't just go on the job ...
[744/1000]	" i 'll stay with you . you might not like my opinion since i 'm new here , but do n't count me out of the party ; i know you have an important meeting in half an hour
[745/1000]	i took a breath . " i would have liked to think so . " we would have come to a crossroads . " just promise me you wo n't tell anyone , " i said .
[746/1000]	" i 'm not blind , " said lily impatiently . there was a light at the end of the corridor . she stepped past him . he muttered something under his breath . " what 'd you say
[747/1000]	" then we have about twenty - five minutes more that we will have to be careful . in fact , the minute we get a clue about this , we are going to have to be far , far

[749/1000]	chapter 28 when ben came down the long corridor , the noise from the ship was replaced by the din of activity along the corridor in the main room . a couple of the officers waved at him as
[750/1000]	" well , one more question . is it true ? were we all created between the worlds ? " " yes , our planet was the first . earth was the first . no , to put it
[751/1000]	the question caught him off guard . why did she care ? he usually caught her too easily . it was because she was n't here tonight to enjoy the show . maybe she 'd been with a guy ,
[752/1000]	the boy said nothing . " i mean it , " said the prince . " i want to be safe with you , " the boy said . " do n't say it , please ,
[753/1000]	<EOS> and the way you can see the truth of the human world for yourself . her thumb stroked his chin . " i 'm the reason you fell in love with that animal . i made him believe
[754/1000]	" they call them the great whites . " " but ca n't they raise black soldiers ? " " so far as i know no white soldiers have joined up . " my throat was dry
[755/1000]	i looked at bo , hoping that he 'd tell me why he 'd been so angry when he 'd first noticed me . i thought about al the time i 'd wasted alone at bo 's side , wondering
[756/1000]	" i 'd love him to . " or her . no , that was n't the right word . more an emotion , a personal emotion . a feeling that had blossomed and bloomed , in some small
[757/1000]	" go ahead , " his opponent said firmly . " his opponent is a veteran scholar , " ser dan ae informed him . " he 'll have a chance . " " we 'll see ,
[758/1000]	" she 's got to be , right ? where is she , then ? " " i do n't know . she disappeared . she swore she was going nowhere . " " i still do n't
[759/1000]	he looked shocked . " for what ? " " for talking about a lot of things i do n't want to discuss . does that make sense to you ? " " i do n't know .
[760/1000]	as she crossed the street , she wondered one more time if the dark green suv was after her . " that was a fast trip , " jake said as he joined her . " how fast
[761/1000]	the woman nodded . " you have had several hours of sleep and need to rest . now just lie still . " " thank you . i will . " when the doctor left , meredith stared
[762/1000]	as the rain began to fall , a dog began to bark . " this better be worth a shit , you sonofabitch . " he turned , his voice catching on the last word . a silver
[763/1000]	" you are ? " matt asked , in a low voice . she grinned . " yes , no . maybe . i ca n't remember for sure . " matt was growing irritated . she had
[764/1000]	" yeah , " he answers . his voice turns low and dark and i 'm instantly instantly wary of him . " i was going to ask you first . but you were on a training mission for six
[765/1000]	and the fact he 'd brought them here made her feel both sad - which happened to be the case with this week . " hey , " she said , stepping toward them . " we 're just
[766/1000]	" now ... just remember to be careful . you seem to be getting along with your dad and then , before long . " i nodded , not because i thought she was right or not , but
[767/1000]	he was so caught up in his mission that he forgot about the phone . when he finally caught up with her , he was surprised that she was completely dressed . with a pair of bright yellow bikini panties
[768/1000]	she gave me a knowing look but said nothing . " i hope i 'm the only man who gets to see you with a gun , " i teased , getting up and taking off my t -
[769/1000]	i take a quick shower and wipe the sweat and dirt from my upper body . i apply some light makeup that i do n't think i can make off with in this place . then i swipe on some
[770/1000]	" why do you hate me so much ? " " because i thought you 'd kill me the moment you found out . " " you thought wrong . besides , we 'll never be together ,
[771/1000]	" of course you are . with that kind of power , you might be able to change the future . " " why ? " " because this is the one place where time does n't seem
[772/1000]	it was n't for the slightest reason ; sometimes things do happen to people you follow closely . and the last thing she 'd expected was a guy like colin . so why did she even think he
[773/1000]	he does n't respond , does n't move from the room . he 's looking at me . the skin beneath my eyes burns , and my hair is sitting on my shoulder and shoulders now , and i suddenly
[774/1000]	" that 's the only time i 've ever heard anyone say they hate the idea of being a doctor , " said sarah , her cheeks flaming . i let out a laugh on cue , because i
[775/1000]	" but you were dead to us . " " that was a good day , " i said , smiling down at her . i was n't used to sharing the same sentiment with my son ,
[776/1000]	" i guess it would fit you better , do n't you think ? " " yeah , it should , " i said , and then , because he 'd gotten the message now : " i 'll
[777/1000]	" was that the first person you saw on the street ? was that ... " the doctor paused . " what the hell happened ? " " nothing , " she said flatly . " nothing ?
[778/1000]	" who else knows you have it ? " he held up a hand . " not that i know of . " " i do n't know anyone else with mine . " she looked around the
[779/1000]	he reached her and opened the door . " when we found you , you were unconscious . you fought us . " " i was dreaming . " she took his hand gently and turned it so
[780/1000]	mike turned and looked out over the grounds at the people crowding the beach , but he could n't see any one guy in the crowd . instead , he could see the beach . he needed blood .
[781/1000]	" what , are you going to read the bible ? " he chuckled . " what is it about ? " " what ? " " you 're not going to read it all down to
[782/1000]	" of course he has him back , " the redhead said . " he just did n't think it would be the right time . he ca n't afford to be a fool . not with the way his
[783/1000]	one day soon , a group of young men brought a beautiful piece of wood up from the bottom of a hill called the wall and their faces were filled with concern . the young girls looked at him ,
[784/1000]	" what ? " " i do n't know ... it was just nice having you here with my family . nobody has ever done me like that before . i never knew how much i needed you .
[785/1000]	we talked about many things - everything from childhood boyfriends and the movie we 'd had her favorite shows and favorite movies , and even a little music that sounded weird for a private audience . i was n't sure
[786/1000]	" really ? " he nodded . " oh , this is a lovely surprise . " i folded my arms on the table . he chuckled and reached for my hand in his . " i
[787/1000]	" i do wish you had n't said anything about my father . " " he still loves you . it 's only natural he would stop thinking about you . you do n't need to worry about him
[788/1000]	" and i was a princess ! just a princess in my homeland of i do lam ka . they thought i would become ' strong ' ... but i was , they said . with the help of others
[789/1000]	" you told me we would n't work and that your parents would n't have <EOS> ... " but my mother had gone with me , but mom just took one night . the thought was so many things .
[790/1000]	" i 'm too smart for you - that 's why i need you . " " stop acting like it 's my fault . you 've put me through too much . i do n't need your help
[791/1000]	" do you really need to check out his ass too ? " ryder asked , looking up at the table , where the guys were taking a break . " with a girl ? do n't be the one
[792/1000]	" we both knew it was n't going to be that simple . we found it a challenge to work together , but the challenge could lead to disaster . " " you 've been taking risks since you
[793/1000]	" oh . great . " i felt relief flood through me . " then why do you say that - why do n't you just go away ? why do n't you just go look your dad in the
[794/1000]	" oh my god , baby , that feels so good . " " so do it again , okay ? like that , " she shouts out . her legs rock . her arms flail and she 's
[795/1000]	" i heard that , " rachel called up as she passed . she lifted the collar of her sweater and tried not to shift more than necessary . " how is your morning going ? " ethan called
[796/1000]	just then a voice answered and as it did so jenny 's insides went cold . it was the voice of some great god . " shut up , " the voice hissed . " you are never singing
[797/1000]	he did n't say anything . instead , he sat in the chair across from them to gather his thoughts . eventually , i helped him by handing him my lunch . i did n't mention that i 'd only
[798/1000]	" yeah . but she 's still no good . she 's a wreck . my ex - wife used to be like this . she lost everything . " " i 'm so sorry for you . "
[799/1000]	" no man has been able to read your mind since that night . we all want to believe that your pain is part of something new but you do n't . " " whatever , " i answered
[800/1000]	three times the size of my hand , and with no obvious physical strength behind it i could do nothing but watch her with heavy hooded eyes . her clothes were made - of her sweat and the sweat of
[801/1000]	" why do you persist on thinking that ? " she threw him a knowing look . " you know why , " he insisted , annoyed with her silence before he answered . " i can still
[802/1000]	he looked up at her , the smile in his eyes more seductive than ever . " say it . " what was she supposed to say ? " i love you , jake . " she kissed him
[803/1000]	there had been a small pause before her mouth went to his , but when he did n't resist , she drew in a breath and released the lock on her chains . taking her by the hand ,
[804/1000]	so when you think about it , it 's not such a bad thing to know your family 's in trouble . " " seriously . " " okay . let 's say we do become angry with
[805/1000]	" i wo n't be home until morning , " he said softly . " i promise . " she felt the relief that washed over her only moments before like a river . " good , " she
[806/1000]	" i am but a servant to lady teleri . i will be in command of this household . " he turned his broad back toward longsword and watched the woman as she passed , holding her head high and
[807/1000]	" i 'm glad i could help , " i told her , not looking at her , " because i can see as well as anyone <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> completely missing that you are more than that . you
[808/1000]	" ' t would look strange in the records , " said be ddle , looking suddenly worried . " not at all , " said caliban . " they are the result of a fairly powerful signal .
[809/1000]	" yes , " she said dryly , but she could n't help smiling . " well , i 'd like to have my name spelled out in big , big , bold letters that says , ' i love
[810/1000]	i look over at him and he shakes his head . i 'm not going to get help . he does n't say anything else for a bit and i 'm tempted to sneak up on him to
[811/1000]	i had no idea how to react to this . well , no longer thinking , at least . i still could n't imagine myself , or anyone else , getting a chance to witness a bloodbath . it would
[812/1000]	" thanks , yeah , but thanks for the offer , just got ta go , " she said and got up . " so he told you i called ? " i said as i went to put
[813/1000]	that 's all it was . at least she 's keeping it . some of my concern disappears . this is the sister for whom i have always wanted a daughter - someone to share all my bad news
[814/1000]	" but ... this means you have to get home , " she said . " there is n't anyone i could really blame for this . " " the police do this a lot . the guy does
[815/1000]	but she 'd left , she 'd run from him to avoid thinking about it . she 'd known if she turned him away again he 'd get so angry then he would snap . she 'd known she needed
[816/1000]	" so if i were to take you somewhere you were sure you would like to go , what would it be ? " " who asked you to take me ? really . are you suggesting that i
[817/1000]	" and when you have ? " " i 'll tell you when i have . " " the problem is , i do n't want to have the baby , " she said . that hurt
[818/1000]	" are all of the others in your home ? " the girl inquired , surprised by the unexpected question . there was no response . for a moment she wondered if maybe she 'd been out in the street
[819/1000]	" okay ... " i responded . i would not take any of this so - called real ! these idiots can not take me seriously , that 's all i wanted to tell them . the two men
[820/1000]	the lady moved out from between them and walked away . the guard with the sword , who was not wearing a sword or shield , stared at the lady for a moment before letting go of the sword
[821/1000]	the night had n't ended with a beating heart and shattered ribs . after his father 's funeral , he 'd left , hoping to make up for his sins in the way he 'd been punished in the past
[822/1000]	" he 'll be fine , " i murmured , my eyes on the ground . " he just needs some time . " " maybe he should have a doctor here so he can learn to function .
[823/1000]	chapter 12 nick was in this office , alone , all alone . no one was here , and nothing was moving . there was no one to bother nick . " nick ? " a male voice
[824/1000]	" i did n't say i was going to help you . " " you do n't have to try to use what you feel to convince me . i know you ca n't . " " this
[825/1000]	" really ? " i said . i tried to keep my voice gentle , like i had no idea what he was talking about . " maybe i have n't thought that far ahead . " but that was
[826/1000]	" are you sure ? " cole nodded . " my guess is that they 're just as willing to keep you safe , too . you were definitely the reason they followed us to the observatory . what
[827/1000]	" that was nice , " i told her , smiling . " yeah , it was , " she said , her teeth snapping together in a frown . " you do n't look so good .
[828/1000]	" yes , i told you i can . because i 'm sure this one and then so will the other one . " " damn . you came in here in a kilt . " she stared him
[829/1000]	" he does n't want me with you , " i protested weakly as it started to make sense that he might not want to keep me a while longer . " i was n't asking you to .
[830/1000]	" i did not care to sit in front of you in any case , so when my friend saw you in the hall and remembered the time you left the house - except when you were in the park
[831/1000]	" have n't we seen enough , " he said , taking my arm and leading me down the hall to the back of the boat , which served as the infirmary . " come help me sort something out
[832/1000]	" what time is it ? " " almost five . you must go here then , now . " " i have n't done anything wrong . " " do it . " chapter 14
[833/1000]	" he should be here any second , " mom said as she and sarah moved out of the kitchen . " was the sheriff at the house when i went to the door ? " " no
[834/1000]	" now let me drive you home . i 've been riding around with my mouth open , salivating like a dog . " " you 're crazy , " she says . i get up in my seat
[835/1000]	" because you put a lot of trust in them ? " she asked . the woman shrugged . " i let them in when they asked me to . " " that was a mistake , "
[836/1000]	" no , she 's not . she 's very good . " again the tone of his voice . " you do know this is a stupid question , do n't you ? " yeah , they
[837/1000]	she looked into my eyes . " do n't tell me , i 'm an idiot for not realizing it earlier . " she nodded and then started walking . " follow me . i 'll lead the way .
[838/1000]	she felt his presence behind her . his scent invaded her senses , invading hers in a heady flood . " the woman i promised to marry was a fraud and my sister was innocent . with her it
[839/1000]	" of course , " he said . " i wanted to make sure you were all right . " " i 'm fine , " she said . " but you 'd have been even more furious
[840/1000]	but even as he did , he wondered when he 'd stop making excuses to be a father . that was the way he lived his life until now . with regret ringing in his ears , he
[841/1000]	" yes , " i said and he nodded . " i 'm sure you 'll be pleased . " he did n't get it . " what ? " " nothing , " i muttered and
[842/1000]	the woman did n't speak , no , instead she placed a hand on the table . " be careful . " " you too . " i left her to face the new reality of her situation
[843/1000]	if not for the fact that the two of you worked together and he was clearly a far more accomplished man , i never would have believed you . i admire your courage in this , skyler , but do
[844/1000]	" have some bloody eggs ! you damned - " the voice broke off and she broke off again . the scream that came out of its mouth seemed guttural , like something from a nightmare , not from any
[845/1000]	then with a quick glance to his right the men in the crowd started screaming . as a wave of wind slammed into him , ryan stumbled against something . he turned his head , looking up to see
[846/1000]	" not us , " i say . " i know i 'm going to be stuck here another two years , and that i 'll miss the old neighborhood . " " no , " she says .
[847/1000]	" i do n't believe i won , " she murmured innocently . " but i enjoyed you , too . " it struck him as odd that she would say that as if it were yet another one
[848/1000]	i rolled my eyes . " what ? everybody makes it , babe . " i pulled her in for a hug . " i 'll see you inside . " " you sure ? " she pulled back
[849/1000]	" if that was true before , then why did n't the soldiers find it ? " " maybe they thought the armor was a fake , " denth said . " like we all do . "
[850/1000]	he turned his light on the other side of me . " for one thing , i wo n't get caught . " i chuckled , pointing to the two of us with the flashlight . " you better
[851/1000]	" i know , my dear ; i have my own opinions and opinions - for the sake of the children . do n't interrupt me when i think this , " said ber na dette . she began
[852/1000]	only a tiny crack , barely noticeable in the sunlight through the window . i know it will only be minutes , but the sun feels like it can move with the wind from a million miles away .
[853/1000]	but i do n't want to talk about it . this is n't good for us . it can ruin us and everything else . when i get out of the shower , i make myself an apple and
[854/1000]	i 'm so thankful he did n't break his promise . he would make me wait like that for another night . until i thought what a bad idea this was and i could do nothing but give in .
[855/1000]	" you are so stupid you did n't want to know . " " how do you find him ? " " he does n't give up . my word is law . " no . my
[856/1000]	she lifted the blade of her knife . she watched as it came within inches of her forearm . blood erupted from her body on the knife 's edge . it seemed to shimmer as it flickered around her
[857/1000]	" we just did , " i said nonchalantly . " we get the flu to the press . ca n't have a name leaked . " one side of his mouth tipped up . " right . "
[858/1000]	she swallowed hard , but there was nothing else she could do . she sat down and put her sandwich down to be sure it would stay empty . then she sighed and pulled her knees up to her chest
[859/1000]	" all right . " i shrugged him off , giving him his privacy . " but they already had the same problem as me . " " yeah , well . not as bad as me . "
[860/1000]	i had to smile at the thought . the woman sounded like a spoiled little country bu mp kin , and what had mr. parker said ? it 'll be great for you to look like a witch with a
[861/1000]	this last thought was echoed on the other side of the door . another set of footsteps was brought back . it was someone who had been on the other side . there was a little sound
[862/1000]	" they can read my mind . i can see it in their eyes . " " oh , that , " she said , nodding . " then why do they act like - " " do
[863/1000]	" get me a water then . " he shook his head . " you 'd rather be locked up , would n't you ? " " yes . " she dropped her eyes to the floor .
[864/1000]	" you 're the one bringing up money . " " in my business a lot goes to make money on occasion . my dad is a big shot in denver . it 's his town . "
[865/1000]	" what are you doing ? " " thinking . i did n't know i was so messed up before . " " you 're not out of it ? " " no . we 've been
[866/1000]	after working so hard , i was now satisfied . i turned and walked out to my car . i drove to the hotel , thinking , ' i need to do this because i do n't want any responsibility
[867/1000]	they were all waiting for this . i felt sick and i could n't tell who was shaking . my mother 's smile and the warmth in her eyes . i felt someone shake my shoulders , and i
[868/1000]	" so , what are they going to do about it ? " i asked . " probably throw it in the ocean . it could take some time for them to get organized , but for now ,
[869/1000]	" here is your key . " emma peered into the peephole , still holding onto the handle . " who is it ? " " jack . i 'm just here to help . " "
[870/1000]	" i did n't ask you to be my advisor , but we needed a way to do it . i 've done it to help her and i know what she needs from the hospital , i just need
[871/1000]	" it 's not a matter of doing things myself , " he said , leaning across the chair and laying his hand on my knee . " i went to the library , " he said , meeting my
[872/1000]	from below , he <EOS> said , " <EOS> the sun is not a killer your eyes will grow to you will never fully i shall fill the hollow of your heart the sun is
[873/1000]	" yes , " he answered reluctantly . " it is . there was this terrible fire on friday night , and it could not wait , so we made camp the next day and burned down our barn .
[874/1000]	slowly , my face cleared and i slowly began to remove one article at a time . i lifted my shirt over my head , but they were still attached to my chest . i stepped out of my pants
[875/1000]	the man nodded and went on to explain , " the land and men are in a state of constant motion . the most dangerous of these is when it 's a big one , ' specially when the majority
[876/1000]	" what exactly do you know about that ? " he demanded . " what are you a cop for , i wonder ? " " i was n't trained to handle situations like this , " said judd
[877/1000]	" where i 'm going next , i 'm going to put my fingers in her mouth . " " and then when she 's like this , you 're going to take her clit . " "
[878/1000]	" why have you not gone with them ? " " they have orders , " li erva said , with a wry smirk , returning to the living room . " and if we stay , we 'll
[879/1000]	" we found a new friend . " i sighed and looked forward to a meal at the resort where i would meet my new friends there . " go on . " " they are a bit
[880/1000]	" please . there are n't any bars , you 're here by yourself . let 's go out . wait for me ... do not wait . " he said . he took his head out from under his
[881/1000]	i could feel her smile ; of course , she was playing dumb . " um huh . " i laughed . then i frowned . i looked down at her shoulder and then up at her face .
[882/1000]	he had his head down , like he had been in pain for only a moment , and continued to speak without meeting my eyes . " there were three of us . one of us was the oldest .
[883/1000]	" sure . i 'll go get you a beer . " " thanks , i 'll just wait here . " " okay . i 'll eat lunch while you 're gone . " the next
[884/1000]	he had never believed things could be this hard . he 'd never expected himself to stand the way he did . he 'd seen them all , seen himself fighting the men he 'd killed , seen the helpless
[885/1000]	" what are you getting comfortable with ? " i ask as i reach out and flip up the front of his shirt , the hem and upper half of his pants . he lets out a shaky breath
[886/1000]	to say that he knew just how incredibly pleasurable it was to have the woman at his mercy had a vague , un helpful conno tation . even so , the whole experience was delicious and it made him mad
[887/1000]	" good . let 's take something from the box . that way it is n't locked back up if mrs. parker snee zes or something . " " what ? not on your life . " "
[888/1000]	" your wish is my command , " the sergeant replied with satisfaction , and then he pointed to the ground in the centre of the field . " what ? " galeren exclaimed incredulously , " why did
[889/1000]	' now we make the rest of the journey with the utmost speed . we do n't need the horses ' luck to go on forever . ' just then , the caravan came to a halt . she
[890/1000]	" do n't worry , they 'll get over it . " " why ? it came as something of a surprise . " " trust me . they 'll figure out what 's going on first .
[891/1000]	" i doubt it , " ty grunted . when ty did n't budge , pruett knew he was n't going to budge . ty mcin tyre did n't like being told what he wanted to do .
[892/1000]	" there 's no escape , " she said . her voice trembled . " i 'm not going to survive if you destroy it just because you want to control me . " " if you say so
[893/1000]	' yes . i guess you 're right . ' ' the girls say he 's got a beard .... ' ' look , ' she said , rising , ' i 've got to run . it
[894/1000]	" like you have n't had enough of me ? " " no . you do n't have to put it that way . you ca n't take a woman 's virginity without the ability to make it happen
[895/1000]	" there are n't any other doors in the house . " " the one at the top ? " " they 're locked . i 'm sure someone else owns them . " " okay .
[896/1000]	she could n't help it . she leaned in and gave him a big kiss that blew him off balance . her moist lips slid against his , and she had just a brief taste of her own tongue and
[897/1000]	" come on . no more talking , " he said . " you get back to work . " we were both working on the remaining pieces of the chessboard when he said , " you 're crazy
[898/1000]	he nodded , still staring straight ahead . " i always think about someone just when i 'm worried about them . " with the moment in hand , and a little later , she climbed into the shower
[899/1000]	" i know it 's early but i think we can use some help with the inventory , " i reasoned . i turned around , found everyone looking at a printout of the shipment of weapons . i
[900/1000]	" no problem . my name 's jason , " he said with a heavy accent . she tried to smile as he reached out for her hand . she was nervous . his hand was warm . his
[901/1000]	i did n't need a doctor and did n't think i 'd be able to make the appointment . just then , my phone rang , and i did n't think much of it until i found noah 's number
[902/1000]	" not so many , now , miss . " " how many of them were there before ? " he seemed to ponder a question . " the first few , " he said . "
[903/1000]	" i have some good news , " she said , giving him a broad grin . " i 've got some great news as well . " " what ? " she went on . " it
[904/1000]	a sudden wave of darkness slid over me , threatening to pull me under . i blinked and blinked again , and a familiar voice , " hey ! do you have a light in here ? " "
[905/1000]	the little red - haired woman jumped down off the mule and walked over to me . she raised her hand as my eyes widened , and pointed to herself in a way that showed me just how small she
[906/1000]	" no ! all i wanted was to go home and have a change of clothes . " i walked out of the kitchen with my brother in tow . " i still have the dress . we can
[907/1000]	i stood in front of him . " you owe me . " he pointed to his chest and said , " what does it matter ? i 'm still a good - looking guy , remember ? "
[908/1000]	" no . " " yes , yes , " he sneered . " you promised to be good . you promised . and you lied . you were going to lie to cover your ass . whatever game
[909/1000]	" if you want to be alone , i have every right to ask you for advice about leaving . like you do something stupid when you 're stressed . " he nodded , accepting her decision to go
[910/1000]	he could n't stand to see her hurt in any way . she was their daughter and it tore him up inside . he hated the fact he had n't been there for her . " what are you
[911/1000]	" god , it was cold , " i said , but before i could add more , he laughed . " did you enjoy playing basketball at school ? " " no ! " i said defensively .
[912/1000]	" i do n't know how you even know what that is ! " he said . " the only people i 've ever seen who were smart enough to build a house like this do n't have a clue
[913/1000]	it was nice to know that my life was still good . " hello , detective carver . " " hi ma'am . is everything alright ? it 's been at least a while since you have been
[914/1000]	" i am all business before lunch , this morning . " my heart swelled with appreciation . " have fun then . " he dropped the phone , grabbed the small bag of clothes from his desk
[915/1000]	" i bet your mom would n't let you drink so much beer . ' course if you were n't careful , you 'd drown yourself with it . " " it 's just a drink . c'mon man
[916/1000]	" i will , but a minute of that would give me something to do . i think i am going to pop in to see what you are up to . " she let out another soft whine
[917/1000]	" and the point ? " " okay i 'll say it : the night i had you . " " i was n't aware that the night was a night . " " i was n't
[918/1000]	the night fell quickly on the river between the two towns , and the temperature dropped by an additional four degrees . the sun was nearing its lowest point when the river started its slow swim , and a gentle
[919/1000]	i did n't want to do anything just yet . was it safer if he were to stick with the story ? unless he liked the ' i 'm here to ' version of it , no matter what ,
[920/1000]	" yeah , you should write about that , too , " he says . " i suppose i will . " " what was the name of that man who came from the old man 's house
[921/1000]	' i understand , ' the lawyer agreed , nodding . ' i 'll deal with that . i have it and , quite frankly , it 's important . ' ' then what are we waiting for ,
[922/1000]	" no . " this time she turned to me and my stomach turned . i was so not getting any answers about this . we were being watched , and i needed a reprieve . i was sick
[923/1000]	" you have n't forgotten , " he said . " how i killed her on the field . " he stepped back , into the shadows of the stairwell , and i followed , holding my breath .
[924/1000]	he saw her flinch and closed his eyes . " baby , i am so proud of you . " " yeah , yeah , cut the shit , " she muttered to herself . " well then
[925/1000]	my heart was hammering , all of the blood in my system rushing to a million directions . " thanks , man . want to come ? " he chuckled at my remark and shook his head . "
[926/1000]	we said goodbye to mrs. davis and drove slowly back to my apartment . soon , we were lying on my couch snuggled close and talking about all the things that would ever happen between us . everything will
[927/1000]	" i did tell you she already came , " i said . " how long have you known ? " said the vampire . " you were her doctor in the old days , the one she cared
[928/1000]	the air in the room had shifted subtly , like the breeze might have suddenly shifted like a door had been closed . " what 's going on ? " asked the doctor after a few moments . "
[929/1000]	no further thought was necessary as he found his gaze caught some sight of his father and father - in - law . he gave an exasperated sound and turned to stare , though the scene in front of him
[930/1000]	" i 'm at a loss , captain . what are you ? " " well , the same thing i 've been since your departure . i 'm trying to find you and what a wonderful job you
[931/1000]	" thank goodness for that ! " she sighed . " now for the real question . for so long everyone thinks that this is a game . who is going to win ? " antonia laughed , glad
[932/1000]	" she came back to america , " i said , trying to sound casual . " no shit , " he said , with a sense of shock . " for the three days before your two -
[933/1000]	' then let 's get out of it this minute . ' nick went outside and climbed the fence to the top and climbed over the wall , then jumped , hitting the ground running . he ran into

[935/1000]	" god , you 're right . i ca n't believe how many kids were born in the last twenty - four hours ! maybe none of us , just us .... " he lifted her head and stared at
[936/1000]	the nurse moved back into the room and took the wheel seat . " that 's a lucky break , " kelly said . " even a three - month pregnant woman knows that she can bleed to death
[937/1000]	" no reason to . no matter where she is i ca n't help but think that i want her back . never mind if you just found her or not . i know your history , now try to
[938/1000]	he does n't know how to react to that , not with his parents staring at him like that , all parental panic and desperation and , yes , denial , but it 's a relief to see it starting
[939/1000]	" that 's nice , but i do n't think so . " she sat on the couch opposite him and said , " is that why you brought me here , to ask me out ? "
[940/1000]	he did n't fight it . " i have to go back there , but i wo n't be back here until you tell me what 's going on . " she took a deep breath , then turned
[941/1000]	" i did n't expect you to . " one hand went to his throat , where his blade had been embedded . i drew back and shook my head . " i know you did n't . but
[942/1000]	" so are you . what about your dad ? " i asked him . he shrugged . " i ca n't say . he , ah , did n't see the point in me going <EOS> <EOS> kind
[943/1000]	" no , no , you do n't . this is a special assignment for me . if you need help it will be from me . " he paused , his eyes focused on me , even while he
[944/1000]	i let the air out of my lungs and stood there , staring at my surroundings . we were in a small , dingy room that was full of people , all of whom were on their knees , praying
[945/1000]	the man named roger did n't need another lie - he knew . the moment he spoke to the child , however , he felt an invisible surge of energy surge through the family , all of them , a
[946/1000]	there was no reason for him to stop , and she could hear the regret in his tone . if only she 'd listened to him harder , she would have known enough about his feelings and her own to
[947/1000]	" you have to let me handle this , " he insisted . " what can you possibly do ? " she countered , her voice rising but finding no other source of strength than her own .
[948/1000]	" you two make each other happy , " said jill . " but i would n't go calling it happy . it 's crazy . i 'm not sure it even exists . to you it seems impossible .
[949/1000]	" we ... it 's all right . i ... i forgot to tell you that i took the test ... but your name is ... " " ... what did you say ? " " the name
[950/1000]	" your sister is my best friend , not my family , " i said slowly , understanding . " i do n't think . but you 've been a good friend to her <EOS> and i hope that makes
[951/1000]	and then there was her , but he did n't want to think about her . he had to face this woman and decide what was best for him . at the time , he 'd known she
[952/1000]	" but he 's been murdered ! someone at the crime scene will be calling it in , seeing him murdered ! " " is n't he ? " detective jack said . " how do you know ?
[953/1000]	" yes , " the dowager answered . " but you ca n't imagine our outrage . a young woman with magic or someone that age - " " she 's more like the governess that you thought she
[954/1000]	" who are you ? " " i 'm a detective , and i 'm going to ask you a strange question . " his tone turned steely , and rage boiled over . " what is that
[955/1000]	there was a moment of silence as the entire city fell silent . " then how are we gon na do it ? " asked one of the men from the audience . " i know ! "
[956/1000]	" hi , " i said nervously , smiling sheepishly , not wanting to embarrass myself and giving him my best innocent smile . " hi back ! " he said , letting go of my wrist .
[957/1000]	when we arrived back at the penthouse , constantijin was going to have to let me use the bathroom because of dinner . he led me by the hand out , his expression serious right before he shut the door
[958/1000]	i 've lost all sense of time having passed since i left her . i think about the time the plane dropped me off . it was to visit my mother , right after i left aunt letty and i
[959/1000]	but when her attention shifted away it was on the clock . time to go to work . ~ * ~ " so , where will we be working this week ? " " i do n't
[960/1000]	" sure , " she agrees , with a cheeky little grin . we walk around the edge of the large meadow to where she 's standing . she reaches up to touch the brim of her goggles , and
[961/1000]	" i will , " he assured her . " i 'm glad you 're here . i ... i'm glad you were here when i needed you . " " i 'm glad , too , " she
[962/1000]	' you 've heard of john doe 's death ? ' asked the sergeant . jack nodded . ' well that 's what everyone 's been talking about . it 's still believed , but rumours are n't going to
[963/1000]	" it 's not too late . " i tell her fiercely . a tear trickles down my face and i ca n't tell if it 's for me or myself because i 've never been so wrong before .
[964/1000]	" when the boy died , " the old man replied , " the blood ran cold in my veins . this was at night , and the moon was full , and it was n't long before i began
[965/1000]	" no . this is all coming together so far , but it 's hard for me to do a thing . there 's no going back from here . " i think all six of my brothers would talk
[966/1000]	" you did n't do this , " she said , looking at me with so much anger on her face that my heart felt crushed . i shook my head . " you 're wrong . i should
[967/1000]	in her mind she saw herself as she had long ago been - as she was now looking upon herself . " i can be quite forceful in my opinions , i can too , but it can not be
[968/1000]	" then there 's no reason to stop in town . " there 's no reason to stop . my stomach flips and does a cart wheel . " there are a few reasons you could be right .
[969/1000]	" so this girl - was it ... a ... twin ? " i swallowed and then asked , " are you really taking the piss ? do you like women <EOS> a lot ? " he shrugged
[970/1000]	" that , perhaps , is true as well , but i assure you that you must remember that we 're the only ones to leave this room . " " wait , can i have it again ?
[971/1000]	" hey , there . " " it 's about time you got in here . " " i got in here a little early , " he said , " since your brother - in - law
[972/1000]	" who is it ? " asked rose in a trembling voice . " the man from inside the book , " said roger . " he 's back . " chapter two " where are we
[973/1000]	" who 's that ? " said jane . " it 's the ' captain ' 's boy . " " i thought . . . " " i know , " said clayton . " he
[974/1000]	from the kitchen someone shouted for them to check the microwave . after a moment and a muffled hum , the door opened . the room was lit by several flickering gas gas bulbs . as the darkness became
[975/1000]	only now , it was n't only the woman with a bag full of groceries coming down the steps and toward the restaurant , it was the entire town . and that was pretty much where everyone was now .
[976/1000]	" they caught us eating out of the bag ! " " when we fell asleep at the airport , " he said , " we heard them . were n't any of you awake ? " "
[977/1000]	before he could come up with an explanation , she went on . " i 'm sure you 'll understand that we do n't want them to know we 're here . " " i understand . i promise
[978/1000]	my head hurt and my vision was fading , but i did n't care . i needed to stop my tears . what happened ? i was n't able to remember anything <EOS> all the fun things that my mom
[979/1000]	i 'm pretty sure that makes her even more nervous , because with no reason to think , i reach out and touch her hair . " are you nervous ? " she takes a deep breath and nods
[980/1000]	i said , " okay then . ' " i added , " it may not be a very big deal , because it is not a single thing to be publi ci zed . also , i want to
[981/1000]	" do n't do this , " the demon hissed a warning in his head as styx moved forward , fully intent on taking him down . he would kill him with one of his own bullets ... or
[982/1000]	i saw them , and could almost - barely - believe it . they were walking through the jungle toward us , their trunks the color of ripe peaches . here they seemed to be drawn as much toward
[983/1000]	she looked around as if seeing something new - a memory from a long time ago . " please say thank you , " she said . " i was frightened . " the angel , <EOS> then
[984/1000]	he rolled out of bed and came and stood over me . " we could be friends . " my heart dropped to the pit of my stomach . it was bad enough that he 'd say that
[985/1000]	was n't it a pretty horrible turn of events ? he 'd looked so scared ... and now she could n't seem to stop the tears . did they always do that in the mornings ? did he have
[986/1000]	i can almost hear his mind churning with the wisdom of this revelation . and i suddenly know why . the reason i let calder fall to his knees . the reason i allow him to make me feel
[987/1000]	" my pleasure . i had a really stressful day and thought i would n't get much sleep . " that was n't all i thought he would get . i decided to push him . " are
[988/1000]	" i want to hurt him ! " i yelled at her . " you ca n't do this ! " she put her hands up . " he loves you ; he is just dealing with his pain
[989/1000]	i sighed and sat down on the love seat . " i wish i had your skills , but i 've been very busy . " she wrapped her arms around me and kept talking in my ear while
[990/1000]	" please , " i say meekly , remembering the last time a man grabbed me . something about his eyes is so completely threatening i consider turning around . in fact , i decide i 've seen him
[991/1000]	" well this is about as dangerous as it gets . " dr. turner turned to look into the crowd and noticed two humans . he made a gesture and two guards pushed past him and walked directly to the
[992/1000]	a chill went down her spine as she remembered waking up in that house with him on the couch looking angry . the night before they 'd had sex . afterward . he 'd shoved her away . she 'd
[993/1000]	i 'm worried that a stray bullet will do serious damage . " the fbi had promised me that you 'd have this location covered from the very beginning . " <EOS> the fbi had decided to make sure that
[994/1000]	" you 're talking to me about taking her over to your house and giving her a good home ? " " i 'd say she 's having a good time , " dad says , but i already
[995/1000]	" no , it 's not the right time . " " it 's early . " " is it ? " he asked , " i mean , it does n't seem as if - "
[996/1000]	" it 's one thing to enjoy my company . but we can be at ease with each other just because we 're in the room together , " i said , a bit sarcastically . " i might
[997/1000]	i could n't speak , could only clutch the reins . i 'm sorry , sweet . but i ca n't find this place anymore . this was your dream . do n't ask me to come without
[998/1000]	" your guess is as good as mine , hon . " the sound of his laughter and her small intake of breath only added to the fact that he was watching her . even when she was feeling
[999/1000]	" okay , here you go , " he said cheerfully . " here is your breakfast , " he said , holding the plate out to her . " we can give you some time to figure out your
