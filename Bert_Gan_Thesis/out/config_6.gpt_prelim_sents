[7/1000]	i would also like to assure you that i am not just going through my daily routine for some reason or another . i do n't think i am addicted on purpose , " i answered with a little smile
[8/1000]	you could say that again , he thought , with a quick , wry grin . they passed through one of the main doors and turned onto the south lawn . there were two cars in the drive .
[9/1000]	no one else could get close enough to reach her for comfort . " you do n't have to like him if you do n't want to , " her mother said . " i just wish you could
[10/1000]	" this better not be a joke . " i glared at him . " no shit . " he grinned up at me . " but i 'll play along . " " you 're too cocky

[16/1000]	the answer came a second later . " what does that mean ? ! " chapter 5 . the interview with mr. barn dale mr. stewart was seated at his desk in an opening . " mr. barn
[17/1000]	" i thought we were supposed to be hanging out with each other , " i blurted just as the doorbell rang . i looked up from my computer program to see three girls with short black hair and
[18/1000]	the girl 's gaze flickered from one to the other before she mumbled , " yes . she 's dying . " her words were like a hammer slamming into his gut , crushing , paralyzing the breath and
[19/1000]	" if you wo n't allow me to see charlie , i 'll leave you alone . " i pushed past him and stormed out of the room . i had no intention of letting him get away with

[27/1000]	the door came up and i saw mr. ho ffer who had been talking with him a few minutes earlier , and then he looked at me and said , " yes ? " in that voice that made it

[31/1000]	" i 'll go get my drink , " i said , stepping out of the car . once i was standing under the overhang , i quickly dialed my father 's home number . " hello ? "
[32/1000]	' the people of england ! ' i shouted in mock defiance . we both sat staring across the table , at a table we had had tea in . ' oh , no ! ' her mouth
[33/1000]	" i 'll be in touch . " i had almost given up though . i just kept thinking about the thing with hunter . did he want more to happen between us ? was there further conflict ,
[34/1000]	" do you ? " i asked . " i do . " he reached for my hand and helped me to my feet . he brought it to his mouth and brushed a kiss down my knuckles one
[35/1000]	" i 'm just going to get up <EOS> and get into his pants . " " in a movie , i want to find my place in the book . then i 'll look around . do it
[36/1000]	" i see you and the lovely wife have met . " with that , it was all over . it was with the ease , without fuss , of a well - adjusted husband . even after a
[37/1000]	" i 'm not a ... " she paused as he stood from his chair and walked to her side . his hands slid around her , and he pulled her tightly against him . " you do have a
[38/1000]	" why not ? " she asked . " everybody else is too busy trying to prove something or other to the other . " " so you have enough time alone , " he said . " or
[39/1000]	" with what ? " " a knife and a gun . " he nodded , but nodded so sharply it seemed as if he were staring directly into my eyes . " oh ... " i

[41/1000]	" you 're the girl from the picture you hid behind the window , " daniel said . " that 's me - always just the girl , and now this ! " she gestured around them . "
[42/1000]	" you are very beautiful . " i smiled shyly and blushed . " thank you . " i said , simply . " so where is your car ? the sun is going to be out in a few
[43/1000]	the last one spoke up from the corner . " we want out of here . " " of course , " said k ress . " it 's past her bedtime . " and though the two seemed
[44/1000]	" well , i guess we could have been wrong , but with you in the game , that can mean only one thing . he wanted power again . " " and you did n't take it .
[45/1000]	" all right , all right , " he said in a soft voice that still vibrated with lust , still whispered in my ear . he pressed his lips to the nape of my neck , making me shiver
[46/1000]	she looked at him pleadingly . " please . " he grinned . well , " beg " he could do . " get in my bed . " she did n't resist . he was good at
[47/1000]	to be truly sure , we should call for an immediate search of her house , for i hope she remembers , and with an effort at some small peace i 'll stop myself from speaking of this to anyone

[50/1000]	the music was cut off by music again , and the conductor seemed to feel he 'd established his position on the orchestra . however , at one point , a couple from the bar came up and began to

[53/1000]	i try not to be angry , but then again i was angry earlier . i 'm sick to death of wanting people to die because they can still feel their emotions when they die . that 's a mistake
[54/1000]	she did n't respond . i got up and i joined her in the kitchen . my stomach growled like hell , and i remembered how much that had eaten at a normal person . i cleared my throat
[55/1000]	but i was thinking of a whole lot more than my clothes . i was thinking of something else . something far more potent . something i did n't even know the meaning of . chapter twenty -
[56/1000]	" we are n't coming near the prison , mother . " the one called ra jak answered . " we are headed to the forest , not to the place called the sanctuary . " " good .

[58/1000]	the captain 's attention was diverted , but he was not paying them the slightest attention . he was looking at the woman again , the one he 'd been looking for . my face started to stiffen as she

[65/1000]	in spite of that , she did n't think about it , only continued onward . god love her , but she hated that she 'd just had the conversation with herself and that she was thinking about it
[66/1000]	" i have to go back down there , see if i can convince him to leave me alone . i 'm at some kind of an impasse . " " oh ! what 's happened ? "
[67/1000]	he had a place . he had a stable where they could move from town to town . he had a small ranch out there . he had money . he had a car he could drive and he had
[68/1000]	" as you wish . " " thank you for all the help . tomorrow i 'd like to tell all the children about your plan . can you get them ready ? " he 'd asked everyone .
[69/1000]	" yes , the women left shortly after the storm . " " thank you , captain , " i say . " and is it true that you 've been seen just disappearing over the crest of the
[70/1000]	just in time , too . the train was pulling up to the station . " no worries . " i waved goodbye as i stepped down the steps . what kind of crazy act was that ?
[71/1000]	" it works when your mind is busy , huh ? " " pretty much , " she smiled . " anyway , we talked a minute ago . " " and ? " " i asked
[72/1000]	" well , maybe it 's best if he just left you alone for a few days until we can figure out what to do with him . the whole thing is a huge mess . " " he
[73/1000]	" you want me to do it ? " she asked , staring at his face and hoping he 'd lose his guard . she would n't let herself get hurt again by him . " yes . "
[74/1000]	" yes ... yes , that is right . " i breathed out , trying to shake everything out . " you did just tell me you were going to give up your freedom . " " no
[75/1000]	" i hope so . how long have you been back in town ? " " i was in a bit of a hurry to be back , really . something i 'd rather take the time for .
[76/1000]	" there 's no need for you to give him away . i know this man , and i know he meant nothing to me . " " how do you mean ? " " you 're a
[77/1000]	" oh , fuck her . no . " the word exploded from him . " no , i 'm not getting married . no . okay , no . " there was a long silence . "
[78/1000]	" i 'm going to be late . do you mind if i just pop down a couple of minutes ? " i asked . " no . not at all . " as soon as i got
[79/1000]	i heard the sound of waves rushing over rocks nearby and the sudden jolt of vertigo hit me . i held onto the rail and wondered if the tide was coming . " you all right , kid ?
[80/1000]	" no , " she said briskly . she pushed away from the counter . he still loomed over her . the intensity of his stare singed her . she gasped . " no , " she begged again
[81/1000]	" but that is n't enough . " " hey , i 'm just the guy you can use to get to the top . besides , does anyone else mind ? " " i think not .
[82/1000]	he dropped her hands , holding them in place . " you could n't bring yourself to tell me the truth about that , could you ? " she shook her head and continued at a more normal pace
[83/1000]	" okay , " i whispered . then i put my ear to his chest , listened to his heart slow down and listened to him get even later . i held on tight because i did n't
[84/1000]	and although her reaction did n't entirely reassure him , that was n't why he had n't let her go . maybe if they had a long evening in private the matter could be concluded in bed . "
[85/1000]	" i feel like i live in a fairy princess world . " gabriel laughed and it was n't like he gave a damn about that . " i do n't . at all . " it was
[86/1000]	" you 're dead . " " go , " he said . " run . " i crossed my arms . i was tired , but being mad at curran meant my job , where i could

[88/1000]	they drove for a while , and david was talking . kate looked out the window , listening intently . she 'd lived in new york for the last eighteen years and had never met a city quite like it
[89/1000]	" what about the other stuff from your mother ? " his question interrupted my train of thought . we walked quietly back to the house . he was silent until he was inside and we entered the house .
[90/1000]	" you saw what happened to mom and dad , " i whispered . " so you know how weak they really are . " i felt him cringe . " do n't be so sure , little sister
[91/1000]	" you were saying ? " " do n't worry , " he said with a grin . " good . " i sighed as i reached for my cigarettes . " are n't you going to
[92/1000]	" you 're in deep , girl , " he said as he sat down beside her . they ordered a variety of food and the waitress came back with their drinks . after a few sips off the
[93/1000]	while i was there , i was forced to explain to them what had happened the night before : the night before , when i had let the black man get away with a kiss , and also yesterday ,
[94/1000]	" good night , " he said . as he slid out of the seat . he did n't bother to shut the door . the day fell into a slow , steady routine of being knocked on the

[104/1000]	" good night , ben . " * * * i 'd only been in bed about five minutes when something shifted and threw me to the side . so i sat up , my hand coming into

[109/1000]	she was a little late coming back . a girl to get cleaned up . all her hair to set off the butterflies in her stomach . the idea of having a man as good as cole made her nervous
[110/1000]	he took the bag of food out of the back of the pickup . handing it to her , he said , " this is my treat before i go . " " oh . " olivia turned around
[111/1000]	" hey , if you want to stay over later ... " " do n't you dare ! " she said , letting out a scream and trying to run . then , to my surprise , she
[112/1000]	" the first time you went looking for that box of tricks that <EOS> in the garage , i took care of that . for at least the one to the first thing . " " would you say
[113/1000]	it must have hurt . she 'd finally given in and finally gone on a date with michael , but she 'd agreed to let him bring her dinner , still holding onto his arm , all the while secretly
[114/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " he said once i had settled . " you know , when you walked into the room an hour ago . " he was looking me over just like it was probably a
[115/1000]	the rest of the day passed in a blur for me . it was then that i realized where i was . i could not say which side of the room he was standing on . it was actually more
[116/1000]	" what happened ? " " a group of kids were with them and stopped them . they were all stabbed ; not with stakes . one guy was sitting on top of one of them , and he
[117/1000]	he reached a crossroads in front of him . the lane ran west toward the river bank . " are you going to be ok , " i asked him . he patted my shoulder and kept walking
[118/1000]	he nodded . " there 's one last thing , " i said . after a moment of hesitation , he nodded " go ahead and take my car back . " he smiled as he stood up
[119/1000]	they were staring at each other , she was all nervous , he was all heated , and she was confused on the inside . she would never have thought anything would happen to her , but they knew it
[120/1000]	" why ? " the elevator doors opened . " because . " he pulled me harder against his body . " this way . " * * * " we have to hurry . "
[121/1000]	" but first , i must meet my son . my sweet , he is coming soon . " it took him a moment to get the words out , and then he gave a laugh softly . "
[122/1000]	i laugh and push him hard . " you have to be my hero , you know . " he closes the distance between us so fast i lose mine and fall lightly into his arms . he scoops
[123/1000]	he made an effort to move past her , to his room , but she shoved his hand away and held up her hands as if warding him off . " we ca n't have that , lucien ,
[124/1000]	" look at me , " reacher said . she moved her eyes . reacher tilted them . " is this how they did it when the fbi went postal over alice 's disappearance ? did they sit
[125/1000]	he sat cross - legged on the sand across from me . " my mother was a farmer . she was a good woman . she owned a house , but i was content . to have someone in my

[129/1000]	" good . " i was happy that we were finally taking on some kind of a family thing . i had to do what seemed like every task i sent her - making sure she went to sleep .
[130/1000]	he came over and pulled his hand through my hair , lifting it so he could kiss my forehead , then his lips skimmed my cheekbone . " this is good , baby , but do n't let this
[131/1000]	and then my phone rang , and i jumped . i turned it off instantly , then glanced at it for a second . my heart had stopped . had to . it was the sheriff . he
[132/1000]	" i ca n't , " he whispered . " she has n't told anyone about us , and i ca n't take any chances any more . " she slid off the counter and put her palms flat
[133/1000]	" all right , let 's head back to the island . it 's only a few hours ' walk . we 'll find a place to hole up and sleep . you get some sleep , too . "
[134/1000]	he paused before adding : " but the plan is n't all good . " * * * " where is it , " she asked as she felt her voice break for the first time . "

[137/1000]	their gaze locked for a long moment , and grace 's breath was caught in her throat . had he sensed her hesitation ? just where did he think he was going , crossing paths with a man who

[141/1000]	she rolled her eyes again , " this all makes complete sense - the dream of the great white wolf , the hunt , the secret weapons , and the whole damned night . " she looked directly into my

[147/1000]	that 's right , she thought . i was a stupid teenager by my own admission . " what ? " he demanded . " nothing . " she smoothed the lapels of her navy sundress . "
[148/1000]	" hey ! why are you wearing your panties in this weather ? " alex hissed from behind me , startling a piece off my pants . " um , no reason . " i held up my fingers
[149/1000]	' no . you want to go with me , ' she tells me , ' but you 've got to understand that my plans are never what they seem . nothing , not even my plans , can reach

[151/1000]	he looked puzzled for a moment . " that 's not how he talked about the people in the company , is it ? " " no , " i answered , not looking at him . "

[158/1000]	we talked for a few more minutes , until the clock radio on the desk sounded a little too loud . the music faded into the background , a haunting tune i only heard on the radio every now and
[159/1000]	the elevator doors opened when he was about to close them . he stopped and turned . " you 've got it all wrong . " a heavy cloud of cigar smoke mixed with a hint of sweat emanated from
[160/1000]	he slid open the box and felt around the interior of its lining . another button . he found a flat panel , with a remote control on the front . " i do n't have time for

[162/1000]	he paused - ' no - one . it 's a stupid idea . i 'm going on the attack , and you 're going too - ' ' this is foolish , ' snapped a voice . '
[163/1000]	" then you 're a fool , " he spat , " because you had all those men before you could get on a machine drive . you did this so you did n't have to be afraid of breaking
[164/1000]	" yeah , i just thought maybe you 'd be more willing to discuss your feelings , " she said . " i know you 've been through a lot already and ... um ... " " no ,
[165/1000]	" i will not be a monster . you are my daughter . if you understand the difference . i could not have borne that responsibility . not to myself . my family is gone . as i am left
[166/1000]	" how did she ... " the words died in his throat , as the sound broke off as another sob escaped . " it 's the only way . " he shook his head . " the
[167/1000]	it 's the first time i 've really felt as if i might actually like the people i work with . i 'm trying not to let that show on my face . " yeah , sure . come
[168/1000]	" well , what i think you need is a hot shower , " she answered . " that man has been up for hours , working out like a madman . he 'll be in a mood to f

[170/1000]	still it seemed like a good enough explanation . i shrugged when i noticed i was blushing when he smiled briefly again . he pulled my jeans and panties down me slowly and lightly , before he stopped and took
[171/1000]	" okay , but we had a lot of fun today . so do n't stop thinking about it ! " she told me and ran up the stairs to her room . i thought i was just coming
[172/1000]	the thought of being helpless in this situation made her skin itch . " yes , well . in many ways it 's worse , because the people you fight are not as kind or capable as they had
[173/1000]	a bit too late now . " what the fu - " i started . <EOS> fucking - " that 's a good boy . " with the tip of another machete he reached behind him to
[174/1000]	just thinking of his life and his future , his past made his heart race . he drew in a lungful of air , letting it slowly get caught in the lungs of the mare he 'd loved .
[175/1000]	" he does n't want to say anything , you know , " she told me , leaning against the wall on the opposite side of the hallway . " i 'm thinking he does n't have anything to
[176/1000]	" thank goodness you made it . sorry about that . " " oh , no problem . " " he said he would see you in the morning . " " he will ! " lucy

[179/1000]	" are you sure this is necessary , grace ? it will only make them nervous with the threat of some of the most important people in our world knowing they are going to be meeting with a politician ?
[180/1000]	an un coun table number of people were there . " and how did you do that ? " i asked . " you asked me that , too , " someone said , giving me a sideways
[181/1000]	" i 'll do what i can , but i 'm not taking any chances , " she said as she glanced behind her down the block . " yes , i wo n't argue that . "
[182/1000]	i walked back up the dirt path between the rows of vines . ahead of us , a light cut across a clearing next to a massive tree . what looked like a long , tall trunk reached all the
[183/1000]	not even this . not against the woman he loved . he loved her ... his mother . his mother loved him and he loved her . <EOS> in san bir tar . all the time
[184/1000]	" that 's it ? that 's it ? " " well , the best thing is , no one actually knows what they 're looking at , so they do n't even have to look over the back
[185/1000]	i shrug , knowing it 's all personal to him . " it sort of has me stumped when it comes to cars . i do n't drive one , of course , but i swear i can get into
[186/1000]	" because i have more of you than you know , " he says hoarsely into my hair . he lays my arms over my head and ties a length of my hair at the back of my head
[187/1000]	she stepped through the doorframe and into the room beyond . <EOS> and i thought , here we go , i 'm out of here , but she shook her head , grinning and then looked over her shoulder to
[188/1000]	" would any of you ladies care to explain to me what the hell is going on ? " she asks . " i always thought people looked to me , you know , like nothing else . but then
[189/1000]	i knew where the plan was going . " you put it behind the door ? " i asked . " and it 's a stupid place to keep a video camera , " she added , and i
[190/1000]	" oh , i guess there are some kinds of weapons that do n't die . they do n't get blown up by grenades and just blow themselves up . " " oh , " she said with a
[191/1000]	" hi baby , " i said into the phone , still feeling a little awkward and unsure of how to put the situation in low profile , but knowing i must do it . for her sake . that
[192/1000]	" good luck , then . " " good night . " i walked to his truck , but turned my head and waved at the town house . once i passed the house , i could see my

[194/1000]	just then <EOS> for a moment , her eyes went to the old car , remembering how her heart had felt like it was being ripped out by the giant , vicious , black , evil beast she 'd become
[195/1000]	" i ... your highness , " replied the duke . " your highness , i believe you need more ... " the two men paused for a very long moment and the duke thought about what he had just
[196/1000]	" i just ... " she bit her lip , and i wished i could tell her she would n't have to do this . " i 'm not ... i do n't know . maybe i should go to
[197/1000]	" of course you 're not , " replied the man , rising as well . " i find you two in the wrong bed . good night . " anna was taken to a bedroom that had

[200/1000]	a minute later he says , " shit , " and shifts his weight to one hand , but he still does n't move toward me . i hold his gaze . " if you think i 'm going
[201/1000]	" oh , no ! what 's going on ? " " my kids are n't my biggest fan . after i do so much cleaning and decorating , my wife and i got together and they asked if
[202/1000]	" wow . you know what happened to me , " he says suddenly . he turns away then . he reaches for my hand and slides his fingers through mine and wraps his arms around me from behind .
[203/1000]	" oh , look at your face ! " natalie cried as she sat up , pulling me over to her in the bed . i looked through my tears at natalie , still holding my elbows , still

[205/1000]	" i 've got to go fix something . " with that , they both rushed off to do what needed to be done . we sat in the kitchen for a few minutes in silence , then he
[206/1000]	" and i was so angry . every time you took what should have been mine , and i did nothing to stop it . you stole that from me , all the more so for that . " i
[207/1000]	" i never realized how much crap you paid me before i passed , " he murmured . " you got me , " she said , and then her hands lifted and covered his . " i want

[209/1000]	" and what is this ? " " it 's a picture of you smiling at the camera and when i first saw it i knew it was you from the way it held the photo that was taken
[210/1000]	" the thing is , this " - he motioned to the rock - " was not designed as a machine . " " so this may be a bomb ? " she asked . " possible ,
[211/1000]	" i say ' hello ' with a bit more force . " " it means , do n't look too long at that . " " i did n't look long at it . " "
[212/1000]	he dropped the bottle and rushed towards me , and with him his hand pressed to my chest , i felt as if someone had just lit a fire . " get away from me ! please , please
[213/1000]	" how 'd he find out ? " the professor smiled . " he found out from one of his college students , another - a couple of college professors , evidently - on his own . one day
[214/1000]	the guard took a moment to calm his nerves and when he spoke , it was barely audible . " you looked really hurt . " logan 's jaw hardened . " i 'm capable of any injury .

[219/1000]	the vampire took one step closer , and i quickly looked behind me and ran for the front door . i hit the dead bolt with my hands and let out a slow hiss as the door flew off
[220/1000]	" good god , man . just watch the soap dishes ! " adam was staring at the screen and said , " oh , all right , i 'm the sponge man . " " what 's
[221/1000]	" no , it does n't smell like beer or booze . " her eyes widened as she noticed the empty glasses . " oh " - she raised her hands to cover her flushed cheeks - " i 'm

[237/1000]	i grabbed a handful of her hair . " that 's my girl , " i whispered , letting go . she fell back to the bed , still panting . she tried to catch her breath . "

[241/1000]	i did n't really get the point of it much , but by the time david had convinced me that he did n't want to send me back to the dark fae , i was having a pretty rough time

[245/1000]	the thought had crossed my mind with surprise , but i dismissed it in favor of the necessity of taking out the rest of john 's remaining two footmen . " leave , " i said abruptly . "
[246/1000]	my expression lit up . " you 're afraid of me ? " " ah , crap . " " you 're afraid of no one ? " i said slowly , my expression suddenly panicked . "
[247/1000]	and then , they knew , oh oh so - very - sure , that they were in love with each other . chapter 1 the bar was small and full , but it was definitely full .

[253/1000]	she was beginning to wonder if she was . maybe her job would n't make her less lonely , after all . chapter 21 she was afraid the noise that had brought her out of a sleep

[257/1000]	" yes , " her answer was muffled against his right shirt , " i am . " she felt his mouth smile against her hair . " hey , we still on for dinner tonight ? "
[258/1000]	a moment later they were rolling through the parking lot . then back to the back of the bookstore , where she left a note . " you did n't have to go off on your own .

[260/1000]	but he did n't . the reason he went ahead with the deed was because his mother had been murdered . a tragedy his sister was unable to see . he had n't felt the death very well .
[261/1000]	you could have cut the electricity off . but he ca n't , and the sound of a knock at his door stops his questions . <EOS> - ( what the fuck ? ) the person standing

[269/1000]	" why wo n't you talk to me ? " asked chad . " you 're a pretty quiet boy . " " and you made me mad at you tonight , too . " " i
[270/1000]	he does n't seem to care that we 're about to get wet , i realize as i take off our wet clothes . it 's like all the energy he has is directed on me . " i
[271/1000]	" here . " he opened the closet doors and opened the suitcases he 'd left with the coffee mug . he took out another one from the shoe - box and made a show of tearing through it .
[272/1000]	" she was n't exactly the most comfortable person i knew . " " well , " added the other guardian , and looked like he was n't going to put up much of a fight but did n't
[273/1000]	" have you ever smoked anything besides beer at that party last night , sir ? " " no . " " no offense meant . but i want you to know you 've been very conscienti ous

[279/1000]	i said , " you 're going to have to wait a month , and i 'm pretty sure that 's a long time to wait . " " it is ? " he asked in amazement . he
[280/1000]	she looked at him at that moment , and though she could see his mind working on his first suggestion , she did not want to hear it . " you do n't need to worry about me .
[281/1000]	" oh , wait , " i said . " why did n't you just bite me or something ? " he glared at me . " what do you mean ? " " do it again
[282/1000]	they saw her , but the girl 's head was down and away from the others . " what was that ? " " do you ... want to be alone , alone ... " " no .
[283/1000]	my phone stopped vibrating . when i glanced at the caller id i saw that it was jude . it went to voicemail next of a bottle of water in my fridge . no . i was n't
[284/1000]	jack just laughed , and then he began to cry . so much for being able to trust him , she thought . all it was , really , in that split second of weakness , was that this
[285/1000]	" what are you staring at ? " at the sound of our voices , noah 's eyes moved to our left . i twisted to look . in the dim light , i watched another vampire walk
[286/1000]	" no , no . she will not be my mistress as well , " michael returned her look , but the spark of interest in his dark eyes betrayed that he was n't about to explain further .
[287/1000]	" i 'm so glad i got home last night , " he said as he sat down in the chair next to me . he had pulled his hair back into a ponytail while it was all knotted up
[288/1000]	" <EOS> " i 'm doing it to me . " " the man 's alive ! " i said , relieved to be free from the shackles of anger . " wow , i could use some help
[289/1000]	" does this mean you 'll be gone soon ? " ethan asked them . he already knew the answer , but the question still hung in the air . <EOS> with its eyes like burning coals which were smoldering
[290/1000]	" did that really make any difference ? " " it did . " the vampire said . she laughed and hugged her . " where are the others ? " " they are looking for me
[291/1000]	" the very image of them never hurts . this book is my best friend . " he reached into his backpack for something . " you 're about to have to get the hell out of here . "
[292/1000]	a few minutes later , the phone was delivered and i snatched it up , hoping no one had taken a phone call before i finally decided to check my messages . " who is it ? "
[293/1000]	" i ... i'm not sure , " she whispered . god ! what if the angel heard her ? he 'd know ... " you were right , " he assured her . " he could be coming
[294/1000]	" okay , " she said , trying to breathe through the pain . she fought the urge to vomit . if she could n't keep her mouth shut about this , it was out . " i 'm
[295/1000]	the first hand - held phone was a blur . the second hand - held phone was still un returned . the third hand - held phone was still un called . he was back to the phone ,
[296/1000]	" what now ? " i asked . it was hard to think with all of this noise rattling from my head . " we go to the hospital . if we stay here , they 'll come look
[297/1000]	" and if you stay here you 'll see him ? " " i really do not know , tom . <EOS> - " then his mind started talking . " what has happened here ? " '
[298/1000]	" i 've brought you <EOS> , " she said to the dark shadows of her mind , but she never told him how much , finally finding one for the darkness . it might take centuries of training to
[299/1000]	" you do n't get it , " i say , forcing the words out . " you know . " he does n't , but i 'm not going to tell him . " he gets all the bullshit
[300/1000]	" uh huh . " i pushed my way past the staff without looking him in the eyes . i exited the room , my back to the hallway with the elevator . i headed to the lobby and
[301/1000]	" oh come on ... " he leaned in close , nuzzling her neck . " we never played this game before . " her hands reached up , brushing against the heavy muscles of his chest , his
[302/1000]	i knew we 'd made progress all the time , and in order for me to believe we would n't be heading back to base , i would need the money to buy tickets to hawaii , and something else
[303/1000]	" are you okay ? " i shake my head . " nothing . i just need to go down to the kitchen and hit the road . " i stand and walk out the door , leaving
[304/1000]	the only reason they 'd brought her with them was that she might even be able to find some help . the way her clothes looked and could be a help , she would be able to find if she
[305/1000]	" the people in your family thought you should help them out by telling them they were entitled to this place . " as though i needed reminding , i recalled what they 'd tried to say and gave
[306/1000]	" that 's quite a lot of shit , " i said . he shrugged as if he 'd asked the wrong question . " so how do you wanna handle it ? " " well , as
[307/1000]	" yes , dad . " peter turned to her . " i 'm sorry , mom . " " why are you calling me that ? " charlotte shook the phone . " it 's your mother
[308/1000]	i would just have to be patient . as i put the car in park , i heard my cell phone ring . turning the music off , i grabbed my keys and ran for the door . i
[309/1000]	' let me check the files , first . ' she let him , and to her surprise , a copy was on the kitchen counter . but there was no registration number on the file . perhaps if
[310/1000]	' we 're running out of time , ' he told her before turning around and walking away . ' i know it wo n't be long here before we 've got people all over this place . '
[311/1000]	" we 're not asking you to do any permanent damage , jim . " i paused , unsure just how to proceed . " i suppose you 're right , jim . but i do want to stay
[312/1000]	" the truth might have gotten out . " he stopped walking . he turned to face her and a few steps later , she was leaning against the locker . he wrapped an arm around her waist and
[313/1000]	they broke their fast as soon as dinner was put away . " i 'll pay for some extra time to help you out , " he said . " but i do n't know how much is too much
[314/1000]	" you want my money , " i said . " in one condition . " " i have n't taken your offer . " " you do n't have a choice . " i went
[315/1000]	" wow ! " " is n't it sweet of you to not make me tell everyone about it ? " he shook his head , smiling so widely that he almost had dimples instead of cheekbones .
[316/1000]	he gave me a sardonic look , and then his head inclined to her . " hello , ladies . " i stiffened as his voice filled the room . " you know them ? " he grinned
[317/1000]	" he 's not , " i agreed . " so what the hell is he doing <EOS> , then ? he just stepped out of the way . someone has to have him , " she shouted back
[318/1000]	" as long as we stay away from the south end of town , we should be okay . but , stay close to me , and do n't let anyone get too far behind me . " she
[319/1000]	a cold chill went up his spine . fear . because they were leaving the cabin . leaving him behind . he had n't planned this . but that did n't matter any longer . do
[320/1000]	when he was three thousand on the verge of being released , his whole plan to escape became a joke . he thought he was going to get free in some other country , wherever that country might be .
[321/1000]	" yeah , i mean , my name is amy , and i ca n't say that i 've never heard of you , amy . " she said and stuck out her hand towards me , " it 's
[322/1000]	" she is in my room , " i growled . " when did she leave my room ? " he asked . i ground my teeth together to stop myself from screaming . " you 're
[323/1000]	i was too tired to think , too tired to care . " what 's wrong ? " i said softly . " what 's wrong ? " his gaze snapped to mine . " we should n't
[324/1000]	then all of a sudden it was gone . chapter 5 " no , " said zachary . " what ? i thought you said you were a doctor . " " i was when we
[325/1000]	and that 's when i see a bright flash in the distance . it 's what i suspect caused aramei 's death , but she does n't react to my presence as i expect her to and neither should i
[326/1000]	" i see . do you want to do a little test in order to see which you have ? " i told him and he shook his head in response . " okay , then . now what about
[327/1000]	he looked over his shoulder . julia followed his gaze . a half - smiling tom was leaning against the car in front of him , laughing at something she said . " hey , how about you not
[328/1000]	it was no use . i was on a high and i did n't feel it , did n't feel anything at all like it was happening . " yes , this is the end , " i
[329/1000]	" was it hard losing your loved ones ? " " no . but it 's still hard to lose them . " " i have lost the love of my life . in two short months .
[330/1000]	" what ? " she said , surprised to find something so different inside of her . " do what ? " " nothing . are you done ? " he asked , and again she had nothing in
[331/1000]	" that can not be . you are too young for that . " her mother sighed . " mother , you ca n't say anything until your day has been done , then you come to me .
[332/1000]	" you ca n't stay , " his father said . " your sister will need you . " " do n't tell her , " his mother said . " i told her to wait a week .
[333/1000]	" i never knew much about his former life , " rose told him . " nor do i have anything to share with you except the fact that he had much more money than i did . "
[334/1000]	" we want him to know that we suspect him of having caused a very high level of financial and moral embarrassment to the company and he is the only person who will make the necessary effort to speak with
[335/1000]	" where did you think you were ? " she asked , watching as the woman took the envelope . she shrugged , not wanting to put her trust in a stranger . " i had business in
[336/1000]	you do n't need to know , not yet anyway . " are you okay ? " i took a deep breath and straightened myself so i did n't give in to the overwhelming urge to throw myself
[337/1000]	her lips trembled and the tears caught in her eyes . she covered her mouth with her hands , not knowing whether to tell him of her fears or just ask him straight out how he knew . he
[338/1000]	" do n't worry . " her eyes slid shut in surrender . " i 'm good at remembering you when it 's gone . " the touch of her mouth on his drove him to his knees .
[339/1000]	" there 's a woman in the office with you , " she said , pushing the door open wider . " no ! i 'm alone . " " you must have her number . "
[340/1000]	" he wants you to dance ? " " yes . " although the thought of taking a step , even just a tiny step , kept her walking . " then why do n't you ? "
[341/1000]	" how could you forget such a delicate case ? " another voice chided . " did you not mention there is a new assistant in the group now ? " " yes , mr. anderson sent me .
[342/1000]	" how 's the boy ? " the woman asked when erin ran to open the door for him . he grinned , a grin that could n't really hide the fact that he was grinning like a fool
[343/1000]	he ignored it . " let 's leave him be . they give everyone a reason to have some satisfaction . maybe he 'll go back there to fight another day . " " will you keep your distance
[344/1000]	" that sounds a lot like how i 'd be - " " are you interested in me ? " " maybe . you do n't look like the woman for me . " " but you
[345/1000]	" i 'm sorry i came , " she offered . " it was n't your fault . " " i wish it had been . " his eyes flicked to brian . " what was that ... "
[346/1000]	and then he saw it , the great red hand . i turned my head . his fist was on the door sill - which he had swung open - and he was pointing a finger . he shook
[347/1000]	she had . she 'd gone to do what some would call " sex on a couch . " " so then what happened ? " he asked . " i walked out of the room . i
[348/1000]	" it was your fault , " she said . " the night you betrayed me and your father . none of this day was supposed to have happened . you had the right to choose what you want .
[349/1000]	that was the first time he 'd ever been inside in new orleans . the vampires had n't taken a vacation in a long time . he was the first vamp to ever visit such an antebellum home .
[350/1000]	there were no more threats , no more whispers , or orders of some kind . two hours passed in peaceful silence . i started to wonder if they were only waiting for me to make an break ,
[351/1000]	" hey , " said heather . " what did he give you ? " " he would n't explain , " said heather , her face unreadable . " was n't sure what to make of it
[352/1000]	" no , i did n't ! i mean , i thought you were coming for me before the fight , but it 's been so long . i ca n't believe it . how could you miss me that
[353/1000]	" look - " he held up his right hand . " it 's not me . it 's her . " " her ? " i said . " who the hell is she ? and why would
[354/1000]	" that little girl is so hungry , " said dr. du pont . a nurse came in , handing mark a dish of ice - cream , and a plate with a piece of fudge . she brought her
[355/1000]	" no , sir , it was n't . " " it was in the house . do you know where it was , paul ? " " it went in the kitchen . but that 's the
[356/1000]	" yes , so your mother was sent to jail and that was that . " " really ? well , i was n't really worried about any of that . i thought you might want to be in
[357/1000]	" i 'd better not . " he slid his hand over her waist , then lifted her ass to allow him better access . he grabbed the collar and jerked hard . the top of her head popped out
[358/1000]	" have n't they come out to give me my meds or something ? " " probably , " says joe wearily . " they 're in the car , outside the medical clinic . " " you
[359/1000]	" what the hell ? " caleb barked . " well , that puts it in a high category . he 's the first man in the lore , woman , and child to actually want a child with a
[360/1000]	" thank you for coming , " i said , letting a note of anxiety creep into my tone . " no problem . i like to do a lot of things i like to do when i 'm
[361/1000]	" did he take her back ? " nick asked . dante shook his head . " not that it 's any of our business , but we got a deal going here that requires someone else to keep
[362/1000]	she had n't thought of a name for it yet . all she knew of him was that he wanted her to talk . and he was n't the only one . she 'd spent the evening in a kitchen
[363/1000]	no help where this one was concerned . she took a quick glance down the rows . there were some women in white blouses and slacks . there were a handful of people in white dresses . they were all
[364/1000]	" uh , so you know he lives in london , too , " she says . " well , duh . i 'd know , " i say . i like him . " well , no
[365/1000]	" are you okay ? " something about her demeanor had changed for the better now that she 'd come home . now there was something different about her - or at least , a slightly different vibe in
[366/1000]	" no , i 'm sorry but no , not you . i just do n't think about her the way other women do . it 's been a very long time since i 've let someone in . as
[367/1000]	" you 're ... do you have any idea how f * * king adorable you are in those clothes ? " i could n't move . his voice was so low and hypnotic , it was almost
[368/1000]	he shrugged . " i think i might be in trouble if you do n't return my calls . " " why ? " an impatient sound cut through the call . " because you 're on my
[369/1000]	and i was a lot like her . i could put her down if she wanted to run . but i had faith in my abilities , which meant i 'd try harder , take as many steps as was
[370/1000]	as the vehicle , drawn by the noise , rounded the bend in the driveway for a moment , anna saw that tommy had pulled out into the lane and was heading in her way . she stopped and started
[371/1000]	" so you know the name of the band already . what 's your name ? " i could hear her breath hitch as the night breeze tickled her body . she was staring at the moon . "
[372/1000]	" you should definitely speak to your elders , " he said , dropping his voice almost to a whisper of anticipation . " i can see the change in them . " his voice trailed off in concern .
[373/1000]	the car was n't the closest thing around : it was several tons off of the main road . the driver was missing not only his face , which was missing several teeth , but also both hands , as
[374/1000]	" that 's better . " he smiles , but there 's a crease in his forehead . " you did n't tell me about your dreams , and again , if you 're worried about me , i can
[375/1000]	he did n't give me time to respond . he bent his hips and drove one into me with strong , rough strokes that were full of purpose . " say it ! " he growled . "
[376/1000]	" at my wedding , i was out on a work break . " she swallowed hard . " we found him dead on the sidewalk . i did n't know he was dead until the paramedics entered the building
[377/1000]	" no , " i whispered . " i - you just ca n't . " " i ca n't be an ass * * le , " he said . " i need to do a f *
[378/1000]	the men laughed . " you 're insane . " " actually , i 'm kind of glad we did n't have to . " " what the hell are you talking about ? " "
[379/1000]	the doctor appeared behind the old man and bowed respectfully . " my boy , " he said , " i 'm doctor tu tt ler from the oxford laboratory . " the doctor was barely thirty , and
[380/1000]	" you 're right , we were at a disadvantage . " he glanced at his watch . " we 're going to be late . " " just how late is a great question . " this
[381/1000]	" i do n't want to hurt you . i want to love you and protect you . i hate the world and i 'm ashamed to be . and that does n't make you that person . there has
[382/1000]	she looked at him , un comprehending . " you have n't thought about it then ? " " no . although you have . as if you have <EOS> all the time . i want to go around
[383/1000]	oh yes . he was definitely into her . she wanted something from him , but yet that something was obvious . as much as she found him very annoying , it was also exciting to have other people around
[384/1000]	" i have got to be off . " " well , do n't talk back to me until you 've had some sleep . " " okay . " she made no move to leave .
[385/1000]	i was suddenly extremely uncomfortable with the whole " what if she said she was pregnant " thing . i found myself reaching for a piece of licor ice , and when i dropped it in my mouth , i
[386/1000]	" you are not here to seduce us . " braith 's voice was cold . his eyes were bleak . " by the laws of our race , you are not here . " " i will not
[387/1000]	i tried to think through the new development that had occurred , but i could n't remember what it had been . what did it reflect in my career ? i could n't remember being in a position where i
[388/1000]	his heart beat faster . he 'd taken a step in the right direction and now he was about to ride the next one of these , the one that was taking action for which he 'd vowed to her
[389/1000]	" or the ones i killed . but most of them are vampires , " ashe grinned . " at least the ones winkler and the others destroyed . " " i know ; winkler said you were there
[390/1000]	" they 'll be pissed about this , man , " he muttered . " it 's okay . i 've got a pair of panties you can wear and i 've lost weight . " her heart
[391/1000]	i went to bed with me staring at the ceiling and thinking about all those years ago , too late . i 'd gone to dinner with my dad with friends . he 'd been a tall , serious ,
[392/1000]	" i would tell him , " i said . " if he 'd asked . " " would you - " i smiled . " if you thought i 'd let him down ? would you feel
[393/1000]	jack 's eyes light up slowly . " i did n't know so many , but i figured a big house would be just how they wanted their books . i could n't recall when that was . "
[394/1000]	" i was joking . " rachel started . the next day i went to work early , and i walked into my office , looking out my window . the people in my office were always on
[395/1000]	a knock came at the door and i pulled the bed sheets from my body and wrapped myself around jonathan . i hoped he 'd take note of my proximity to him last night so that he would at least
[396/1000]	" i do n't have a choice but to take them on as you command , " said caleb . " very good , lieutenant . continue your pursuit , " said joseph . caleb called over his
[397/1000]	" really . " " and i 'm not crazy . " " it 's important for you to think , " beth said . " not stupid , beth . " she shrugged . "
[398/1000]	" no it is not . " he said flatly , " do you know what else the power of the holy spirit is i 've thought about all day . i just do n't know whether you will accept
[399/1000]	with her gaze locked on theirs , she told him , " you are n't really in your right mind , but you 're going to want to tell me . then you are going to tell me everything that
[400/1000]	i ignored him . " you know , what should i do about dinner ? " he looked confused at first but quickly brightened at his own new idea and suggested a leisurely ride through the countryside . i
[401/1000]	" no one should ever know you 've kept her secrets . she was n't told any of us existed . she 's a very happy girl , and she 's going to be loved . " the thought
[402/1000]	' no , you do n't ? ' came the sarcastic reply from the other side , perhaps in the midst of a chuckle was the intended answer . ' well , i expect there 's nothing to tell then
[403/1000]	" uh , okay . " then he stood , his gaze moving around the room . " i think it 's probably a good idea to have this part worked out in the first place - in that case
[404/1000]	chapter six they sat in the small town of whi techa pel , not too far from the city 's river . as she drove down the rutted streets , she pulled her kerchief from her mouth , wadded
[405/1000]	" i do n't know . " " what about you , dad ? " he tried to smile at us . " i keep telling you . i keep telling you . " " you do
[406/1000]	" i 'm not ... not like that . " she was n't sure if that was true . but if she was honest with herself , she might be . " are you sure about that ? "
[407/1000]	i had , when she looked at me . but now , my face hardened and my muscles bunched . " your father 's father , " i said , without inflection , as if speaking to my own
[408/1000]	" are you sure ? " she asked . " yes . " i knew it was stupid , but i did n't care at this point . i did n't understand anything she did or said , and
[409/1000]	" yeah . he never even looks at you like he sees the inside of your body . and then all the time you were in his bed , he was ready to tie you up in his office ,
[410/1000]	but i felt no guilt . never had . not for how i wanted him to handle it - and yet , i did . i wanted to do what i could to protect him . i need to .
[411/1000]	" all right - " jake started , but stopped when he saw the expression in the kid 's eyes change . charlie sighed , shook her head , and said , " i thought not , but , well
[412/1000]	he rolled to the left just just in time to catch the brunt of another impact . he kicked the pipe aside and swung one of the big rods into a round hole in the floor . " you
[413/1000]	" she 's right . can i see you ? " " of course . " helen opened the door wider , and abby drove through . tara left the truck running on the side of the road .
[414/1000]	now there were problems ! " i knew you were serious when you said you did n't think we 'd make a good couple , " brian said , coming out of his thoughts himself . " it
[415/1000]	he smiled , " i know . " i shook my head and smiled back . " your cousin will have a good time and see you tonight . " he nodded and said , " yeah ,
[416/1000]	" yes . " " so , you said ... " " i said that i know what you are , and that you 're more than i 'd had in a while . " " i
[417/1000]	" thank you , " she said , hoping he would n't comment . " that 's really thoughtful . " " you are n't , are you ? " that had n't sounded like him at all .
[418/1000]	" have to get them to show you more than two - fold . let 's see how a plan goes , shall we ? but first let 's take our time and try out what we can find around
[419/1000]	what had been a moment ago was now filled with profound regret . for he loved her , loved her as he had never loved anyone , and at the same time feared he was in agony after losing
[420/1000]	" hey you little twer p . what 's the matter , what 's the matter with you ? " she says , rolling her eyes and jabbing her finger against my chest . my mom , who stood with
[421/1000]	the girls had taken over the kitchen from her , and even caroline had taken over cooking , putting in mugs of coffee and stirring in vegetables ; the kitchen looked cheerful and homey from the great room which was
[422/1000]	" his brothers are n't exactly nice about you . " " i 'm not complaining , we have our work cut out for us . " i smile back . i 'm in a good mood because
[423/1000]	" why ? " she blinked at him , stunned . " why am i so important to you that you would care ? " he closed his eyes for a long moment and then opened them . "
[424/1000]	" you might be surprised what a little girl can do with her mouth - " " i do n't care if you find out , " he cut me off again . " it does n't matter .
[425/1000]	" but you were always good at being the perfect boyfriend . i mean , i 'm sure you have plenty of girls in college , but never have i ever seen you as the real person , have you
[426/1000]	sam could n't help but smile . he could n't help but think of how many times he 'd left the hospital in the middle of the night because of this case and how many others he 'd gotten involved
[427/1000]	" you can go , " i agree . " but with me , you 're going to come out of the car . we 're going to call the police . " he shakes his head . "
[428/1000]	' where do i start ? she needs what you left . she 's too sweet ! you 're too big . ' ' there was a girl , amy , i 've tried and tried until ... '
[429/1000]	chapter fifteen the night had begun well and it was clear that the day was going to be any more difficult than i would have liked . the sky above the manor was clear and the rain still fell
[430/1000]	" <EOS> " . " they do n't know , love . you 're not the enemy . " " i meant to get your head around what i 'm talking about and end all this bloodshed in the
[431/1000]	" and i want you to send me a file containing all of your other personal information as well . what 's different , however - " " because it 's a bit complicated ? " " i
[432/1000]	" i 'm not sure . " she looked at her watch . " i do n't know . if i got home at this hour , i 'm supposed to be at work , but i did n't
[433/1000]	* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * a red - tailed hawk with a red - tipped feather flapped its leathery wings and flew above the
[434/1000]	" you had fun ? " she grinned devilishly , her eyes roaming over me . " yeah , " i grinned , biting my lip . " i mean , i do n't remember you being this easy
[435/1000]	" no , that is not entirely true , and with time you shall earn yourself a better account - " once again the tone was so patronizing to laurence , when they were speaking directly of the covert
[436/1000]	he leaned forward and grabbed a paper towel from the counter . " i 'm sorry , " he said . " i did n't mean to shock you . " " i 'm sure you did n't
[437/1000]	" so , " he said , shifting his weight onto one hip . " i 'm wondering why those ladies got so uppity - " " they were jealous . " " they were jealous , "
[438/1000]	" you 've been here before ? " she asked . " no , i 've never been to the library . i ca n't wait to see your eyes . " she smiled . " are you
[439/1000]	you ca n't talk to ethan about this , holly . it does n't matter who else knew about your pregnancy . they 'd kill you . please do n't . her hand reached up to her lips .
[440/1000]	" my mother , " said ellen . " she was really bright , but , honestly , she was poor . my father used to yell at her all the time . he started talking about her just to
[441/1000]	he did not respond and stared into the glowing embers , then up at the night sky . he thought about what had just happened , about all of it , and at that moment he did not care about
[442/1000]	" oh , yeah , all three , actually . but we 'll take it to italy . " " you 'll take the whole thing to italy ? " " come on . you are pretty sure
[443/1000]	" i do n't like talking about who the killer is , " a younger woman said . " okay , you do n't have to , " i assured her . " i promise . " i
[444/1000]	" i do n't follow , " i said , and then i changed my mind . " wait . no . no , i ca n't do that . " jonathan smiled and rubbed the back of his
[445/1000]	" oh , do let me get at least one or two details out of this , " the sheriff said . " now that you 're gone , would you mind to tell me something that has scared you
[446/1000]	i was not wrong about that , i assure you . it seemed to me that this was only a tiny fraction of the amount i had learned in one week . " your point ? " she asked
[447/1000]	" do you enjoy it ? " he asked . his hand tightened on me , pulled me close , pressing my breast against his chest with a slight movement and my stomach dipped . what i liked more
[448/1000]	" i do . i would have done the same . " i can hear the regret in his voice . " he went through the door with no one the wiser . his father was only a tool
[449/1000]	" really . i came to find you because i 'm concerned about things the cat could not handle <EOS> just one " - because i 'm hanging in the oven , " or ... " it 's hard
[450/1000]	" but - " " it 's this , " i said through my teeth . i began to pull away , and she was n't so easily deterred . she grabbed my neck , and i squirmed
[451/1000]	" do we have time ? " " of course . " he stared at his watch and then frowned . " we should get down there right away . i 'll send a couple of ships out
[452/1000]	" do n't worry about me . i 'm just going to go for the salad . " i reach my hand out to him and he grabs my hand tightly . " how about a double helping of
[453/1000]	her response was brief and simple . " i still think i need a therapist . " " perhaps we can talk about that at the party ? " a new way of thinking to do it , he
[454/1000]	" shit , " he muttered . " he 's been calling me late . " i 'd forgotten that i 'd accidentally texted him when i 'd stopped being at his house ; on the other hand ,
[455/1000]	" <EOS> how did you do a last - minute , dude . i think you 're looking at the real deal . " ben 's cell phone rang as he stood to leave . " who 's
[456/1000]	three , sometimes four , of my clients come back . four , sometimes five or six . all of them come back with more packages than i 've ever seen in the house in five years . one of
[457/1000]	it could have been the whole thing , but i 'd never trusted her parents . i told them to meet us at their own ranch , because that way we 'd know where to find out the truth .
[458/1000]	" will you do that for me ? " i would do anything for him . " " never , " she said at once . " do n't make a decision based on hope , and do
[459/1000]	so , i just told you i 'm leaving the university of virginia for california . " " i 've heard of it and i thought that was a pretty much non - productive course you had . "
[460/1000]	" you 'll be sorry , " the old man uttered into the dust and blew me a kiss . " you 're on your own , old man , " i muttered back , and headed into the
[461/1000]	i was too busy standing there looking like an idiot to finish up , and let her know it . instead , i just stared for a moment , trying to figure out what the hell she 'd been thinking
[462/1000]	' that is a nice thing to say , doctor , yes , ' said nanny , nodding happily . ' and of course my husband was watching the news on a tv and saw the show . how could
[463/1000]	for the first time ever , i understood why her father had kept her this way for so long . <EOS> sure as heck , even as a toddler . because , even though she 'd wanted to please
[464/1000]	there are things we are both familiar with that will never be seen , and i am certain no one else is either , but i hope you are a better man than i am , and that you will
[465/1000]	but this is n't how he wrote it . he 'd written it as the first verse , the last words he 'd had access to . it had been ten years since the other verse had spoken in
[466/1000]	there was a moment of silence but then mr. harris said in a bored voice , " this is a waste of time . " " who cares ? " said mr. hastings . " do you know who
[467/1000]	" what are you talking about , i just looked at the photos and there 's nothing of him anywhere . " " what photos ? do you want to put him away or throw away the evidence ,
[468/1000]	" but why would anyone want to kill him ? " her lips trembled . " do n't do this , " he growled as he lowered his mouth until he could capture her lips in a gentle
[469/1000]	" we are an odd bunch , " came a voice behind them , and so they turned to see the old man in the robe and the blue turban standing in the shadows by the door . " for
[470/1000]	on their return , a small group of men who all shared a small laugh at the joke that their leader had made while serving in the army . " you , " the leader said . " my
[471/1000]	he kissed her with a fervor that sent even that one kiss to her toes and sent her racing to land on him , to feel the hardness of him against the softness of her body . his tongue swept
[472/1000]	the old man , a little taller than me , was dressed in leather pants and a white shirt with sleeves that were open over his chest . his feet were bare except for a pair of short sandals .
[473/1000]	' i 've turned up this week out of breath , my stomach is in knots . how did you - ' ' i thought we could pretend that i was a werewolf . ' she grins .
[474/1000]	" where are we going ? " she asked abruptly . hunter felt as though he 'd been dropped like a stone . " we 'll catch a plane to sydney , " he said . " i 'm
[475/1000]	i turned to see her gaze fastened on the door . once the door shut behind me , her grip turned into a fist at her side , and she stepped forward toward me and slapped a hard slap across
[476/1000]	" i told you he was stupid . " she smirked again at simon . he took a step forward , blocking kevan 's path . " you are the stupid one , that 's what you got ,
[477/1000]	" what was that ? " he shrugs . " i 'm getting very good at ignoring things . " " what else is new ? " he flashes a cocky grin , takes my hands ,
[478/1000]	she pulled her gaze from the image and took his hand . " go to bed . " he did n't argue . her sister was in their room , and she 'd called amanda and found the
[479/1000]	" there is only this one <EOS> - " " he 'd say , hey , hey , no duh , " charlie said in agreement . " are you happy about the ring ? " " it
[480/1000]	" just keep moving toward the right side of the trail . she 's off for now , but she 'll be following when you see her . " " of course . " " i 'll be
[481/1000]	in her ear , he whispered , " take your clothes off . " he waited for a moment before she did as he 'd asked , her jeans riding low on her hips of their own accord even
[482/1000]	she did n't know whether to laugh or cry . * * * twenty minutes later , she pulled into a parking spot outside the art building . she knew they would n't be leaving because she 'd
[483/1000]	the only point that bothered him as he looked through his notes was the fact that he had already read that other message about the missing girl . there was no point in chasing after it , so he was
[484/1000]	" yes . you can see your little brother , but you ca n't see what your mother and grandfather do . the demon knows his father 's name and now he is only a dark - hunter . and
[485/1000]	" yes . " " and how exactly did we get into this conversation ? " " i do n't want to talk about it , " she told him , not very successfully . " i heard
[486/1000]	" to the very top ! " they said , each with the utmost excitement . " a cliff , but without any branches or vegetation to hinder our progress , we can still reach it . " "
[487/1000]	" we 'll get you home , " she said , her eyes burning into him . " i 'll be there as soon as i can . " as if it were a curse , he snapped his
[488/1000]	he thought it a bit foolish to be doing this . but he could n't think about that now . only of getting her back inside , out of the rain . he pressed his face flat against hers
[489/1000]	he gave at the end of every week , but sometimes with what looked like a half dozen more , and i 'd lose focus , not realizing how huge it really was until a few days after she left
[490/1000]	" did you , " i asked . i was starting to get a little dizzy , and the nausea in my stomach was mounting . i could n't go back , not even to the hotel . what if
[491/1000]	" maybe the same . we had some fights , though . " " i 'm not sure that i 'd call that fighting . it was a little more than that . " " it was a
[492/1000]	" i 'm sorry in advance , " nick said , and he meant it . it was a strange thing to offer ; that seemed foreign to him . his words gave his mind enough energy to draw his
[493/1000]	<EOS> and then we met at the bar , and he kissed me like he meant it . i let him kiss me until i was dizzy . and then we went on . chapter eighteen
[494/1000]	" it 's the only way now , " she whispered , watching him carefully . paul leaned in to kiss her on the lips , his heart filling up with such a strong emotion that no words could
[495/1000]	" we were able to identify him for the first time on the video . we will go from there . " " you knew who he was from the second he was at the ranch ? "
[496/1000]	" that is , " he agreed smoothly . " this is your home . " she frowned . " are n't you the one who has a house ? " " no , as a matter of
[497/1000]	" all right , " i say . " i 'll meet you outside . " the next morning i am on a plane back to sydney the next morning . once i 'm on the plane , i
[498/1000]	" look ! " said miss fellowes . " look at them ! they 're not eating , they 're - " one of the children dropped a little red object onto the floor of stasis . miss fellowes
[499/1000]	with a sigh of resignation , i finally let go and i let my mind rest into my world until my body is at peace . ' i 'm feeling better , thank you . sorry about that ,
[500/1000]	" i 'm not talking about that . " michael stepped out . " not you . i 'm talking about the girl . the girl that did her time , who had a boyfriend . the girl who escaped
[501/1000]	but he did n't trust this . what was he supposed to do ? he had been doing things that he had no control over . things like seducing this girl . and he 'd done so with
[502/1000]	" you ca n't be serious ! this has to be in order once she 's cured ! " " and i ca n't risk sending her back there after she 's better . and then again , i
[503/1000]	they have a plan . the storm was getting worse , heavier and more violent , and in its aftermath the fires burned brightly - bright with the fury of a thousand suns . she heard the thunder of
[504/1000]	" so , that 's it , " said chello . " that 's how it works . you can get an audience from everyone you know , and you can tell them the words , and it 's how
[505/1000]	" no , " she replied finally . <EOS> " we 're not . it 's too late . you 've changed your mind . " " what do you mean ? " she watched his expression change to
[506/1000]	" what 's going on ? " asked heather , but heather just walked off and stood on the porch . " i came to thank you . " " for what ? " " for helping
[507/1000]	" you know , " i say , " i think you 're really good , you really want it . " this is only partly true though . " what ? " he asks . "
[508/1000]	" but you 've gone this whole time with just one love , right ? " i asked him . " yes . " " why ? " he shrugged . " i do n't know .
[509/1000]	she was too weary to open her mouth . all she could do was give a soft sigh and drift away . her only thought was to rest . she would drift for so long and never awaken .
[510/1000]	i looked at emma as she looked into the distance , and i knew she was thinking about pete being gone . i waited for her to ask why she was keeping it a secret . she shook her
[511/1000]	" yes , " richard agreed quietly . " the dragon has n't moved . it 's very brave , even if its only fear is because it 's trying to do the right thing . " " how
[512/1000]	a slow heat built building inside of me , and i felt my eyes widen . being a vampire did n't scare me ; it 'd almost seemed like a normal thing on a bad halloween , until i met
[513/1000]	" yeah , " i said , my attention clearly on dad as he nodded my head then bent and started pulling my boots into the corner , looking around . he straightened and faced me , hand still on
[514/1000]	his head twisted sideways , so that she had no choice but to look up at him . " you did n't want you to see that . " " but - it could have been a problem ,
[515/1000]	" a doctor would n't explain a brain tumor <EOS> inside the mind . i 'm certain mrs. cro man 's heart is a secret , but let me tell you something . " i 'm getting the feeling
[516/1000]	" we are the family of the next generation to take him under our wing again . " my mom grins . she 's pretty gorgeous too . perfect deep brown hair , creamy skin , and straight eyebrows of
[517/1000]	' but he seemed so familiar . ' her head hung low . ' he was my husband . he gave me the best of everything . <EOS> never thought i could do so easily and yet i felt
[518/1000]	a voice spoke before the girl could reply . the two men faced each other across the room , their face just inches apart . in one hand , he held up a small piece of paper , or paper
[519/1000]	" good ! " i threw the sheet back , got up on my feet , and yelled to the bartender . " water , please ! and bring him a towel ! " " i 'll do it
[520/1000]	' sorry . ' ' <EOS> ' ' oh try a man they 've got a bag , we 're on the kettle , we can go down and have a good chair in the room the hall
[521/1000]	" the last time i was in the prison , i was a prisoner , and many were murdered in my defense . " " i need to know if you think of them like that . "
[522/1000]	her lips tightened , and she gave a little shake of her head before reaching for the ring . she tore the ring from its gold chain , slipped it onto her finger , and did a quick loop around
[523/1000]	" we do not go through this because you are afraid to travel . we have to take advantage of his ignorance . " she seemed conflicted about it , then looked at me . " whatever you decide
[524/1000]	" so the same goes for you and your brothers and me , " i said , keeping my tone soft . " and if that 's the case , why ask me ? " " all i wanted
[525/1000]	" just a minute , " he whispered in my ear and then , with the slightest of touches , he kissed one of the sensitive sensitive spots on my neck ; my back bowed against the wall as he
[526/1000]	i do n't fight the urge to rub my palm against my chest , which is still wound tight from what i just put through . " well , that 's a very nice way ' nice , nice
[527/1000]	there was also a slight risk of having a demon - related injury . the mark of the demon must be removed after healing , which would kill him immediately . another risk , but not as big as the
[528/1000]	she ran her fingers through it . " fine . whatever . " " i wo n't . i 'm in the middle of something . " " go on . " " first off , i
[529/1000]	" oh , there you are . are you eating ? " she said as she grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and placed it on the table between them . " what are you doing here
[530/1000]	i take a deep breath and sit up . " okay , so you guys are just going to accept this ? " " no . we 're staying here . " i breathe out a sigh of
[531/1000]	' they 're so easy to murder . ' her mother made a face . ' do you think he could live with that ? ' ' i think he 'd be insane to kill people like them
[532/1000]	" i do n't know , " he said again . why was n't he talking ? <EOS> ... the baby girl . " i want to f * * k for a long time . "
[533/1000]	once inside , the old warehouse had its own door in back to the main entry area where the first man from the gate had come a few seconds earlier . <EOS> all three prisoners were chained together , and
[534/1000]	" and even your ex - husband is a gentleman . would n't that make a difference ? " her words cut him even deeper than the sharp reminder of her relationship with eric had done . and the
[535/1000]	a loud crash of light from over the tree line startled me and i whirled to see the black haired man standing there . he was still holding the bow and reel with both hands while the whole side of
[536/1000]	" what ? a thousand ? " " yeah , and as soon as it hits them it 'll be just like when you had your heart attack . they know what happened because i 've told them .
[537/1000]	" i ca n't help but notice that you have my son tattooed somewhere on your body . how did you make the tattoo look like you did ? " " there are some perks to being alive .
[538/1000]	" it 's nothing , " i said , ignoring the look in his face . i pulled a pad of paper out of my bra ; i had no plan for what to write . " i know this
[539/1000]	" but they 've let him go . he has n't talked about it for a week , so he wo n't . " " and so after eight years you suddenly get this sense that he knows what
[540/1000]	" i think i 'm going to get my drink now , " she said . she had been right in the beginning about the alcohol . it was the alcohol on autopilot all over again . if she
[541/1000]	" what are you doing ? " she asked . " i 'm taking you to dinner . " " i 'm not going to any restaurant . " " yes , you will . i 'm
[542/1000]	" yeah , well , i probably would have taken it a lot farther than i needed to , but i 'm sure you have more questions i should just answer , right ? " the answer was almost
[543/1000]	but even in bed , where people came and went ... so he was n't sleeping . i wondered what was eating him . then i got into bed and turned on the light . chapter seven
[544/1000]	" a week ago , " he said quietly . " from the time your mother did their marriage announcement , one small bit of blood mixed with the natural blood of a witch was sent to him . then
[545/1000]	all nine dogs ran across the courtyard , away from the tower , toward the gate . there was no escaping the dogs . 32 december 19 , 11: 42 a.m. cet vatican city , italy
[546/1000]	" she did , " i said . " but it 's been over a week . i 've been writing for weeks . " edward gave me a dead - on look . " i already know you
[547/1000]	" yes , sir , " the guard said . " you 'll let me in ? " the guard said , still keeping his voice down . the door opened , and three men emerged . one
[548/1000]	" because i like it like that , " he whispered against the satin of her br * * sts , which looked so sexy beneath the black lace . " but no pressure , " he added in a
[549/1000]	i frowned and pulled against the handcuffs , my hand finally relaxing enough to break free . " why ? why do i owe you a job ? " she shrugged , leaning over my chair and resting her
[550/1000]	she saw it , saw it flashing out of the corner of her eye at her this woman was staring at , saw it with her , then then saw it out of the corner of her eye . something
[551/1000]	she did feel bad about kicking him , although the worst part was that he seemed to really enjoy taunting her . " you did n't know i 'd kick you ? " she felt her irritation rise .
[552/1000]	" i 'll drive you home , " i said to his father . " thanks , son . it was nice meeting you . " without another word , he picked up the phone . my
[553/1000]	or maybe that 's just the alcohol . " i think she wants to keep this night on record , " ethan says , watching the moment unfold . i glance over at him . " you want
[554/1000]	' we 're not <EOS> ... we - ' rincewind , this is not at all . ' where are you standing at the bottom of a river that 's full of caves ? ' he 's above
[555/1000]	" good . thanks dad . let 's go and play . " dad nods and motions me towards his suv . " you 're on your own , bud . i got things i need to take care
[556/1000]	" i mean we both know how much you love your career and then some . " she leans forward to rub my arm . i flinch at her touch and stand carefully , moving away from her .
[557/1000]	" i 'll just be waiting for your call . " " you make it sound so easy , " he said bitterly . " what ? " " i 'm not your boyfriend . and you
[558/1000]	" we are n't in kansas anymore , " i said . " oh . " he had n't been to kansas . " well , that explains the cold . " he seemed genuinely unsure how to
[559/1000]	" like i said , a very nice , tall , good looking gentleman would be a boon to your complexion , and it might serve too well on our future alliance . " now he found the words even
[560/1000]	" do n't be silly . of course we 'll make love , " she laughed , " absolutely , " and lay her head down on his chest . " it will be wonderful . no matter what happens
[561/1000]	oh , god , it turned into a nightmare as i tried to figure out how to make contact with him . did he believe me when i said the place was on fire . and so a couple
[562/1000]	" the police will handle it , " said detective sch mid t . " no , they wo n't , " said raymond , and he sounded like he really believed it . but he was n't even
[563/1000]	* * * there was a flurry of activity a few minutes after the ring with a few other players , probably preparing for the next round . " the ladies ' room would be a lovely place
[564/1000]	" have you ever fired ? " " no . i 've never shot anywhere with a gun . " " you 'll be just fine . in a couple of hours , i 'll pay people to
[565/1000]	his eyes blazed again , but this time they blazed with desire . yeah , like she 'd be able to ignore the smoldering part of her that wanted nothing more than to jump up and take him into
[566/1000]	" all right . there you go . i wo n't say a word . " " there is a lady here who would n't mind talking to you . " " who ? " " your
[567/1000]	he said , " then tell me no , and i 'll understand . " " no . we 're not partners . " " please . i gave you my word that i 'd never touch you
[568/1000]	" no . " she nodded . i still did n't think you should get in touch with the council like that ; the council would either never allow you if you were killed , or they would ,
[569/1000]	" at least wait until the doctor comes in to get you ? " " right . she said she could stand to bring you water but she can wait a couple more hours . " he was
[570/1000]	" i thought it would not matter . but , uh , you may have done better to read a few pages of ' your own eyes ' before this all happened . " his face blanched .
[571/1000]	" what ? " she asked suddenly . he pressed a kiss over a spot on her neck . " i love the way you taste , " he replied against her skin . " right now , i
[572/1000]	" what 's it supposed to do ? " " make people like you . " " the others believe all vampires are beautiful and strong and do n't feel regret , " he said , and i
[573/1000]	there was n't a sound . was she dead ? he reached out for her , but she vanished from his grasp . he fought , but even as fury raged through him , he knew too well how
[574/1000]	" i do n't think that there is a very good word for it , professor pa vlo vich . a simple " hello " or " good to see " and " good to see you " is probably
[575/1000]	" hi , everyone . " he stood at the foot of the bed and grinned down at olivia . he felt bad for making her wait . once she started talking , she would n't stop until the last
[576/1000]	i look over at him to see if he 's having the same doubts or if he 's the only person here who has n't developed the ability . " all of you . " * * *
[577/1000]	and i want him . no , i need to be with him . " ethan is sick , " i inform ethan . " because he 's taking the flu . the problem is that he has a
[578/1000]	" what are you doing here ? " i asked . " i had a little time to think and i needed to get away from all the crap that 's been happening around town . " i
[579/1000]	there are fewer people in the garden now and i feel safe with my new friends . i think someone is listening , although it 's hard to tell . the night wind howls through the trees . i reach
[580/1000]	" to be fair , if ' tis the truth , i 'm the one who got it wrong . we 're talking rather simple differences . " " was it the same as when we first met ?
[581/1000]	' my mother thinks i 'm insane . she told me once that if i did n't get my act together soon you 'd never forgive me . ' ' but there were a lot of reasons why .
[582/1000]	" there are no wolves around me , " she says . " it 's the wrong place . " for some reason , my voice comes out a little bit sharper than i 'd hoped . " you
[583/1000]	" it 's time for me to go , " i said , standing . as i pulled out of the building i heard more barking , one by one . my spirits were rising as i crossed the street
[584/1000]	all right , what was the point in trying to hide it now , of course ? let 's just see how long it takes us to figure out a way around the power and the power and all that
[585/1000]	" no , i 'm not , " ryan admitted , then added , " can i smoke ? " " hell no , " joe told him , and shot a questioning glance at holly , but she
[586/1000]	but this time , i was n't just seeing sam <EOS> this time , i was seeing sam being sam , even in the light of day . i had to take my eyes off him before i could
[587/1000]	" he does have a point . we wo n't know until friday . " " how long will you sleep tonight ? " " i 'll be fine . " " would you ... "
[588/1000]	do n't ask me , i tell myself . this is the same guy who gave me the night off , the guy who thought of my own desires in such a way . but now , i 've given
[589/1000]	but she was n't his type . he just could n't seem to look at her anymore without getting the urge to pull her under him and make out with her to see if her body responded as well ,
[590/1000]	and then , one day as i was changing clothes and the doorbell rang , grace called out to me from the front yard . " look , it 's grace ! " she cried . at the
[591/1000]	" it 's my fault . " he thought she was the bad guy and she was just being pissy to appease him . " that 's ok , i 'll take a new one . " "
[592/1000]	" you 're the only one who can give me a smile , " she said , kissing me on the cheek . " so what 's next ? " " you asked , " i said , moving
[593/1000]	" fuck ! " chapter 4 chapter 5 chapter 6 chapter 7 chapter 8 chapter 9 chapter 10 chapter 11 chapter 12 chapter 13 chapter 14 chapter 15
[594/1000]	on our way back into the compound to get some sleep , finn said , " why do you trust finn ? " i shrugged . why the hell not ? no wonder i trusted him . "
[595/1000]	" i would really like to be more of that in your life , " he said . i tried to smile . he reached out and took my hand . when he pulled it from his jeans pocket
[596/1000]	she had a bit of a laugh as she said , " one day , you might have to take me up on the offer . " i was confused . " what offer ? " " it
[597/1000]	" did you have a bad night ? a lot ? " " yeah . i went to the back door and called 911 , but they 're waiting for backup . i have to get out of here
[598/1000]	" you 're still here , " i said , looking back over my shoulder . <EOS> with sam . the image flickered and then shot into my mind : a wolf , a wolf , a wolf , a
[599/1000]	" come on , let 's go back to my place . i 've made your best friend 's birthday cake and you promised me you 'd make it . " rae felt warm and fuzzy inside , despite
[600/1000]	" it may . once he gives me some instruction and i 'm ready to go , i 'll make our plans . and after everything that 's happened so far , i do n't want any kind of mess
[601/1000]	" i might have to leave him up there alone . the way those guys would look at him , they 'd probably think he killed someone and they probably would n't appreciate his lack of morals . but my
[602/1000]	i thought again of my trip to the woods , the first time i 'd actually lost my virginity to a boy , and i took a moment to think how funny it would feel to have my eyes roll
[603/1000]	" yeah , " said frank , " i think so . i need to be back at the university in a few days . i need to find out more about what kind of chemical is involved . it
[604/1000]	not the point ! his hands were shaking . no point ! there was a knock at his door . " just a sec , man , " mike said . " mike ? " " just
[605/1000]	" she 's not going to the library tonight , am i right ? " " no . i 'm at my parents ' with max and charlie . it 's all packed out . " " i
[606/1000]	" really , " i said , and kissed her cheek . " not too complicated . " " i need to find a shrink , " she said . " you think ? " her mouth
[607/1000]	" yes , sir . " " great . can you call your own security ? " " yes , sir , " came the reply . " have them send down the guy 's identification .
[608/1000]	on the top of the hill were the houses the soldiers had seen , but of course , the ground was covered with dirt and there were n't many . " they could have gone all the way to
[609/1000]	" are you a prostitute or something ? " " no , " he assured her . " there are the perks of a very close friendship . " damn . he had not only agreed to meet
[610/1000]	" you 've had the dream lately , " anna said worriedly . i nodded . " because it 's the same thing , but i ca n't make any sense of it with the dream casting going
[611/1000]	" i 'm fine , " i murmur , and i want to fall asleep in his arms . " i think i 'm just tired . " " are your keys in your purse ? " nic asks
[612/1000]	" what 's that ? " " an oath . and it 's a long , boring one . it 's a vow . " " i never took it . " if she said it out loud
[613/1000]	" we have to talk . " chapter thirty - nine in the distance , a crash sounded , with bits of concrete flying and clanging against the ground . sarah winced at the cacophony , which
[614/1000]	" it 's not like that to you , " i said . could n't i just go , get out of this ? " if they can show it to you ... " this got his attention .
[615/1000]	just when she thought things could n't get worse , she found him reading in the kitchen . his long dark hair , those mesmerizing electric blue eyes , the taut muscles in his shoulders , those strong hands
[616/1000]	she was n't an arrogant man , and her willingness to please him was something he 'd craved for a long time . her ability to not only talk to people was an aphrodisiac . still , she was
[617/1000]	" we wo n't , " i say hurriedly and close my eyes . i feel the familiar and reassuring pressure of my watch as i check out the watch and feel the time slow down another notch .
[618/1000]	" i do n't know what happened , but i did n't come here to have fun . i came here because i cared . that has n't changed . i saw you . it 's not change . "
[619/1000]	what the hell was he doing ? when it became clear that he was n't going to listen any more , she rolled onto her back , and did the same thing he did to her . maybe
[620/1000]	" it was hard , " he rasped , his face softening with regret . " this way i feel like i 'm missing the mark , too . " " no one ever told me women got hurt
[621/1000]	" what would we have to do to get them to cooperate ? " he asked . " we could tell them we do n't know what is inside the lab , " she said . " then they
[622/1000]	" how were you ? " adam asked . i glanced at him . " uh , good . did you 've been sleeping well ? " " no , thank god . " i nodded .
[623/1000]	she was doing a damned good job of it . all her steps were a smooth glide , like a pro . she was close enough to see a small bulge in the front of those khaki pants ,

[625/1000]	" thank you . " she said the words quietly , but he could tell she meant them . " not a word more , " he said . then turned and strode over to the big door without
[626/1000]	but he could n't - and could n't - say . he swallowed , trying to make his chest work in order to suck some air into his lungs . hell , he was never never in this kind
[627/1000]	" i was fine , sam , " i stammered . i tried again , pulling away from his firm warmth . it was so wrong . i stepped forward and rubbed at my eyes . i could n't bring
[628/1000]	" we saw you come in the door . we 've been watching television , " said kevin . " what time is it ? " i asked . " almost four . " " what about
[629/1000]	and that 's when she started to cry deeply and very very hard . he rubbed her back as she wept . after a long while , she rolled off him and drew her knees to her chest . she
[630/1000]	he had been as honest with her . " i ca n't really say . you 're too young to understand why he threw me out of the house . " " it 's not a surprise that he
[631/1000]	" did you see the picture ? " " yes . " " on the cover , " she clarified . " i was surprised by how young he could be . i had n't thought he was
[632/1000]	" i wo n't lie to you and i guess i do n't know what it is that you wo n't tell me . so tell me . " " i have n't told anyone . " "
[633/1000]	" i 'll say . they wo n't hold him for long , and the man is too big to really sink him , let alone do him much good . give him a break . <EOS> too far away
[634/1000]	' i do n't see how they could know what you 're up to . ' ' my friend is a collector , that 's all . there is n't even a painting or collection of old masters around
[635/1000]	" i knew you were a big city girl . " " i guess that 's what i thought . " michael laughed . " i feel like a rock star , playing dress in the crowd on
[636/1000]	" that 's not what i meant . i could feel a heat inside you . you would n't have been upset , would you ? " i feel a shudder go down my spine , even as i
[637/1000]	" i 'm sorry about everything that 's happened , " aria whispered . " but i wo n't kill you . " " what you have to do , " emily whispered , " is stay away from
[638/1000]	" the car is outside , " i said . i kept walking . she followed , and we watched our prey go outside . her car , which was old , was parked in front of the store .
[639/1000]	" not likely , " he said and took its place in the circle , placing its head in his hands . " you 're not one to back down from a challenge . " i thought , "
[640/1000]	" yes . " " on the table . and you 've had no meals either . i think you 've been too busy studying . " she nodded . " my professor 's letter had more than
[641/1000]	i waited , thinking . just wait . he 'd been willing to work with me , despite my initial threat the day when alex 's boyfriend showed up to shoot him . the one thing i could
[642/1000]	he chuckled , and then he grabbed my h * ps and hauled me down onto him . he pushed into me again and again until he had <EOS> right to reach a full life . that was so
[643/1000]	" here , let me get it for you , " said the man , stepping closer to the counter . we held it against our chests and looked at each other in confusion . " i 'll
[644/1000]	" but he 's dead , " said the young woman . everyone looked at her , aghast , and then her eyes lit up and her mind flashed to the phone . " oh , you mean your
[645/1000]	' well , you did the right thing telling me about it , ' he admitted , looking at me as if i 'd just confessed i 'd won a lottery . shaking my head slightly , i held
[646/1000]	he raised an eyebrow and he knew it . " never mind , " she said as she moved off the coffee table to stand beside the door where she could look out . " if everything smells good
[647/1000]	" sure . " they headed to the nearest mall , the mall where they 'd meet noah . they needed to make her look good in front of noah , so the boy would see that she was
[648/1000]	the women waited , the two men at the end of the ring talking . " i ca n't believe you did n't tell her before . " paul held onto rose 's hand , his skin still warm
[649/1000]	" i thought i heard mrs. billings ' voice from here ! is something wrong ? " a maid wearing a green velvet cloak and bearing a tray of pastries was in the midst of opening a door at the
[650/1000]	" well ? " he asked , his voice harsh . " yes . there may indeed be still time . " she could hardly think straight when she was so damn conflicted . even for his benefit .
[651/1000]	" you 're right - it could at least open up a bit ! we all want a look at that one ! " and with that , we all rose and hurried into the alley , where we
[652/1000]	i felt the heat of her tongue against my neck . i closed my eyes and took a deep breath , holding it because i was n't sure what was happening or where my emotions were going . what if
[653/1000]	" i remember not being very good friends with him but i 'm pretty great friends with you , " amy said . " are we still on for dinner tonight ? " " yes , how did you
[654/1000]	" wait a minute , " the woman continued . " the old woman ? your guardian angel ? " the others ignored her . " i mean ... she said she 'd be with us ... forever
[655/1000]	" i 'm pretty sure i did some drugs when i was younger , but i did n't do a lot of things . " i said , thinking back , i 'd been in one place , but i
[656/1000]	" well , i never , " i growled , and she winced . i took a shuddering breath . " i meant it . " " i know you did . what 's the matter ? "
[657/1000]	" can i wear that blouse <EOS> or a long hair over them a little ? should see just plain old - " he thought aloud . " wait until you put those girls ? what is n't she there
[658/1000]	he seemed to be in a good mood now that he 'd made his decision to go to bed with me . he looked away from me and out the patio door at the ocean . i wondered if he
[659/1000]	which meant ... if she was a goddess ... how did she go from an old demon to an immortal child ? maybe she was immune to the demons ' powers . some of them might end up
[660/1000]	" okay -- " meredith trailed off with an exasperated sigh . " okay , what ? " max asked , taking a few cautious steps toward them . meredith quickly grabbed a throw blanket from the couch
[661/1000]	she looked up at me , a little pale , still as a statue . " are ... are you okay ? " " i might be . " i looked away , then back . " did you
[662/1000]	" only one thing ; i 'm dying to know if you 're married ? " " no . " " who married who ? me ? " " no ! " " do n't act
[663/1000]	" you were here an hour ago . you say you 're satisfied with the case against you ? " " there was no evidence i was ever present , " he muttered . " then your wife
[664/1000]	but was she really that good ? and what was she going to do after that ? after the fire ? his hand settled lightly on the arch of her back . she felt the rough press of
[665/1000]	his mother nodded . " i 'm guessing that 's why you were hanging around at the house ; you figured you could get on my mom 's good side . " " no , he was always there
[666/1000]	" <EOS> " for all three . " " oh , i agree . <EOS> that 's all , " i said . i did n't want to think about it . but i did n't have many choices
[667/1000]	" how 's my fiancee ? " asked the blonde as she stepped into the room . katherine recognized katherine 's blonde hair and tall , confident sister as well as her brilliant smile . katherine 's eyes
[668/1000]	he laughed easily . " yes , i do . you can see all the evidence - the fingerprints alone - but you ca n't prove it . " " oh , believe me , i 've seen it
[669/1000]	ethan nodded . " but i will not turn my back on you , you little shit . " her hands flew to his face , her fingers digging hard into his skin . her mouth twisted into a
[670/1000]	" well , there 's no need for you to decide right now about tomorrow when you ca n't do it today anyway . that way we can have some time to think of our conversation and not start building
[671/1000]	" yeah , " i confessed . " and not because i was on the receiving end of the same kind of cold and calculated looks from you when you tried to break it off with them , but because
[672/1000]	i rolled my eyes at him but kept glaring when he answered . " yep , they got a place to live . you like ? " " that 's a great town . " " you
[673/1000]	' what are you hiding ? ' she knew what she was hiding , as well as she knew exactly how he made her feel . the knowledge made her skin tingle . ' i have hidden nothing from
[674/1000]	" i thought we 'd start with some conversation . maybe we could try this tomorrow . " " there is n't anything to talk about over dinner . " " i 'm not that bad . "
[675/1000]	" oh . " i bit my lip , lost in his chocolate eyes . " and right where 's the restroom ? " he tilted his head to the side . i looked around , trying to
[676/1000]	' i could feel a chill pass over me , ' said william . ' it would be hard to explain . not because i was cold , i 'm just ... i 'm sure it 's nothing . they
[677/1000]	" i 've got to go . i need to pick up my friends from the party . " " i 'll wait here and i 'll drive you home , " he said . " i do
[678/1000]	" what 's it mean ? " " it means he loves you , " john said . " and he wo n't let me die without telling you . " she nodded and buried her face in
[679/1000]	it was a year since the funeral . three years since i had had this talk with my dad . my life had always been a hard , chaotic one , and it had always been rough .
[680/1000]	" i saw . " riley grinned . " i 'm sure they 're making plans to change the whole thing . " she studied him . " do you want to watch a movie or something ? you
[681/1000]	" you do n't see us ! " " look , she did not come here , but you must believe that she did . i know you think her to be a liar . but this is not
[682/1000]	' you 've been giving the people all the wrong impression , ' he said . ' it 's in the nature of - ' ' the nature of what ? ' said moist . ' the
[683/1000]	" what 's going on ? " " you 're right . i have to go ! " nick 's face said he did n't believe she would do that . " wait ! you do n't realize
[684/1000]	" my guess is you do n't like to visit your friends in the hamp tons , " i tease , and then i 'm sorry when she starts to cry . " oh god , that hurts . "
[685/1000]	she jumped . " hey . that was rude . " " no . that was good , too . " she smiled sheepishly , trying to cover her gaf fe . i had no idea how to
[686/1000]	" thank you . " i closed my eyes , taking in a deep breath of fresh air . it was n't like there was anyone else here . i felt something for the first time in my
[687/1000]	she had n't planned it . that night during the dance as they had set up for the rehearsal , and before the end of the rehearsal as the girls were making the popcorn and eating the food at the
[688/1000]	" why would you say that ? " " because i see him whenever i walk in the courtroom . you and i could be good friends ; you are the best employee i 've ever had ! i
[689/1000]	" you want me to show you around the place ? " " i only want to know what you think about it , and to make sure it 's as interesting as it will become . "
[690/1000]	" how did you ask the professor ? " the prince asked . " he asked me . that 's what he did . he asked me because the prince told him they were going back to the castle
[691/1000]	i knew , no matter what i tried to do , i would find that i could not . i knew that i did it to save myself , to save a man who deserved to be dead , and
[692/1000]	there was a crack of thunder out of the west and the cloud of locu sts that were nesting in the branches of the pecan tree overhead began to move . the trees around the ranch were shaking violently

[696/1000]	<EOS> i turned it until it was facing me , like i could force it to work , maybe use its spell or shield , just to be sure . it worked , but the spell caught fire and
[697/1000]	" no , i mean i just realize i have n't answered any of your questions . i probably ca n't remember a lot of the answers , are you sure that information about hiv ca n't be given in
[698/1000]	that was when he realized just how much cash he was paying her , and it made him even more angry . if he was going to be responsible for something more difficult than a child 's clothes - and
[699/1000]	" hey there , you guys . " he had a serious air about him as he strode up , then shook hands with each of them while he chatted . " i got some bad news . "
[700/1000]	" it 's a game they play , " she told my father , in what she hoped was a cool voice . " we 're playing a competition for <EOS> , all sorts of wild horses , and everybody
[701/1000]	" do n't bother , " he told her . " i know anyway . i have pictures . i printed them out for you . " " thank you . " " do n't thank me ,
[702/1000]	my eyes rolled in my head , and i groaned . " look at you being dirty . " " yes , sir . " i bit my lip and reached out to put my hand on his
[703/1000]	" i 'm not here to make you stay , " he said , " and you know where you can find me . " " i know about sam . i can smell the blood . even from
[704/1000]	" why so ? " " because you need me ! " " i need you , too - " she cut me off . " we have to work together , cole . this is important
[705/1000]	" yeah . " i whispered . " he has n't been very nice . " " does he know it 's you ? " i winced , remembering my humiliating admission . he continued , " that what
[706/1000]	" how does that work ? " they both looked at me in unison , ready for a lecture . " it makes them think you are the president . " the woman responded a bit too coldly .
[707/1000]	" i ca n't believe you 're lying to me . " " i 'm not lying . " " did that make you feel better ? " " no . " " why not ?
[708/1000]	as i pull the trigger the girl 's body becomes limp . the girl 's head rolls over , and i can see her face . she was a girl . i hear the metallic clatter of something hitting the
[709/1000]	i took a deep breath before calling my cousin . " you know you 're supposed to tell me so you know how i feel . so tell me right now why the hell did this happen ? why had
[710/1000]	" damn right . i 've been waitin ' for you forever . " she swallowed hard . " and we 've always had this special connection - nothing that 's ever had anything to do with me
[711/1000]	i turned to seth , watching as he crossed his arms . his bright - blue eyes were wary ; the worry that i 'd seen before now was showing on his face . the dark circles beneath his bloodshot
[712/1000]	but most of all he hated having no way of making sure his job as a director did for him . " <EOS> that will never come into the kitchen , not ever having a thing , and never going

[715/1000]	" and since his father disappeared and the kids are missing , he 'll get nothing but the shitty jobs . " if anyone took away her opportunity at the university without her knowledge , it 'd be scott .
[716/1000]	" he did n't feel a thing . i do n't think you need to worry about him . he 's too smart for that . besides , his death 's not your fault . " " no ,
[717/1000]	" go and get that , " i told him . his hands reached out and he touched my face softly , not enough to be a peck , but it was close enough to touch . he gave

[719/1000]	" where 's my cousin ? " a pair of hands squeezed around my waist , and i looked up . " well you do n't ask . you follow ? " shane pulled me back against him and pulled

[722/1000]	" really , really badly , but i feel like it matters . i do n't think they are quite ready ... " " she will , " he said as he leaned back in the chair and sighed
[723/1000]	once he was gone , she turned her attention to the painting that hung over the mantel , the one of the woman with the green - stained eyes . the woman who , as elena 's mother had said
[724/1000]	i 'd love to see you . well , you have time for that , but at least you 've got me . i understand why they did n't want you around . but that does n't mean anything .
[725/1000]	jake 's eyes are still open , staring at the ceiling . and for the last three hours i 've been telling him everything . about my dad , about my crazy mom , about my stalker sister and what

[728/1000]	they followed his voice . " where are you going ? " asked jack . it was evident that this was his last chance to speak to the fellow , and it seemed to give him one last opportunity
[729/1000]	" if you did n't make it to another state , where are you going to live now that you 're still a human ? " " i 'm really not looking forward to moving again . you know
[730/1000]	" i do n't care if you do , " he said . " because i know i ca n't stay here . " " no , because you 're not leaving . will you at least come

[737/1000]	i took a deep breath and looked over to see the woman i loved staring back at me . " the only thing left to do is go home , go to school , and be the same as always
[738/1000]	" what 's going on out there ? " the stranger asked . the stranger 's voice sounded strange and somewhat hostile . he approached quietly , his blue face was drawn and looked tired and haggard . "
[739/1000]	" i think he was actually taking an interest in me , " i said . she turned to him . " what do you mean ? " " all those guys at the table had crushes on

[743/1000]	" what 's that supposed to mean ? " his voice was angry . " <EOS> ... is n't it fun , seems to throw a secret , and then the way i had been a terrible love ...
[744/1000]	" it would n't be hard to get them to join . " she smiled at him and looked directly into his eyes before continuing . " i do like playing chess , though , and my parents have always
[745/1000]	a gust of wind blew for a moment , bringing with it the stench of gunpowder and fresh blood . " are you all right ? " i called . jamie had drawn down his own dirk and was
[746/1000]	" the house is good though , " daniel says as he takes off his glasses and scratches his face . " i 'm glad to see you got it . thanks for taking care of it . "
[747/1000]	she shook her head , trying to sort out what he 'd lied about . the only way she could find any more answers would be to try and take him back to her car . she needed to be
[748/1000]	" who are you ? " he asked . " who are you ? " i repeated . " who are you to me ? " he repeated back . " i said who i was !

[855/1000]	to my surprise , he takes my hand . he continues as we walk , pulling me along after him . " i like your kitchen , " i tell him . " i should leave it at that
[856/1000]	" you were out there tonight ! " she yelled again . " and as a matter of fact i know exactly where i was and where i woke up all alone , " he said . just

[900/1000]	with a final word of thank you , i made my way down the hall , toward what i hoped was the second elevator . i paused on the third floor to check myself in the mirror . i
[901/1000]	her mind swam with all the options left at the scene of the shooting , and she 'd already checked all of the other things she 'd made . she had to concentrate to keep from going crazy .
[902/1000]	this whole thing makes sense now . i know this is n't as easy as everything that happened after i came back . you never came home . " i do n't want anything to do with him anymore
[903/1000]	i nod at the ground before stepping down onto the ground . " the girls ' dorm is down the street . " " okay , do you have a little time to drive down with me ? "
[904/1000]	" why do n't you sit down ? give me some time to explain . " we walked over to the old oak trees beside the stream . there was a large oak over here , but its branches
[905/1000]	the moment my fingers encountered his smooth skin i knew i was crazy about him , but i just could n't seem to stop myself from reaching out to touch him . " i 'm not sure it was
[906/1000]	the next time he tried to come into my life , i tried not to let it happen again . it was hard . this time he could n't kiss me . nor could he come into the
[907/1000]	" why does it have to be all in french ? " " we 're a sort of team . " he shrugged . " the king of france is trying to get her head back together . "
[908/1000]	he dropped more strawberries into her bowl . " but what the hell happened to you ? " " i was alone , " she said simply . " the woman is a walking ghost . "
[909/1000]	" what are you up to ? " " never mind that . " " let 's just keep walking . you do n't want to catch any more flies tonight , do you ? " "
[910/1000]	all except for the sound of his heart . his chest tightened , threatening to spill up with the bile that threatened to erupt in his throat . the light in the hallway was dim , but he knew
[911/1000]	" he does the same thing . and on sunday , monday , wednesday and tuesday , the state cops raided my house , hoping to find something that will show up as a clue , " i say .
[912/1000]	he nodded . " she has no love for me either . i am not happy with what we are , whether it 's from her friend 's problems , him with the war , her mother 's disease or
[913/1000]	i wanted to speak , to tell him what - what we 'd done - but did n't know what to say . i knew , because i had n't said it , because my face was blazing hot .
[914/1000]	" you 're not afraid , are you ? " i asked . i went into the living room and saw my friend , my brother , and his dog and his baby girl . " no ,
[915/1000]	he opened the passenger 's door and rolled down the window a split second later . " you 're a f * * kin ' bitch , " he declared , his voice vibrating dangerously with the barely repressed
[916/1000]	the next morning , grace woke up to find herself lying in the narrow room that she had shared with her mother for years . she felt light - headed , as if she were drinking strong tea , and
[917/1000]	" you 're no human , kate , " david said . " what . " " humans are no god . " kate felt heat rise in her face . " what does that mean ?
[918/1000]	all the time there was a moment where she felt helpless and stupid and not , in the end , worthy of a good cry , but she forced herself to put the gun down and draw out three more
[919/1000]	' thanks and that makes it all better , ' said ridcully , sitting down and adjusting his glass . ' then what 's the bloody great trick for using a spell to make that young spell . what in
[920/1000]	and ... what did it mean , right before he 'd gotten a kiss from her ... " kiss me , " she whispered and curled her fingers around his . he 'd given her a kiss .
[921/1000]	but at that moment , his entire world went completely still . even his heart stopped . that 's why he would die . chapter 20 " you ca n't marry a demon . "
[922/1000]	" what was the point ? nothing would benefit me now , " he said . " not even what you think might , anyway . " " a person might not . if i was going to kill
[923/1000]	" please tell me that you 're not having another heart attack , " he said , pulling his phone from his pocket and dialing . it rang two times before i heard sam 's voice . " hi
[924/1000]	even as the words crossed her mind , she did n't regret breaking the rules , not even a little bit . not when she loved him and knew she would spend all the rest of her life with him
[925/1000]	there was none on the elevator , because he could n't use the lift . his hands shook as he took his cell phone out of his pocket and punched in mark 's number . the door dinged and
[926/1000]	" i ca n't think of anything that would be better than that . " i felt a tear slide down my cheek . " i 'd love to make a great mom to your niece . " he
[927/1000]	though no one thought much of the ' young white and dark - haired red - haired boy in their midst , i knew immediately why his hand was shaking . now if we waited until no one was watching
[928/1000]	" is this good ? " " mm hmm . " i pushed my body up like he 'd commanded and brought my hands to the sides of his head . moving him in at my chest ,
[929/1000]	they moved faster , passing a group of three men on horseback about half way down the street . two of them wore swords at their belts , while the other two wore the standard of the church on their
[930/1000]	" all right , alright , " he said and got to his feet . she laughed at the sight of him standing there and waved . she just kept smiling at him . " this is n't
[931/1000]	" no , " said sarah . " we 're fine . i 'm not coming back here . " " you 're a good liar , sarah , " said candi . " i do n't take that
[932/1000]	" he 's on in a half an hour . i have to start putting my stuff in the truck and going to church to get my clothes packed for you . " " is he all right ?
[933/1000]	" you look out for me , " he said . " maybe you 're too young for me , but you could be like me , some day . i would be a good husband , and a father
[934/1000]	" i was n't able to come up with better reason to bring you here than you 'd given me , " he said , as if he was proud of himself . " there 's more to this life
[935/1000]	" what is it ? " " i do n't know . " i swallowed thickly . " you feel ... a little ... won ky , " she murmured , then paused , her eyes snapping wide
[936/1000]	" i 'll take off as soon as we finish . i might want to get rid of some of this furniture , too . you 'd feel better if there was support for that . " emma made
[937/1000]	" i always suspected you were behind a few scenes . " " well , now i know you are , and you 'd be right . that 's how i could get rich off watching too many television
[938/1000]	" how ? " i ask , trying to keep things light . he looks around . " how , could we help you figure it out ? " " well ! " i say , trying to
[939/1000]	" how about i take you outside ? " she did n't answer right away , but she pulled his arm around her shoulder and gave him a little push to get him out of the store . "
[940/1000]	" you know about the last time he was here ? " " of course , " i whisper . " is he okay ? " " why do n't you ask him yourself ? " kate shrugs
[941/1000]	the guy was a real loser , no doubt . but you could n't have everything in life ; this guy could have even more than i 'd had coming to him a few months ago . hell , who
[942/1000]	they ended up on the balcony , in the first room on the right , behind a closed door . they were in three of the big bedroom suites and each had its own bathroom with a whirlpool tub
[943/1000]	" you did indeed . i ca n't believe i nearly let you beat me . i can not believe i let you pin me with that crossbow . " " does it not bother you when i threaten
[944/1000]	" yes , " she said , " and i appreciate it . " then she stood and walked out of the room with nothing to say . behind her , as she went down the hallway , she
[945/1000]	" have n't slept since you saw me last . " his mouth curved . " after she called me , i said i wanted a chance to talk with you . " " oh , yeah ? "
[946/1000]	" no thanks , i 'm good , " he said , and ran his hand through his hair . then he smiled . " but if the last item on your checklist is a kiss you have to give
[947/1000]	" oh , they do n't have enough alcohol , " she responded with a chuckle . " it only works four weeks for each person . " " well then , if this works , i 'll get
[948/1000]	" no , that we do n't . i love it , but when your mom and i decided to move into the house -- " " i know , i know . the thing is , i do
[949/1000]	" he 's asking you a question . i 'm the only one who can answer for him . " it took a long time , but he finally came back to the real truth of the matter .
[950/1000]	" now , my lord of lar edo , " kal are began again , " what i would like to say is that - " " go on , " ver in said . " these troubles
[951/1000]	she was in the habit of checking her phone as she 'd done nearly every day since she 'd returned from china . she was n't surprised when it was n't a message . it was a message from a
[952/1000]	" i have not told him anything yet . " " not yet . he needs you to cooperate with him in whatever he can do to prove you innocent . " she rubbed at her eyes with
[953/1000]	" that takes some feeling out of me . " he chuckled at the description of his sister . she 'd been the one to pull his hair during a game of basketball . " you 're not funny
[954/1000]	" did he hurt you ? " she gasped . she never thought about that , not as a question , not as a statement , not as a statement . she heard the word , but it was
[955/1000]	" that they were . " his voice was as soft as the breeze outside . what did that say about me ? i was n't as naive as i thought i was , because what he 'd
[956/1000]	" no . but his son has two , and when the boy dies he 's to have a brother , and he takes extra care not to take any risks . " " he 's a vampire ,
[957/1000]	" he 's just lonely , " emma said . " he 's lonely all the time , and now he 's alone , " claire said . " you ca n't blame him for wanting to believe something
[958/1000]	" when , exactly , did we talk first ? " " when you got here . " " where ? " " that 's all you need to know . " " where are you
[959/1000]	" but what about her ? " " her ? what about her ? " " so what ? " " so she 'll have a kid first . " " what ? " "
[960/1000]	" sure thing ! i got a couple of tickets . " alex looked at his watch . " i ca n't believe we still have a few hours before lunch . " " yeah , and i 'm
[961/1000]	" are you all right ? " " you 're asking me if i 'm okay ? " i grabbed the glass of milk and took a long swallow . it was really sweet . " yeah .
[962/1000]	she stepped forward , grabbed his shoulders and spun him back around to face her . she was surprised by the sudden desperation in his eyes . she had to close them all to try and look away .
[963/1000]	" that was fun , was n't it ? " " uh - huh . " " what was your first thought when you woke up ? " " which one ? " " would you
[964/1000]	" the lady from my day ... she says she 's the prettiest woman near us , and that she 's come with three children , her son , " he said , not letting on , " the daughter
[965/1000]	" you want to come keep ? " " no . " he shifted <EOS> - something is , he 'd never really put out , but it was a game . " <EOS> i 'm a little more
[966/1000]	she shook her head . " it 's a long story ? " " let 's just say i 've been told more about your grandfather than i want to . " " how can he do anything
[967/1000]	" did you really think my best friend would be the target of all this ? that i would n't go after him once i was clear of town ? " his eyes darted around the restaurant . "
[968/1000]	" you 'll remember him ? " the eyes of the professor studied his face and said nothing , but then a small smile played at the corners of his mouth and he leaned back into his chair .
[969/1000]	" not a problem , " said his brother . " the question is , does it have to involve my brother ? " " have you got any better ideas ? " " not really ,
[970/1000]	he nodded once in response . " i get it . let 's go . " they followed her down the hallway toward the staircase . " ready ? " " ready when you are . "
[971/1000]	" i 'll have my car , " said my mother . " i 'll call your boyfriend , then . " he punched in some numbers on his phone . " get yourself out of town for a
[972/1000]	that had to be it . another wave of agony hit her and she clutched at his arm as she tried to breathe through the agonizing pain . she was going to die ... " please ... "
[973/1000]	" is this the guy ? " his gaze drifted to her chest . " it might be . " she stared sight lessly around the parking garage . " i know he 's really mad . he
[974/1000]	" fuck you . " he slammed the door with a curse , making the sound loud , even through the car glass . it was a bad idea . he 'd be sure to let tate know before he
[975/1000]	" of course . " it was the best she could do under the circumstances . " so this man who comes on board the ship - with me , i mean - his name is george george .
[976/1000]	but i ca n't talk right now . i ca n't deal . " rachel stands and watches me leave the study , her face a mask of sadness . she knows . " why ca n't i ...
[977/1000]	the next morning i took four classes from <EOS> the same four courses that i had to do a few extra classes from a well with an imaginary knife . the kids watched me walk towards mr. walsh . i
[978/1000]	" i will . " the dark witch would do as she was told without question or hesitation . the pain inside did n't disappear that easily with a vampire who seemed determined to follow his orders .
[979/1000]	he 's trying to tell me something ! she thought . who in the heck is this idiot ? is he part pirate ? so why does he think i 'm a pirate ? finally she looked up
[980/1000]	the boy stood up , moved the edge of the tree into the tree with a grunt and the same kind of grunt as he had when climbing . " you are n't doing it right ! " the
[981/1000]	" yes baby , " said a voice in front of me . " i have seen it many times . " i turned to see someone i believed we all knew all too well . chapter two
[982/1000]	without another word , he headed toward his car and pulled his hat from his shoulders . " just let me go , " sam said when he returned , his eyes on the house . " i 've
[983/1000]	his gaze swung from her to the floor , then moved upward to meet my eyes . he gave a short nod and mouthed , " okay . " thank goodness . five in the car ,
[984/1000]	" if she is a spy for him , we will crush her and take away any secrets she might have . ' ' i would take her away with us , my dearest , ' said the little
[985/1000]	" of course ! i could not imagine why it would not bother you . in fact ... wait ... it was because you were close , in a way . " i stiffened at his explanation , then
[986/1000]	" i really do think they need to know what happened and is the right way to handle it , " said shadow , " but with as much of a head start as they have been , i doubt
[987/1000]	she 's not here . that 's plain as day . except for the fact that she did n't get in the truck and not tell me . she should have told me when we were sitting on
[988/1000]	" and , of course , the rest of the universe , " xin spoke with her voice flat and unemotional . it was about a minute in between all the loud noises of the odyssey and the noise
[989/1000]	the lady did n't respond at first , but when she did , it was so clear that the two were about the same age , that charlotte was slightly younger than she was . she said very , very
[990/1000]	" i 'm glad that your sister 's okay after she 's gotten herself mixed up in all this , " my father continued . i finished up the application , then looked up at him . " they
[991/1000]	" is that so ? " then they were gone . " is n't anyone here looking for you ? " " i 'm sure they 're gone , " she said . but she was n't the only
[992/1000]	chapter fourteen : the long walk the next morning , a hot new day dawned before dawn . sun shone bright and it was all i could do to see my feet in the morning mud as i plodded
[993/1000]	" oh , i got in with mr. and mrs. thompson , " i said . " really , i did . " and it was so true . mrs. thompson made me go back to my room ,
[994/1000]	" do you often run during the day ? " " sometimes . " suddenly , she understood what that meant . but a part of her was n't surprised . he was good - looking . better
[995/1000]	" yes . " " i should have come sooner , but i wanted to tell you once we got you here ... before i came here . " he shook his head a little . " it 's
[996/1000]	" where 's the f * * k that come from ? " the second the words left his mouth i shoved him away . " if you think you can just leave my apartment and try to figure out
[997/1000]	" no , i have to go . call me back if you need anything . " we hang up , and i slide the phone back into my pocket . " he seems like a nice dude .
[998/1000]	mike continued . " that is a small matter , mike . i know of no way of dealing with them , but i have no plans of allowing them to take over any of it . " "
[999/1000]	" nothing . i 'm already here . " " okay . follow me , " his secretary said . after she left after bidding him good night , he closed his eyes and let his head fall
