[1/1000]	" what the fuck ? " he growled and dropped the pillow , knocking over a chair . the one from the bed was already in disarray , spilling over its side and onto the carpet . <EOS> ' bed
[2/1000]	" there 's this thing that you were always missing , is n't there ? maybe our special order was wrong , and it was stolen from us , " lily offered , trying a different tack . " maybe
[3/1000]	i smiled , then hesitated . this woman in front of me with her gun ... how was i supposed to hide anything from her ? i was so far gone that i had no clue what i wanted .
[4/1000]	" this thing ? it killed you ? " " yeah , i was running full speed . they caught me . " " they , " she said again , looking at the dead zombie on the
[5/1000]	" what ? " " please . " i felt the heat of the glow on my cheeks , but i felt no embarrassment on my behalf . " i 'm sorry . you do n't need to
[6/1000]	this might bring everything on the horizon right back to him , more quickly than he thought he could deal with , but somehow he needed it to be something as simple as a love sentence . he had n't
[7/1000]	" no . i have n't met her . she found some out that i had . " " how about i go look her up and find out some other things and we can figure things out ?
[8/1000]	the words were coming out of my mouth before i realized they were coming and that perhaps i had n't meant them . but i had decided to say them . i had done what i could to save everyone
[9/1000]	" it will be my pleasure , and no offense , but she is not in a position to decide . " " she may be if she is taken , " hammond said to laurence in frustration ,
[10/1000]	" you can go , " he tells me and i watch him walk away from me . looking at my hands , i notice that my fingernails are shredded from digging into them . i do n't even know
[11/1000]	" what about the flowers ? " she asks me . i look up into her eyes and grin . " yeah . got them . " " wow . " she 's still standing in front of
[12/1000]	" how about ' i 'm getting scared ' ? " i asked , a tiny smile quir king one corner of my mouth . " you get a lot of those . " i sat in my
[13/1000]	but once again , she was alone with the man from the other room , looking out into the dark garden , suddenly uncertain of what she should do . " what are you afraid of , princess ?
[14/1000]	i pulled the sheet more tight around our waists as it streamed from his lips down to nibble on one nipple . then he let his lips move across that one , too , then he stopped so his mouth
[15/1000]	" when you 're gone , i 'll fix my phone , " she says , like she 's telling me i have to get down or else she 'll lose it . her voice drops lower with each word
[16/1000]	' what about you ? ' i asked , breaking the silence , and she turned and grinned , suddenly no longer nervous . ' i 'll never have time to meet the woman you 're going to marry
[17/1000]	one of them grinned and said , " thanks . i think . " the other nodded and then wandered away , probably hoping the cops left him alone . * * * at least i was n't
[18/1000]	it was getting darker again . i did n't have to wait long for the night to come . we approached a large iron gate . the gate was a tall chain . as we looked around we noticed a
[19/1000]	i was still in a fu gue state . even though i had the right to it , i could n't bring myself to use it . after a long , drawn - out wait with no answer , i
[20/1000]	" i just need to rest now . " " that 's fine . " " i thought i 'd see you again this afternoon . " " oh ? " he seemed disappointed . "
[21/1000]	" i 'm being honest here , " i say . " if you do n't believe me , call the police . let me go , please . " he scowls down at me , holding his hand
[22/1000]	" if you do n't hear from me soon , " i said . " i need you . " " i 'll have my blackberry on you . " i hung up . * * *
[23/1000]	" not this time . i 'm tired of making things up . you already know what i wanted the moment we came outside in the parking lot . " " yes , i did . so why did
[24/1000]	i felt the hair on my neck stand on end . i swallowed hard and reached for the door handle , my hand shaking as i did . luke 's eyes were glued to me as his head twitched
[25/1000]	he did n't say anything to her . his eyes closed and his lips parted . her mouth closed on the motion , and then she swallowed . holy shit . it was the hottest thing she 'd done
[26/1000]	" you could n't get it for me , " he tried again . " so yeah , i hate you . " " i did n't ask you to hate me . i accepted the fact that we
[27/1000]	i was going to say something different but what i would n't do was to break her heart . the tears she was n't able to shed would n't go away so i kept my mouth shut and let her
[28/1000]	his jaw clenched and his mouth tightened . " a couple of years ago , i 'd never have gotten that . " " you 're right . " " and the whole thing was completely unnecessary .
[29/1000]	once more , we were surrounded by shadows . and then the shadows moved . a huge figure appeared , moving <EOS> so slowly , arms , legs , and torso . both of them were all in
[30/1000]	he turned from the mirror and gazed out the window , lost in thought . " just because it 's snowing , it does n't mean i 'm going to break something . " " it was a nice
[31/1000]	" i know . " before i give him a chance to say anything more , james hands me a folded business card . " call me the minute you get a minute . " i pull my
[32/1000]	he lifted his head slightly to focus on my voice , when i pulled the curtain aside to let him get to stand with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , his forehead against his
[33/1000]	i was still shaking when we reached the house . his house . now , the thought of just that night on his couch ... my heart was pounding , my dick aching . when a pounding came
[34/1000]	i nodded . " all right then , well . okay then . " she sighed . " i 'll be around to see you tomorrow . i 'm just a little nervous . " " of course
[35/1000]	instead , he asked , " care to explain what i did wrong ? " " you 're angry at me ? " her voice came so low it nearly reached the table . " yes , and
[36/1000]	" well then . " he stared hard into my eyes . " my name is michael . " chapter seventeen we rode in silence . there was nothing to say . a light breeze rustled the
[37/1000]	her life was n't even a living thing . it was a blank canvas before her . did he really expect her to recognize him ? how could he ? she 'd never liked him . for some reason ,
[38/1000]	his lips pressed together , and then the corner of his mouth twitched . " i know you did n't . " a shudder racked me and i remembered that i needed to do something to calm the sensation
[39/1000]	this woman had more strength than he had realized . he 'd tried to feed not once , but twice , trying not to become an enemy . yet it had been there , hanging on as if a thread
[40/1000]	" they 're not <EOS> it of the way the way she used her husband but still there was good friends - i 'm glad to see the kids . i 'd rather not have to hide my ass
[41/1000]	" i 'll stay , " he said . " you ca n't stay . i 'm going with you , " i said . " they 'll hurt you . " " are n't they already
[42/1000]	with the same lack of alarm , no one stood with him on the deck as he scanned the port area . there were as many of the royal guard as there were of the pirate lords and their captives
[43/1000]	" let me think , " she said . " i ca n't find the right sequence . " then they made a decision . " get the papers from dorothy coe 's office , " reacher called
[44/1000]	then , with a sudden movement that gave her a glimpse of the very real man that lived beneath them , dimitri slipped her hands up his chest and wrapped his arms around her slender waist and pulled her forward
[45/1000]	i think i 'm glad she turned her back before coming toward me . i ca n't stand up any more , i need to kiss her . my lips find hers . i pull her in close as
[46/1000]	" i do n't think there 's anyone as fine a person as you . " " there is n't ? " " i 'm not saying there is . " " that 's admirable . you
[47/1000]	" ' sc use me , gentlemen . the city council told me what happened " . he bowed and disappeared . jack watched him go . " the city council . what do you think i am doing
[48/1000]	" yeah , " i smile . * * * " i get it , " i say , crossing my arms over my chest . " you 're not staying at drew 's . that 's fine
[49/1000]	she 'd planned how to throw herself off the monkey bars on the other side - right into john 's arms . it was bad enough that he knew him so well , but what would he think ? would
[50/1000]	i did n't even know where to start or how to tell him that he did have my heart . i was completely at a loss . " i 'm in love with you . " " you could
[51/1000]	" thanks for allowing me to take you to dinner , " he said . " when you 're feeling better , i will accept your offer and arrange for a dinner date . " she beamed at him
[52/1000]	" i am ? " there 's no hint of a question in his voice . but somehow he knows i 'm not talking about that . i nod slowly , feeling completely overwhelmed . " i love you
[53/1000]	in a few more minutes , we were on our way with a very small package that i knew to be a gift for me from my mommy . i stared at it , feeling more complete as i held
[54/1000]	" what do you mean ? " said zachary . " these people have done nothing but care for me . they have raised me and made me feel at home , " said windsor , now spitting water
[55/1000]	' no , i do n't think they would . maybe you could check the letters . ' the answer was yes . ' thanks , ' i told her , and then i noticed that i was holding
[56/1000]	at that , the king spoke . " the queen has been taken directly from the bedchamber . she has been brought here on foot or upon the wagon by several other slaves . the queen came to tell
[57/1000]	" if i stay , i keep her safe . you 're right , " he conceded , the worry settling over him . " i know , " she said a few moments later , stroking the lines
[58/1000]	i sighed , trying to be brave after the last thing i could feel was relief . a little over a month later , the ambulance and cop cars pulled into my yard , and the ambulance and cop
[59/1000]	i had the choice , right ? chapter twenty - seven " have you thought of what you 're going to do when you graduate ? " tristan asked me , just minutes before he let the phone
[60/1000]	he pulls away and puts his hands down by his sides . " no , no , no , do n't be silly , they are just , well , if you did not want me to know that ,
[61/1000]	" the name is david , " i said . it took david a moment to realize . that was odd . " no . it 's - " his arms got a little tighter around me , and
[62/1000]	" i hope so . we need to keep our heads screwed on right , " richard replied . " we 'll keep in contact here while we learn more about the situation . if anything happens to us
[63/1000]	" well , i like it . " " good . " she grins . " but i can already tell you thought i was n't good enough . " " you 're too sweet . "
[64/1000]	" no , really , " she said . " please , please , do n't take it away . " " what , you mean this one ? " his eyes flickered left and right . " yeah
[65/1000]	" are you on my side again ? " the man said , " we all know you lied to us about the whole girl - stealing shit act , and this has to stop ! " now the
[66/1000]	* * * the next morning , as i dressed at breakfast , i put together a tray for finn to eat on , only this time he was a few years younger and very hungry . in a
[67/1000]	" i 'm still here to fight it , " said peter . " i told her we were fighting it . " " well , give her something else , then , " said the doctor . "
[68/1000]	" i ca n't . i have all i need ! " " how badly do you want it ? " he whispered hoarsely . " i need to get the information ! " he cupped her
[69/1000]	" we were trying to pick a target , " she said . " we ? " she turned to look at me . " me and myself , " she said . " the most important
[70/1000]	the two of them locked eyes and she could n't look away . chapter 7 there was something strangely intimate about that . he had to force himself not to touch lily in front of anyone else except
[71/1000]	john laughed . " i think he was getting the idea . he was even more desperate than you to get to us . " i stared at him in surprise - as i had been to john on
[72/1000]	" it was you ! " he was n't sure which of his brain was fighting for dominance . he did n't know how or why , but she deserved that . his baby sister was like a sister to
[73/1000]	please . please . more than i hoped . his hand fisted , hard . " get up . your hands will stay , the way i specified . " but i could n't . " i feel
[74/1000]	as ever ? yeah , on valentine 's day . so she knew he was n't a cop anymore . she 'd known because the guy she 'd been watching had been dead . " how 's your
[75/1000]	she tried to remember the last time she and paul had played , but it was hazy . but even so , the memory evoked a memory she could n't shake . " i remember everything about the early settlers
[76/1000]	" was that you ? " i say . " yes " she says . " my dear brother has finally found his way back to us . what are you doing out here ? " i step
[77/1000]	still , he reached out and took her hand . " i was hoping to get to know you before spending this day at a party , " he said . " oh , i 'm sure that
[78/1000]	" that does n't make sense , " i said . " i found it . " she pointed her knitting needle at me . " that 's what makes it work . " i stared at the
[79/1000]	i feel like i 've seen too much , that there 's a difference between seeing and knowing . things i have n't seen in ten years . i could n't do that yet . " i
[80/1000]	he shifted the cart in the direction of the cave . again , a low sound escaped her , and a low ripple of vibration rocked the cart . " what 's this ? " " a
[81/1000]	the guard frowned . " the way he looks at her . like she 's some kind of ... trouble . " she was . that was the whole point . his business was his - and she 'd
[82/1000]	" of course , dear . go and fetch me something dry and clean to wear to a warm day . " my family had all been having a good day . they had all played bridge for fun
[83/1000]	a voice called out from up above and i watched her go . i was starting to wonder if maybe she just slipped through , giving for us so that we could go to that god - awful diner ,
[84/1000]	" because of the children of evil and the love the woman has for her sons ? " he asked . " they 're married , " i replied . " i told them to marry someone else ,
[85/1000]	" i do n't think so , " holden said . " if there 's one thing i can find out about them , it 's that they 're really good liars . and they know that i know about
[86/1000]	she took a deep breath and sighed . " why are you doing this ? " she asked , trying to reason with him . " because , you , " he said , his hand moving up her
[87/1000]	" or ... " he turned toward her face , lowering his lips to hers . " or maybe we can stay right here till morning and you can kiss me until we ca n't breathe again . "
[88/1000]	she had tried to talk him out of it , of course , he kept thinking , but this one was just too serious . he needed to be careful with her . he could n't afford to get into
[89/1000]	the moment had n't even registered , but was taken back by her first act on looking at him . how was he doing this ? he looked different now that she was back in his sight . better looking
[90/1000]	" yes . it would please me greatly if you would be so kind as to escort me to the carriage . " rosalind paused in the hall , her stomach turning in knots . the man had accosted
[91/1000]	i went to her , my face an inch from her own , as i saw the rage in her gaze because i did n't even comprehend it . " no ! " i screamed , hating myself for making
[92/1000]	just then , there was a knock at the door . she quickly covered the mouthpiece as she said , " sorry , i was n't ready to admit him . just wanted to check on him . "
[93/1000]	it felt like being on hold for a year . i had n't remembered much about my real life other than a couple of nights when i slept like a baby . i did n't remember anything that happened
[94/1000]	" i suppose so , " i said . " we 're not exactly known for our tact yet . " " no . you are not . but given time we 'll be able to get you a
[95/1000]	just to be clear , i 'm not from the u.s. what does that mean ? i ca n't possibly know . but i 'm a fan of the american love story . i 'm also a fan of
[96/1000]	she could n't . she should have never said something to him , should have driven off with nick in spite of everything . but she could n't do it anymore . " i ca n't believe that .
[97/1000]	" stop being so nice to me and open up , " he groaned through gritted teeth . she took that as encouragement and he pressed up harder , shoving more pressure into her until she could n't take
[98/1000]	" can we agree that you are not going to tell me what 's going on ? " he asked . " not likely . " she put her hand on top of his against the steering wheel .
[99/1000]	' yes , you like it , do n't you ? ' she asked , pleased in spite of herself . ' oh , yes , it 's spectacular , ' a voice said . itzy turned her
[100/1000]	" a very good idea . " we drove to the coast . the moon sat on the horizon like a shining mirror . i hoped that the water would have some color . i liked the way my
[101/1000]	" are you well ? " he asked , rubbing his thumb over her hairline . he smiled when she sighed and leaned into him more fully . god , she felt good . " you did n't look well
[102/1000]	" i 'm not afraid , " i said defiantly , turning to look at my grandmother . she lowered her eyes , like i 'd pushed off a wall . " if you are not afraid , then
[103/1000]	" i want the police to get some help on this . there 's always a way . if we can bring more people to this town for safety concerns , then our only choice is to live in our
[104/1000]	" you 're right . " " i know . " she smoothed a hand over the top of her curls , in obvious approval of the gesture . " you really should n't take advantage of one another
[105/1000]	do you have any objections to the concept of love in our world , your grace ? " " of course in my state , a great deal of those people are already married , your grace . i
[106/1000]	" how are things going with the kids ? " he asked . for a moment , she wondered what the answer would be . what to do . " all right . i guess . they 're fine
[107/1000]	the girl turned . was it just wishful thinking or did she have that effect on everyone ? it was so surreal . " what are you doing here , anyway ? i thought you hated heights - "
[108/1000]	" but it 's the fastest way out , the least likely , " i agreed . " what if there was a wolf there ? " " then i 'll try to shift . " i shook
[109/1000]	" ah , good . i thought you might know . the same old , same old . you 're just lucky . it 's not every living thing who finds their way to hades . it 's usually the
[110/1000]	" i do n't understand . i should warn you that i could n't do it anymore . all of them have been locked in protective cages the last few months and i thought , really , a bit of
[111/1000]	i glanced up and saw a pair of blond - headed men who had been sitting at their table . " hey , guys , " i said , nodding our way . " this is my roommate , rory
[112/1000]	i know the same thing ! this has all been a very stressful first year . this , my dear , is yet another test , and i can not lose this year . no , not a chance
[113/1000]	and he 'd actually wanted to see what it felt like to be tied to her . he 'd wanted to hear that scream . no , he wanted more than that . her eyes were closed ,
[114/1000]	even with his powerful powers , he could n't get past our armor . we would have stopped him . " not that i thought he would have survived the next few hours , but he had to say
[115/1000]	" not here . take me to my room , " he hissed , his voice thick and gravelly . " not out back , " i said as i made my way down the hall . "
[116/1000]	he gave his head a crooked shake , a gesture that was n't entirely a smile , and started to turn away . " i suppose he has his own questions . " " so you did n't come
[117/1000]	" yes , " the one with gold hair said . the only time i saw the two of them was the night they were put together , when i was there . i ca n't say i 'm
[118/1000]	" i know that you two have n't seen each other in , what , eleven years or so ? " " yeah , but it happens . " " do n't forget the honeymoon , " the
[119/1000]	" no , " she replied . " good , " i stated then the rest of it hit me , i was totally thinking they would prefer they liked it that way . at least i had n't
[120/1000]	the words cut into her . she leaned back against the doorframe as her head pounded with every heavy heartbeat . she and nick had made promises to get what they wanted . yet they had n't only offered
[121/1000]	" where are you going ? " her father asked in alarm . " i 'm going to meet max . " her stepfather eyed her expectantly . " you ca n't go by yourself . you 're
[122/1000]	" a ... oh , " she mumbled . " yeah , just promise me . no more talking . " lexi shrugged , trying to look unconcerned . " okay . " " i will tell
[123/1000]	a hard , calloused hand came down on the back of his neck lifting him over towards the bed . " now , i think i want my wife to be as pregnant as you are . i 'm going
[124/1000]	' ' you have my permission to leave if you wish . just say the word , tom . ' ' it is no use to you , ' growled the shaman in a hissing growl . ' your
[125/1000]	the boys were amazed that one of those boys had a heart that was n't as shattered as hers . they played games with the boys after school for the rest of the day , just as nick had done
[126/1000]	" fuck . " i grabbed for her , but my hand was halted by the heavy glass door of the bar . a man in a suit walked through first , with a bright smile on his face .
[127/1000]	" come to gloat , are we ? " he 's right - not a morning person , not a guy this hot . he 's too good to be true . " right . " " you
[128/1000]	there was , apparently , another sort of strange sensation - this one not only warm and safe under my skin , but a pleasant warmth that seemed to crawl under my skin , as well . i looked
[129/1000]	" i did n't know if we would be able to finish this , i was n't sure how you would respond . i hope you 're feeling better now , " said planner with resignation . " yes
[130/1000]	but none of those old traditions survived of our parents . " and so you are aware of the real situation , then ? " now mrs. pur d h y looked over at her son , her eyes watery
[131/1000]	the light of the campfire shot up in the near darkness , illuminating logan 's face in the flame . his eyes widened in horror , and he looked around , just as the sound of an oncoming train broke
[132/1000]	" no , " i said . " this is the last time i will ever say that . you will never see me do anything that i would do for anyone else . you will never know the difference
[133/1000]	" that 's bad . i 'm sorry . " " it 's not your fault . " " neither was jumping up and down . " " oh , god . " " it 's
[134/1000]	" yes . come in , please . " then he added , " oh , and i have something very good in this box . " mary ann paused for effect , her eyes glazed , the expression
[135/1000]	with a start , he remembered she was n't a vampire . she was a normal woman . he should have known . it was their blood she was going to drink tonight . he would have killed for her
[136/1000]	" is that a problem ? " " sure thing , " she says and lets go , trying to ignore the slight loss of contact . he gets up and goes out , closing the door behind
[137/1000]	" i missed a lot of the class , " she said . " i read more , but then i went and studied at the library and i did n't have it in me to listen to music <EOS>
[138/1000]	before she could reply , ethan was on his feet , a gun in his hand . a deadly looking double barreled shotgun with a spring handle and a handle that slid easily from one hand to the other .
[139/1000]	he raised his eyes and met hers . " you 'll stay here tonight ? " he asked , <EOS> ... instead . " yes . " his smile . his eyes sparkled his way through the water
[140/1000]	" it 's been a long time , " she said , looking away from him and out the window toward the water . she 'd never been quite sure why he 'd sent her there with him , seeing
[141/1000]	if there was any life in his expression , it was n't mirth . " no , but - " that , along with the fury , melted the ice from the air that had cracked before , leaving
[142/1000]	he opened his mouth , but she continued . " and this . " she ran her finger through her wet , curly hair . " but the thing is , the thing is i feel safe with you
[143/1000]	" i 'm no hero , " muttered gregor . " i 'm more of a baby - sitter for a big - time mom . " " of course . do n't you think it 's wonderful ?
[144/1000]	" my parents are going to be mortified . look at me ! " she giggled . " i 'm a mess . " " so ... how did you meet ? " " wow . i ca
[145/1000]	the night was filled with a mist . it clung to me in a cold embrace so great as to creep into my nostrils and into my breast . what began as a strange nightmare was now , in
[146/1000]	" there 'll be more , " he said . as if sensing what was coming at her . " remember that . you 're everything . " she did n't <EOS> ... he had to clear his throat
[147/1000]	before she could say any more , he 'd slipped his hand between her legs . she sucked in a breath and , when he palmed her mound for the first time since that time he had touched her in
[148/1000]	" you know : i think the most remarkable thing of all is that , yes , even as a child , i ca n't remember ever hearing of a man so brave . " i looked up at
[149/1000]	" why was it so important ? " " because he had done it before , i said . as far as i was concerned , he was still part of our home . he wanted to be there
[150/1000]	" do n't worry about me , " she said . " i have plenty of problems , and i have plenty of clients i need to take care of right now . " " so , what about

[153/1000]	but that was okay , because it was about time someone killed his mother . he 'd seen her die twice now . twice . was he wrong about that ? he felt his eyes sting and the
[154/1000]	" no chance , " she answered . " not now . maybe later . " i looked back at the door , trying to find some way to open it . my fingernails were scraping at my palms
[155/1000]	* * * his hand moved in the dark after midnight . he 'd brought a few pillows and he used them to prop himself up on his forearms . he did n't want to move . he was
[156/1000]	as i reached a safe distance from the house , i saw a glimpse of his black suit - the one he 'd left with the dead - and saw the gun that he 'd casually tucked under his arm
[157/1000]	i felt both guilty that i 'd made the first move . and guilty that i was going to keep doing the same thing , from my first steps in a new kind of being to my second steps in
[158/1000]	' if a couple of the women were interested in you , why were n't you already asking her ! ' i said and started laughing . ' i would n't have to ask you , then , would i

[161/1000]	" well , not to mention <EOS> it . " " what are you looking for ? " " i suppose . what type of beer is it then ? " they both knew the answer ,
[162/1000]	" i do n't really know . but she 's an old hag , the same as me . i 've seen her before when she and i were getting ready for the gala . she used to come in
[163/1000]	my fingers twitched and started stroking up and down it . he lifted his head , met my eyes and i realized , without thinking how i knew , that somehow i 'd been lying under him for hours ,
[164/1000]	" but , " i say . " you 're in it . that does n't mean i ca n't help someone else . " " let me ask you something . why did you have to be so
[165/1000]	" what ? you 're not afraid people will go back ? " " no , of course not . " " oh , " i said . that explained so much . that he was so willing
[166/1000]	he did n't want to eat , so he just glanced up at her while she sipped her whiskey . " well look at you . " she was breathing hard and smiling with her eyes wide . she
[167/1000]	" like what ? " but i did n't want to know the answer . " like like , she 's in love , " dad answered . " in love ? " " with someone ,
[168/1000]	" it 'll probably be in the mail by the time we get back , " i reminded her , and she waved me off , grinning . " no worries , " she said , and then i
[169/1000]	" the man - beast ! " i say , and for a moment , i feel terrible for such an affront . " it 's the only real way to get through to them . " and although
[170/1000]	" what else will happen ? " " i ca n't say for sure yet . it will be difficult to predict . " " i understand that you 're not keen on her , but you should
[171/1000]	" okay . i 'm going to turn into him . i 'm going to start to change , and when he tries to hit me , i 'm going to try to kick him in the balls with my
[172/1000]	he nodded and stood up . " okay , so now what ? " " i 'll go and write up some information so we can sort things out . " i waited for his reaction but he
[173/1000]	there was n't anything good or bad in the air , i was sure of it . the moon was full and the sound of the waves was deafening to my ears in this part of the ocean . if

[178/1000]	" i 'm here to help , is everything okay ? " he asked her , worry creasing his face at the odd behavior of her . " not at all . i just came to help . "
[179/1000]	he wanted to reassure her , but all he could think about was seeing his wife and son together again . their child growing underneath them , a life they had n't even known each other for . he
[180/1000]	and he needed her more than he needed breath . now that someone was gone , the urge to touch her was almost too much to bear , and him pushing inside her , plunging into her body ,
[181/1000]	" i 'm not going to try to be a perfect boyfriend . " " it 's not you , is it ? " she asks , " it 's me . you 've been nothing but supportive when
[182/1000]	her teeth locked around the steel bar . her hand tightened on it , pulling it from her fingers . the light reflected off her body as the guard bent over her and looked at her with fear in his

[191/1000]	after what seemed like an eternity to her , the guy sighed and raised his head . " no , just because your blood acts good for me does n't mean you 're going to get rich out of it

[200/1000]	there had been many warnings that he may have become addicted to alcohol that night . one example had proven to him that he had actually met and fallen in love with a woman . he had never been attracted
[201/1000]	" tell me what happened , " he told her gently . he wanted ... needed ... to know . " you wo n't like me , " she admitted in a broken voice . " i already told
[202/1000]	i do n't want to talk about it . i ca n't talk about what i saw . i can barely breathe as i slowly walk downstairs . when i get to the living room , alex is sitting

[208/1000]	they were both looking at her again . ' have to go and see ' was all lizzie knew . she did n't know what to do . lizzie gave a small shake of her head . no , but
[209/1000]	" not me , sweetheart . " " i thought everyone talked so much about it , " she confessed as we climbed the steps . " i know which one i do n't like more . "
[210/1000]	" how can i serve the lord above when will i just be a nun until the day my life ends ? " " you serve the lord , in the sense of serving him . " "
[211/1000]	he picked up his left foot and brushed some dirt from his trousers . still on the porch , he swung his leg over the front step , then climbed down to the porch . after giving it a few
[212/1000]	" all right . " " you need to leave me alone , " she shot back . " i 'll be back as soon as the roads clear . " " this is too much .
[213/1000]	which told her a lot . she gave him her full attention . " you 're right . i need to get dressed . i 'll bet you have to pack a bag to leave . " he
[214/1000]	i was n't thinking clearly . i never thought i would be there , alone , but i 'd seen and done that with my mother . " you do n't feel so strong , allie , right ?
[215/1000]	that was her idea , he supposed , except she did n't know it . it had n't occurred to him that she may be worried about the fact that he might be moving on . he 'd barely had
[216/1000]	she did n't mean to but she did . her thoughts drifted . the last thing she remembered with the dream came rushing back . " i could not escape . i had no idea that vampires were so damned

[218/1000]	" i 'm not sure , but did n't she give you anything to drink ? " " yes ... a glass of milk . " " milk ? milk always helps . but the food will do
[219/1000]	and then , just to aggrav ate him even more , she swung off his lap . " i 'm going to go sit in the back with the babies . you should get some rest . " "
[220/1000]	" i do n't know . i only knew about it because i overheard one of the professors talking to professor ka plan , and , well , i saw some stuff . he said that you 'd been fighting
[221/1000]	" the king , " i said . an image jumped into my head of his eyes . he was very hard , very serious and cold . it was the look of a calculating man who had a plan
[222/1000]	" yes , and where is my son ? are you all right ? " the woman smiled . " yes , i 'm fine . can i ask you something , mr. alexander ? " " yes

[226/1000]	" no , it does n't even . it 's just a rock that 's a little thinner than a human 's wrist . it may just be as sturdy as a boulder . " " whatever you say
[227/1000]	then she said it . ' the real one . ' the one she wanted . ' i could n't believe it when i got it . i heard you talking to the manager at the post office , and

[237/1000]	i 'm walking through the lobby , taking note of every step and looking around the lobby , when i hear someone calling my name . turning , my breathing quick ens as the door opens and a lovely
[238/1000]	" i 'm glad to hear that . " he pushed against me gently to take the spot he wanted to leave . " so , talk . " i took a deep breath and went on to tell
[239/1000]	his chest was heaving as his eyes roved over my face . " jesus christ , harper . " his muscles flexed as he sucked in a ragged breath and reached for me , taking me roughly by the shoulders
[240/1000]	" how you been ? " " busy with my clients , that 's what . " " your clients ? " he gave the most un convincing smile in the history of grins . " i
[241/1000]	but , wait ? why here ? he 'd never said about the job . he 'd already made up his mind years ago that he was n't going into some business trip , he did n't need their money
[242/1000]	" no . " " yes . " " so what are you going to do , i wonder ? " " the same thing i always do , be happy . " " what about
[243/1000]	i ca n't take my eyes off her . i ca n't believe this . i ca n't believe i found them . they 're not here . they 're not . they 've been found . " get
[244/1000]	he looked over at her with a smirk in his eyes . his fingers dug into her knee , pulling her closer to him , his lips still tingling ever so gently . what had she just done ?
[245/1000]	he looked up at me and i smiled as i dropped to my knees . he reached in his blazer pocket , pulled out a card , and stuck it into my hand . " your number is on
[246/1000]	she lifted her face to look at him . " you 're not the only one , mr. miller . but you 'll have to get used to it . " one dark eyebrow was raised . his hands
[247/1000]	he 'd spent the last twenty minutes telling her how much he loved her and how he needed her - never once missing a beat in his promise of future love . and now the truth was hitting him
[248/1000]	a week later , my first attempt at re making my hair was a disaster . i had to scrape it away from my face and run a comb through it , which left me wearing a ridiculous array of
[249/1000]	" you must tell me what is going on , my dear - please . what have you done ? " " i have no idea . " " it is too bad that mr. grandcourt will not
[250/1000]	" stop , mother dear ! " we hear a loud voice called out . " no more , you ! do you hear me ? you 're not going to take my boys - , " and it gets
[251/1000]	" he 's not mine . " " but he did , " she insisted , coming down to a sitting position and tugging on him with surprising effort . " if you 're in a hurry ,
[252/1000]	" i 'm sorry , mr. gray . i only remembered . but you do get things from your mother - in - law . no one thought it over too deeply and gave you up on your own .
[253/1000]	" well , yes , i suppose it may . what do you say to that ? " " well , the whole incident just sort of escaped me . " i say with barely concealed guilt .
[254/1000]	he smiled at her and he just could n't resist looking good , she thought . no underwear , just his sweatshirt , his black boxer briefs , his long , dark hair hanging in his eyes as he took
[255/1000]	' but she 's gone , ' i say , thinking , he wo n't come back now he knows we kissed and a kiss is more important than you two and a kiss is always more important than a
[256/1000]	" sure , " he said . " and you call me the whore from the past . " he waited and then started laughing . " i guess the worst part is that it makes me so mad
[257/1000]	" what now ? " she asked , exasperated . was she getting ahead of herself ? did she want to have sex with him ? and what did that mean ? could every woman on this planet be lusting
[258/1000]	" what is this thing ? " he pointed to the large white glass window . " hold on a second , " the doctor said . " you need to check that out . " he
[259/1000]	i turn my head and look at him . " you know what . why do n't you stay here and i 'll go check on olivia . " he smiles his smile so i know i was only
[260/1000]	" i never expected to learn anything to this point . i never thought the brotherhood was just going to stand there and wait for orders . but i guess i thought too much to be surprised by anything in
[261/1000]	" no , " i admitted . " oh , " she said , looking confused for a second . " i 'll write if you 're busy . " " i 'll be busy , " i
[262/1000]	the man looked at me as he walked by , then returned his attention to the road . i took in a deep breath and gathered myself . " sir , where is your car ? " the
[263/1000]	" so then ... " i trailed off , not knowing what else to say . a wave of regret washed over me as i realized that i was n't strong enough to get up from that bed . it
[264/1000]	chapter 5 : the past when the police finished with cassie i was walking past the park when i saw chris standing across from me . he stood with both arms stretched out , and his head rested back
[265/1000]	" this is stupid . he 's not real . he 's ... " her eyes darted around the club . " he 's a ... a vampire , not a vampire . " " i know . "
[266/1000]	" but ... " " my dad , in particular . " " of course . but ... you ca n't let him ... " " that 's not how things are done , lil . not
[267/1000]	he was breathing hard , hands still shaking . " it was a matter of getting some people looking for you . you were going to tell me about - jesus christ . " his voice caught . i winced
[268/1000]	" i 'm being murdered ! " i screamed into the phone . " i do n't want to kill anyone or anything ! i just want to get this guy off of me so i can get <EOS> just
[269/1000]	" this girl is n't taking any chances ! " " why not ? she is n't expecting anything . she has no plans to take any risks . where am i to watch her ? " i would
[270/1000]	" and if she wanted me to , she 'd have come . i want you . she did n't have to see me . " " i want you . " i think i 'd just heard
[271/1000]	the third creature , a long , dark creature , its neck nearly touching the ground , was perched in the tree beside his . it was a different one , larger , but it was not the giant creature
[272/1000]	" no , i do n't have any money . " " so what ? who was the third one , charlie ? are you going to make some more ? " " no , " he said
[273/1000]	" sure thing . " i smiled . he chuckled . " see , you made me relax , you make me look good . " when he said " i " i thought he was kidding , but
[274/1000]	he smiled at her , his grin just as warm as his voice . " and you too . " chapter two the car came to a stop in front of <EOS> ... one - then she was
[275/1000]	" he 's a f * * king loser , " i murmur . " you should see a few of the other guys . one even offered to give us a ride to a meeting on friday , and
[276/1000]	" who killed her , then ? " " i do n't know . it 's rather strange . it seems her family left town and she 's been missing for a while . i 'd never heard of
[277/1000]	she stepped onto the pier and leaned against one side , while cole walked slowly to the other side of the pier and climbed under a deck ladder . " yes , " he said . " i have

[280/1000]	he nodded to the door and waited as they opened it . the three of us stood in silence as the guard stood right behind us . " just do n't knock unless you want to be trampled .

[282/1000]	i saw his eyes flash in rage , then shift to surprise , just like mine had . and then he was kissing me , his mouth devouring mine . the kiss was firm , hungry , and desperate .
[283/1000]	" are you sure you want to do this ? " ian asked , coming to stand beside her . she gazed out into the night , unable to meet his eyes . ian had come after her with
[284/1000]	" i might have gotten him back for you . " " this is so good , " i said , still holding on . so was he . every time i let go , it felt like it
[285/1000]	i was struck by the way his eyes sparkled . " i suppose i am glad i met you . the circumstances are different , i think . our father died a few weeks back . i 've never seen
[286/1000]	the other children laughed upro ariously . " i 'm joking . " i gave a weak smile to each teacher . " the kids are a little too well behaved . " " i do n't think
[287/1000]	his eyes closed . " it 's our job to help them , and we have to continue to do it that way . if there is any help at all , it will come from me . "
[288/1000]	" is that who is ? " she asks . i nod . " and another thing , you can only be seen by the watchers in the next room . " she gives me a confused look
[289/1000]	" oh , come on . his kid was my girlfriend ; then you decide you want me to just hang out in the shower with him ? i 'm not going to do that , and i 'm not
[290/1000]	" and you 've sent for me ? " " yes . " " what happened ? " " the doctor did n't say . " " did he say more than that ? "
[291/1000]	" and this one ? his name is derek . " she pulled her thumb away from the handle and removed it , admiring how much it resembled the silver blade she 'd wielded in my father 's bedroom .
[292/1000]	" i do n't want to talk about this anymore . " he moved to stand behind me , his biceps hard as he clenched them . his biceps . was he a sculptor ? had that been his
[293/1000]	he took her into the darkened bedroom and gave voice to every part of the dream she 'd spent the night having . she knew she would n't have been able to have dreamed it if he had n't been
[294/1000]	" but they will eat it ! " i had to defend myself before he made a run for it . " right now , this is your best bet , " sebastian agreed . we sat silently
[295/1000]	" let 's go , " he said , and for once i heard him sound angry and distant . with sam 's help , we climbed into the car and headed back to his place . i wondered
[296/1000]	" i am <EOS> i did n't , ' i 'm in a little ways , " i 'm going to drink for a walk through the yard , but that was rare , but most of all ,
[297/1000]	" yeah , but that does n't mean that i 'm not going to think about it . " " there 's nothing wrong with the way you think . " " i was worried when you left
[298/1000]	" i 'm sure you do . it 's like the movie but is n't , maybe is , in a bit . " " and does n't every man get a chance to see it , " charlie
[299/1000]	the line went silent . for another few minutes , they worked : smith listening intently , his gun alternately glowing with green light and emitting intermittent hums that were impossible to hear from the interior of the vehicle .
[300/1000]	" what 's that ? " " nothing , i 'll talk to you later . " he smiled . " sure . " we kissed for a long time . my lips felt swollen and sore
[301/1000]	" what are you talking about . i never ... a girl would have to be crazy to want to stay with me . my life was just starting to make sense of how things worked , and then ...
[302/1000]	" i 'm just looking for a friend , " charlie said , almost as if this was the most ridiculous explanation she could have . " i doubt you 'll find him , " she replied evenly enough
[303/1000]	" but she ran a little , saw <EOS> " and went to the back room " to shower " . " i did n't take the time to look . " " just go with the fact that
[304/1000]	" all right , i 'm serious , you 're going to feel so much better if you listen to what i have to say . there 's nothing you can do about it , so just save yourself some
[305/1000]	" i 'll ask the questions , " i said evenly . " are you going to talk to mrs. watson , or am i going to lead us on a bit of a merry chase ? " "
[306/1000]	" a fine , fine line , " said the director of cons op , chuckling despite his effort to conceal his aggravation . " now , i suppose you 'd like to read more ... what was it ,
[307/1000]	then , as if in response to his need , she thrust her tongue beneath the pad of her tongue . he was a god of pleasure when he drank , his mouth a fierce sucking action of heat and
[308/1000]	" you 're going to help me , i know you are , " she said just as fiercely . " oh , i plan to , but you 're going to need more of my help than that
[309/1000]	" i am . " it was the only way i could tell him , and now that i could see it , i knew that i was lying . " you are not lying to me . you
[310/1000]	" is that a fact ? " she stared at him in disbelief , but he simply kept his focus on her . god , she needed to cool down . she did n't have this many feelings , many
[311/1000]	" you do n't like to go where she goes ? " " i just hate it when i 'm left to do her dirty work . " " well , i 'm glad she was able to
[312/1000]	" they know we 'd never fight . no use . the time has come . " " it has ? " i looked up at him , confused . " but ... what did they say ? "
[313/1000]	" nothing ? you went up to her rooms ? ! " " she called to me from the courtyard . " " and when you did n't answer at least fifteen times ? " " she
[314/1000]	" yeah , " he said , nodding . " well , thanks . " he turned and left the room . what the hell was that ? i 'd let him leave on purpose . i thought
[315/1000]	at first , the king 's face remained blank , like an inanimate object . at first , he looked like the man who 'd stood with him for the last day and the night of the conflict . but
[316/1000]	" you see , he had a lot of money now , and a lot of plans . he got the part of it that set him up with the kids that night . i figured everyone there would like
[317/1000]	" that would be the easiest , " i confirm with a smile . " all right . " " no , you 'd be able to be a man more mature . " " for someone
[318/1000]	once inside , my head began to clear , the tension in my muscles beginning to relax . " you sound ... different than you normally do . " " maybe it 's because i 'm with you .
[319/1000]	" let 's just say , we were about to settle down together and i had that urge to jump out the window and go home , but he seemed fine . when the time came , i said yes
[320/1000]	" i 'm going with you . " he gives a defeated sigh . " fine , but it better be quick . " i head to the driver 's side door and hand him the keys and
[321/1000]	" well ! " " yeah , i 'm pretty tired . i ca n't wait till i 'm back at the compound for this . i promise i wo n't be long . " it was n't
[322/1000]	" ah , but they have him trapped ? " her face broke into understanding that i 'd escaped the dungeons . she shook her head , those wide , blue eyes narrowing . " that is very naughty and
[323/1000]	" it looks like it 's covered in blood and feathers , " said jane . " oh , shit , " gasped jack , wiping blood from his mouth on his sleeve . " it 's not that
[324/1000]	" you did n't know ? " i ask . he shakes his head as he backs away from me and slips through a couple of doors , then comes back . " we 'll talk as soon as
[325/1000]	i had a quick glance at his hand , still on the blade , showing its fingers curled around . the hilt was scarred from his days in the wilderness , but the long , bloody wounds were n't nearly
[326/1000]	" take this with you when you leave . " the witch spoke softly . her hand dropped from his . " your family is waiting for you outside . " " tell them they can come too ,
[327/1000]	but it was too late . she would find herself in the bed of a dead man before she could give him a new one . " we have to get out of here , " he said ,
[328/1000]	she said : " that 's not true . i would never hurt you . and i would never leave you . if i was in <EOS> feeling your home - " <EOS> ... " it would be the
[329/1000]	he felt both her hands on his shoulders , her body pressing against his in the intimate position with which they were sharing . her smile was all the encouragement he needed . after pressing his lips against the corner
[330/1000]	" there is nothing wrong with being a vampire with a conscience ? " he drawled , his brow arched . he was n't surprised at her lack of response . she should be used to his in sensitivity .
[331/1000]	she came at him with her arms outstretched , but the force of the kiss took him by surprise . she was like a cat , so fast she made no sound . another blow knocked him to the floor
[332/1000]	" then you 'd better make this quick . " his voice was rough and raspy . he 'd stopped at the door , and now he looked back at her . " where are you going ? "
[333/1000]	" you know what would do that to us ? " i shook my head . my eyes met his . i knew . i may be able to push him away once i 'd seen him with bethany
[334/1000]	" that 's the whole problem . we 've known each other a long time . she 's a good kid with a good heart . she never would have been caught dead with an older guy . "
[335/1000]	and he knew he could n't stop her . he kept coming at him , shoving , hitting , trying to get through , struggling to stay alive . there was a sound , he shut his eyes ,
[336/1000]	if only she meant to make him happy . he was trying hard not to - " i wo n't be working another day . oh , and do n't forget to pay the mortgage , from last night
[337/1000]	" what 's that mean ? " ben asked . " these are things that the human race only hear about . it 's where the human race is heading , where it will end , in the middle
[338/1000]	" yes . " she smiled , like a mother , and they both sat down on the bed . she flipped through the channels until she finally fell asleep , with her head on his chest . ethan
[339/1000]	but my whole world had just flipped completely upside down . she 'd been to florida to see me and even managed a few trips to the beach , including that one for the aquarium . how could there be
[340/1000]	" i 'm on my bike . go . one more word from you and i 'll call the police . " i was n't sure why she would call . surely the fbi did n't have jurisdiction already
[341/1000]	" i can not , " the white - haired woman said , tears in her eyes . " yes , " the other girl said . " you can , dear . " the white - haired
[342/1000]	" please , do n't , " he whispers . " i 'm just surprised , " she says , " that he 's willing to take you up on all of that . " " why ?
[343/1000]	" and what happened to the soul , <EOS> right out ? oh and the other and finally decided to break in the water for the sake of the rain cloud ? " there 's no music in the
[344/1000]	with the world 's most significant and wonderful child , and a loving wife , the only truly happy son in years was married to his high school sweetheart , grace . just the opposite - the daughter of a
[345/1000]	the two men talked about the impending expedition but did n't say much . as the sun slipped behind the tree tops , the boys were starting to get restless . there was always one person to do the
[346/1000]	" you could set it to go off at any hour , " she snapped . " i 'd have to give you the opportunity . anyway , you need to go home and get some sleep . i
[347/1000]	" very funny , " she mumbled . a moment later , she heard brant yelling at someone . " yeah , i know , but it 's not really funny . i just thought it would have been funny
[348/1000]	oh , lord . he was right . he could n't do this , have sex with another man . no way . he should go for the throat . " okay . i 'll do that . "
[349/1000]	he leaned forward and gave her a playful kiss . " guess what ? i really like the way you taste . i 'm going to fuck you with your name on it , tonight anyway . " her
[350/1000]	" when i was eight . i know nothing about electricity , but when i was eleven , i heard it . i was really frightened . i was eight years old and i heard it as a whisper .
[351/1000]	" it 's not a matter of money , is it ? it 's about power . " then to her own chagrin , " i wish we could tell her about the house ! i ca n't believe how
[352/1000]	" you 're right , " she says , rubbing her little nose and taking off toward the back yard . " i 'm going to talk to sam , see if they want to meet soon . "
[353/1000]	" it 's a shame you were n't allowed to see her last night , " the blond said . " we would have liked to make love again . " he reached for her , gripping her wrist
[354/1000]	i knew what he would . he did n't trust what i told him , so whether i made her pay or not , i would n't be one of his whores . i closed my eyes and wished
[355/1000]	the girl 's hair was dyed red , and her lips sported a pink streak so purple that it looked like a bruise . " oh my god ! " she exclaimed . " you 're a vampire ! "
[356/1000]	it was with a little burst of unexpected feeling that he realised what he had just seen . the woman was staring at him , her eyes full of sorrow . but she was staring like a mother would
[357/1000]	she 'd seen that look the first time they met in the bar . it had been the first time she 'd seen the concern in his gray eyes that had been her undoing . " i 'm not
[358/1000]	i rolled my eyes at all of them , but they were still giggling . " it 's enough that he 's my fiance , is n't it ? " i demanded , glancing at the group at the podium
[359/1000]	" what about her ? " i ca n't look away from luke , who 's staring at me with a hopeful look on his face . i want to cry , i want to tell him how sorry i
[360/1000]	" i ca n't believe i 'm saying this . " he smiled , clearly pleased . it faded now , and his voice turned serious . " i 'm sorry that i always thought you were a failure
[361/1000]	and that scared the ever - loving - hell out of me . " how did you know it was me ? " i ask softly . " after last night , i was following you , "
[362/1000]	he did not speak either . " it 's crazy , actually , " he said at last and she knew he 'd gotten it . " i do n't know how to understand it , but she 's
[363/1000]	" just show it to me now , will you ? " the book , at last , produced the correct amount of light . it was a pretty short and boring story . i made sure to keep
[364/1000]	" the rest , the rest , " he continued , " what do you think ? i 'll need something to put up with them getting too close to me , and you wo n't have in mind anything
[365/1000]	" oh come on , dad , " brian whined . " she 's just like any other mom with an ounce of compassion . " " stop being so melodramatic , " brian said to his youngest son
[366/1000]	" would you two mind getting out of here please ? " she asked , then gave the four of them a moment to compose themselves . " he is n't ready yet . " i had no idea
[367/1000]	<EOS> was not lost . the voice that came out of the phone that had not come from him was the voice that had never left him . he had said that he had been there after work , when
[368/1000]	" i was always a little odd . you guys should have known how i felt . " " i just do n't get why you did n't just call you brother 's and father 's and say you
[369/1000]	even though it was sunday , the light was dim outside , and the rain had n't let up . that caused the rain to splatter down outside . " what was that ? " emma asked , running
[370/1000]	he glanced at the clock a few times with the time the hospital had set it . it was only ten - thirty . he 'd been there a little over six hours . on wheels . " how
[371/1000]	" that 's not my problem . i ca n't do any more favors for him than i have already done . " " then how can you pay him all that attention ? " " because i
[372/1000]	" you ca n't go , " claire said as she looked around . " you have to go home and do anything that can be done . " she wanted desperately to be in lucian 's arms ,
[373/1000]	" she 's working on it . " " what ? why ? " " i know . it 's an emergency . " he said . " she 's coming right back to the station at twelve
[374/1000]	he took the chair facing the table and carefully put his drink down . his arms folded and the tension were visible in his face . " you did n't realize ... ? " " yeah , yeah .
[375/1000]	" if only you could have been as stupid as they had been . they had to put their own child into that life when no one else could , but some of the wolves wanted it . some of
[376/1000]	he was shaking . " was you really planning on leaving me here at all ? " " no , i suppose you misunderstood . i was merely being realistic . " " no way ! "
[377/1000]	and with that , he went to his favorite corner and read a book . once he had completed the entire book , and there was no other reading available for five or six minutes , the next page of
[378/1000]	" in fact , your boyfriend did . " " what ? i thought cole and i were at that party . " " nah , you ran off from cole , and it was totally an accident
[379/1000]	he grinned in response . " i suppose you 're right . " " it 's a good thing adam 's gone , so it 'd work out in the end , " she said , pointing at his
[380/1000]	" mr. james , you look very good today , " remarked mr. har land . " thank you , mr. har land . where 's this new new suit i saw you designing for your latest candidate -
[381/1000]	she looked , at first , shocked . did n't the guards simply watch curiously ? surely how many of them did the queen know ? but she saw the truth in their expressions . " she asked to speak
[382/1000]	" thank you , love , " he murmurs in my ear . " if i go down on you right now , it 's because i want to - because i 'd hate myself for hurting you . "
[383/1000]	" do n't you wish . " he set <EOS> and the drinks on a side table . " what 's up ? " " i can see you 've been around some . " " do you
[384/1000]	from the sound of it , he was going to make a phone call that he thought could wait . something happened over the phone line that i knew would n't really surprise her . " yes .
[385/1000]	' this is not possible ' i said . ' what are you talking about . we have seen ' i am sure you have , but we will see ' he replied . ' it 's time
[386/1000]	" they , " i 'm told . " the rest of us will need to get together and talk . you see , you have a pretty good idea of what this was all about , but can we
[387/1000]	" but we 're going somewhere else , " he says , as i run out of air . i look back to see him start running , too , towards the edge of the yard , to the woods
[388/1000]	" tell me something , " said jason . " okay , " i said . " you live with my sister , right ? she 's a doctor ? " " yes . " " how
[389/1000]	" i wish y' all would get along , " said allison , looking for the girl who could handle her . allison smiled and went on to explain to allison that this was how life was meant to
[390/1000]	" that 's it , " she said and started typing . " we 're calling him now . " " it 's not necessary to . he 'd probably say it 's a mistake and refuse to pick
[391/1000]	she looked at him , confused . " why does any man , or woman for that matter , still resist me , when i just give him what he wants ? how could he simply stand by and let
[392/1000]	" mr. bra un , it has all been too much . some things were too much . " mrs. perez cut mr. tru deau off hard . " listen up . if no other reason , why not just
[393/1000]	she stared after the car then it sped off and disappeared completely into the distance . " well , that 's that ? " caleb questioned in amazement . " that was pretty quick , but you better let
[394/1000]	i shook my head and pointed my finger at tristan . " go join them , because i 've got a very important conversation for you . " smiling , i turned back to tristan . " i hope you
[395/1000]	" no ! " the dragon stepped farther into the clearing . " all in the name , child . " he held out a clawed claw . annwyl took the old claw . pulling her head
[396/1000]	" i 'll go see what they 're paying you for , " the voice said . i could hear my mother 's voice in my ear through the radio . " there 's no way that i 'm
[397/1000]	my grandmother reached her hand up , but the demon had already spun away , his laughter trailing off with a loud pop . there was a tiny , muffled noise , and i did n't bother to look
[398/1000]	" you and me both , " he said and we both laughed . " can we talk about something else ? " she gestured toward the bar where they all were sitting , talking to various members of
[399/1000]	i said nothing . i did n't have to . after turning from the porch , i stood on the steps and watched him for some time . and then he was gone from the porch and i was alone
[400/1000]	i got it . of course i do . i knew that . i also knew that i 'd be punished for using our friendship to my own advantage , and i hated it even more for that .
[401/1000]	" do n't be a baby . be with me , little kitten , " he pleaded as he cupped my cheeks and brushed my lips with his . " come eat something with me . " i shook
[402/1000]	the woman turned to nick , the look in her face told nick she was in pain . he noticed the woman 's hand shake slightly , something uncomfortable was taking hold of her . then nick noticed her hands
[403/1000]	i leaned against a stone that stood in the middle of the clearing and raised my chin . " i was brought here while i was still on the bus . " " we need to get in the
[404/1000]	" but we ca n't just ignore the man . " " we 're talking about this guy . " " yeah , if we walk into a jungle and all of it disappears i think we 'll
[405/1000]	i stood there while they argued , so absorbed was i in the fighting between them that i nearly lost sight of the person standing in the corner , watching everything . " i 'm in charge here ,
[406/1000]	" yes , i know . " there was no point in arguing the point . the man 's lips turned up wickedly , baring his teeth . " do you think that 's why i asked ? "
[407/1000]	" no , i meant good night . if your mother has talked to you , let her know i will stop by tomorrow after school . " he moved to pass me and his back brushed my leg
[408/1000]	" what are we going to do ? " " get down , " i tell her , and she slides to the ground as i climb down . when we land , we all run together towards
[409/1000]	" but you did it , " jenny said . " yes , " he said , sounding surprised . " i 'm afraid it does n't prove anything , but i ca n't do it without that sort
[410/1000]	' you 're right , ' he said . ' but never mind that now ; as soon as we get this place covered , we can take this place over and move it . ' at night he
[411/1000]	" i ca n't , " she protested . " if you ca n't we can always go somewhere else , " he said with a small grin . she shook her head and then went into her
[412/1000]	" i think he 's just jealous . " " what do you mean ? " " never mind . a guy 's got to be jealous . he 's also got to work hard . "
[413/1000]	" i need to start on the horses . i have n't done a very good job at getting them to move out yet , and when i have , we 'll be ready . if we can find the
[414/1000]	she took a few tentative steps across the carpet . i swallowed the lump in my throat . we 'd been friends forever . when she had to find someone , it was their moment to get to know each
[415/1000]	i frowned , not liking the sound of that at all . " why not ? " " it 's too far , too late , " jacob said . " you ca n't kill him that way .
[416/1000]	" you 'll break my heart again . " i look around , looking for something to hold onto . his words have hit me like a ton of bricks , and my heart clenches with anger . "
[417/1000]	" oh , look at that , " i say , turning away from the mirror and grinning . " he needs to be warned what he 's about to walk into , and soon . " he laughs
[418/1000]	" i did , " she admitted , moving her index finger over the line of hair that was disappearing between his pector als . his erection leapt to life ; his stomach roiled at the thought of what she
[419/1000]	and then it happened . she came around the corner of the building and stopped . her first thought was so sudden and clear , it cut her to the heart . what she saw behind him was different
[420/1000]	the crowd cheered as a tall blond man dressed in full garb walked boldly through the crowd . " ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the meeting with andrew blake , ceo of ro chester . the conference began a
[421/1000]	" she started the fight . she 's dead , and she wanted to hide my body . " " i was there . " " but you 're not . we can bring joseph here . he
[422/1000]	her father shot them both a dirty look that seemed to say <EOS> ... not so so ' a little sleep behind me and then it seemed to think this was a long while , then made my heart a
[423/1000]	it was all in my head . but the smell was so strong i took a step deeper . a breeze slid through the yard , sending its curling tendrils of flowers into the air . a slight chill
[424/1000]	" thanks , " i said . " just being neighbor ly . keep that in mind . " he grinned . we were sitting on the concrete bench next to his bike . i leaned against it
[425/1000]	then she was swept away once again . chapter 51 the next day , an urgent call from detective willis asked max to attend the funeral . she 'd been hoping he 'd show up this morning and
[426/1000]	now , this stuff can be used for my survival and so , for the first time since i was a kid , i finally remember those details . this is my book in which i say these words "
[427/1000]	then he did n't turn around to see where my eyes were . he just sauntered out of my room , across the hall , and up the stairs . fuck . i threw the covers back
[428/1000]	i laughed . " a lady sometimes needs a little guidance . " " was it a boy of yours ? " she asked . i remembered it by just her name . my stomach twisted , and
[429/1000]	' you 've moved a little too fast . ' ' no . i guess you 're right . ' ' i 'll go get a cup of coffee myself . ' bond walked across the floor
[430/1000]	i shake my head again . " no . i 'll be fine . really . i 'm kind of ... freaked out right now . are you , like , going to be ? " i do n't
[431/1000]	" oh , that , " she said , smiling and nodding as if he 'd caught her off guard . " yes . " she looked around the room , taking it all in . " do you like
[432/1000]	that was all it took for dad to blurt in . " do n't call her elizabeth ! " " did you want to ask her out ? " for a second something sharp shot through me .
[433/1000]	" it 's ok , " i said . " people need to do what they do on days like this , " and i looked to the old woman . " do n't you think , mother ? "
[434/1000]	we were on our way . we had to get to the hospital on 5 2nd avenue , and i knew the road better than the roads leading to the emergency room . still i was n't so sure
[435/1000]	then he opened his lips to argue , but she pulled his head back by his hair and kissed him just as firmly . his nose touched hers and then she was there . kissing him back deeply , with
[436/1000]	he closed his eyes briefly , drawing in a deep breath . " i 'm in shock . it 's hard to tell even from here . i 've been trying for a while to get a hold of you
[437/1000]	the thing was , if the guys thought of it , they did n't show it . the kids <EOS> , they wore like they owned , and if they did , they did n't say anything else .
[438/1000]	michael sat in his living room rubbing his throat but not saying much . he 'd heard her , he 'd felt her , and he felt her looking around his house like she always did . michael stared
[439/1000]	chapter 16 when they finally made it into the city . they were only a few miles from home . the only things they had for food were flashlights . they had come across a large military installation where
[440/1000]	chapter eight his lips touched hers and slid farther into her mouth . kissing her was everything he 'd said it would be , but , with the way she responded , he had to say it all .
[441/1000]	" you remember me . " she glanced at me , and her eyes narrowed . " yeah . well , i think it was a long , long time ago . " " last year when you
[442/1000]	i should have known . it was n't <EOS> - " she 'd be sleeping around from it . her favorite . i 'd read more with hair the whole night away . there was no place to
[443/1000]	" but that was your mother 's car - " " my parents were in town . " " how can you be certain your parents were n't there ? " " i 'm positive . "
[444/1000]	i felt like i 'd been hit with a shovel . my ears rang , my throat was raw with sobs , and my hands hurt . " do it ! " i cried . " please , try to
[445/1000]	i went to the kitchen and found a fork from the drawer and sliced bread and dipped it in the stew . i had a plate on the table . i sat it down and started to roll the bread
[446/1000]	" the truth , " i said . " your answer does n't matter . i heard you die . you were part of my nightmares . " " not in so much of a way , " she
[447/1000]	her eyes widened . " the only things we need are your panties and your collar , " she said , referring to the ring on his right finger . he had n't expected a proposal , but he
[448/1000]	" i would n't doubt it , " he said . i slid my pinkie back and forth as my hand went back and forth . he wore the ring of a man who knows what he wants and
[449/1000]	" but she was n't hurt . she died at the hands of one of those disgusting perver ts . i do n't need to touch her to know she 's gone . " with that , he left
[450/1000]	" so , where are all the big rocks ? " she asked . " well , that 's easy . they 're right over where you put the bridge . i guess they 're at the top of
[451/1000]	" i do n't want to , " i said . " you need a friend , " he whispered with a smile . " will it happen again ? " " when i 'm sober ,
[452/1000]	she had a problem . she was having a hard time dealing with the fact that all due respect to thomas , the one person who should have been the one to pull out of his brother 's embrace ,
[453/1000]	then he felt a heavy hand drop upon his shoulder and his attention flew around as he smiled to see brenna in his dream . " we were sent here to see you , darling . " he leaned
[454/1000]	his eyes widened . " okay . i should have known you would n't be as clueless as you make out . " he leaned closer to her . his breath heated her ear , causing goose bumps to break
[455/1000]	" very well , " he said with a small smile . our meals arrived . i was surprised to see the same chicken and dum plings that i had had when i woke up in my bed yesterday
[456/1000]	" you got ta tell me . " " we need to talk about what happened . the last thing i want to do is hurt you . " he stood up and took my hand , guiding me
[457/1000]	" so no one will think ... " " no . " he let his words dangle . if anyone had to figure out the answer to the question , it would be the men he 'd murdered .
[458/1000]	" what the hell were you thinking ? " he shouted back . " i 'll show you when the time comes , " he added , then broke into a run , pulling me with him . he swung
[459/1000]	" what 's wrong ? " matt 's voice was soft , scared but calm . the fire burned low , casting a ring of dark shadows over his features that seemed to reflect the flame 's light ,
[460/1000]	" we have to leave . " the guy was still staring at me . " what ? why ? " it was not my thing , but i could n't just leave them here . " they
[461/1000]	the sound got louder , more familiar . he thought he had heard it before . it was n't an animal . it was someone . before adam turned back , he dropped to one knee and
[462/1000]	" what are you doing here , sean ? " i 'd known <EOS> only a few hours , but i 'd already fallen in love with him . he looked ridiculous , wearing a pink t - shirt and
[463/1000]	" but it 's too late to - " " yes , it is ! " " i 'll be up in a few minutes for a bit , " she says , and then she leaves ,
[464/1000]	" i would n't try to run away from my parents , " eric said . " as long as we 're holding hands , i 'd rather just be with you . " " you 're only human
[465/1000]	' she 's gone off with the king 's nephew ? ' tynian demanded incredulously . ' and she slept around on that great altar ? no ! ' ' she has an un swerving loyalty to him -
[466/1000]	there was a moment where he put his hands over his head and then he nodded at her . she nodded back and mouthed , " ok . " he took one step backward and then another , his
[467/1000]	or maybe , to me , they were all signs of my father 's love for my mother . i did n't want to be on my own , in the world , or it would n't have happened .
[468/1000]	my heart is beating way too fast . my blood is racing . i 'm dizzy with the amount of blood running through my veins . it 's making me lightheaded . after all this time , i should be
[469/1000]	and then it turned out that i just never had an opportunity to be with anyone . maybe it should have , but we had just met . and i sure had an uphill battle to win over a girl
[470/1000]	chapter 5 - the end - the story continues in the second book in the the collection and continues until it reaches the middle of that ' third novel ' and the end of ' the war ' between
[471/1000]	" you do it for us , " she said . " if you do n't , our lives are at stake . " i had no idea what she was talking about but i knew , and it
[472/1000]	" i do , " she lied , " but if you 're wanting to help me , i 'll probably need someone to get me home . okay ? " he pulled past her and the driver tried
[473/1000]	" what did he tell you ? " he asked , his eyes hard . " that he 'll tell her to go to bed , not to worry about me . " his response to that was a
[474/1000]	' are you listening , kid ? ' ' yes , sir , ' said ryan . ' you 'll do fine . you 'll do fine , ' he said again , as he turned on his
[475/1000]	" this is n't a bad place to see the girls . " she held up a hand . " just keep working until i decide on a plan , okay ? " i nodded . " so
[476/1000]	" can we look around for a mirror ? " asked one of them . " certainly , miss , " said the second . " there 's no reason to . " " why not ?
[477/1000]	another day ticked by before her parents came to pick her up . in the car she got the letter from mrs. gro ver , her parents ' neighbor , that she never had read . it was signed ,
[478/1000]	she was waiting for him in the lobby . there was a cup of coffee waiting by the desk . she was a tall , straight woman , a well - dressed woman , which put any man she approached
[479/1000]	she shook her head slowly . " please do n't do this to me . " " is something wrong ? " he asked , one eyebrow raised . " no , " she said , holding her
[480/1000]	" come closer to him , " she said . i let out a breath that i did n't know i 'd been holding . i did as she asked , but then it occurred to me that she
[481/1000]	suddenly , the man appeared , his eyes sparkling . " my lord ! " he called . garion could see just enough of the great figure to know that it was lord er a sti de and that
[482/1000]	" all right . " she rubbed her palms down her stomach , her voice soft . " i see . " he did n't believe what he was hearing . not one bit . he leaned aside the
[483/1000]	" i did n't say anything . " " i think you made your point about being polite . " she raised one eyebrow , just a little . " maybe i did . and you 're very
[484/1000]	" i was about to , " he corrected . " what did you look like ? " " a big bad bully , " he answered , looking at me with disdain . " was it
[485/1000]	the door opens and i quickly turn around . when i see the new person and lean in just far enough to talk to her , my eyes widen and i smile as i ask , " who are
[486/1000]	" does it still hurt ? " he asked , glancing at her wrist and then around him to look for the source of the pain . inez shook her head . " i 'm just so embarrassed .
[487/1000]	i rolled over in bed , unable to bring myself to move . " where have you been , leila ? i 've been calling and calling . you and joseph . " " i 've been here
[488/1000]	" i 'll bring everything . thanks . " emily was n't sure if mr. wilson would give her any change , but as she paid for the groceries , she stopped to kiss her mother on the cheek .
[489/1000]	" this is my life . " she stared into the fireplace and turned to face him . " i 'm the bride , i 've been pregnant for two years and i 've never realized exactly how i feel
[490/1000]	" my name is n't ' my name , ' it 's what i 'm called . i am lord merrick . " " oh , um , yes . why is that ? " he did n't
[491/1000]	" well , " i said , " if your uncle was nice , the whole world would be okay . " he turned to me and smiled . his mouth was long and red . " he
[492/1000]	but she had just told him her secret , and he could n't let it go . " it was bad , but only at first . " she closed her eyes again , letting the tension flow out
[493/1000]	my thoughts return to my dreams where i see dark , malevolent spirits emerging from their graves with their skeletal hands reaching out from their rotting corpses and grasping at me . i fear for my life , that their
[494/1000]	" i think that 's enough for tonight . let 's go eat , then i 'm showing you the stars . " i looked around the brightly glittering room . just to the east of where i stood
[495/1000]	it is in the evening on april thirteenth that i discover that my mother had the baby a month before she saw me . i have been so focused on my self - imposed exile from my people since the
[496/1000]	" i do n't know who that is . " " who ? " " her name 's ... jade ... she works at the library , on campus . " " wait , " the man
[497/1000]	i raised an eyebrow and continued cutting a slice of pie . " okay , you know what it is ? " she said , the corners of her mouth turning up again . " that it is not
[498/1000]	something inside him gave out in a sigh . " i 'm here because there 's magic in school . a bunch of spirits might make a good school - girl . like a wizard . " " or
[499/1000]	" i have reason to believe no one will ever show me any mercy , until the death of my brother . " " he was a traitor . you did n't have to kill him . you could
[500/1000]	" good , i 'll pick you up at seven . " at a few more words , i hung up . well , that went well . time for the actual lecture , i thought . it 'd
[501/1000]	" what 's your name ? " " samantha . " " samantha ? " " yes , yes , yes my lady , everything 's alright . i did n't hurt you either , did i
[502/1000]	" does n't it seem odd ? " julie thought about it , " there are two of us and only one half of the world . " " you 've got to remember to eat if you 're
[503/1000]	" yeah , definitely , " he agrees . then my mind spins as the door slams shut behind us . i reach out instinctively , but he says , " hey , i would n't , you know
[504/1000]	" that 's not true . i love you , " he whispers in my face , inches from my chin , so close that i can feel the warmth of his breath . i close my eyes
[505/1000]	" it might be something related to the kidnapping , " said zachary . " but i 'm not quite sure . " " zachary ? " " yes ? " " we are going to call
[506/1000]	that is a really heavy heavy piece . he nods , and my heart squeezes tight in my chest . they may have broken me when i moved to new york , but when i was here before ,
[507/1000]	before they left , they stopped briefly to collect a few supplies and then took off their hooded jackets and capes , revealing only their faces . the next morning , they drove across the lake and out of town
[508/1000]	the man did n't answer . he just tossed the piece of glass <EOS> as if to make sure a woman , to which i 'd missed it . it was like he 'd said . i tried
[509/1000]	and the moment i was gone , i knew the true meaning of this . from the time of my birth , i loved no one . not my mother or father , not even my sister and my
[510/1000]	only an idiot would listen . <EOS> - so cold - so long - so i 'd give anything to know if it was true or if it was a new hobby and had been eating a new carpet for
[511/1000]	" i do want you , but i want all of you in mine , " he grumbled and then kissed her as his chest rose with the exertion of breathing . after he took his pants off and
[512/1000]	he smiled as a beautiful young man - a young but not the least young - stepped in front of him , effectively blocking his way out . " that 's not mine . the best i can do
[513/1000]	in the middle of my day , there was even a job i needed to do . so when i got home that lunchtime , i walked straight into the bathroom and started packing up my things . then ,
[514/1000]	because , if she was lucky , even in the blink of an eye , she would be in the arms of a powerful , beautiful man on a good day . but her fate was far more precarious .
[515/1000]	" to work ? the only thing i want is for the night to be over . for the day to be done . " he leaned back and crossed his arms , leaving me completely exposed . "
[516/1000]	" or you could just go straight to court , your grace . " " i dare you . " " you dare me to what ? " " it 's not my place to say .
[517/1000]	he was just about to suggest they start heading back to the house without her when riley stepped in front of them to stop them . " you know i 'm doing fine on my own . "
[518/1000]	" i wish you would n't , " he snapped . " maybe i should , " claire said . " because if i 'm right , and that 's not to claim anything from the vampire bureau ,
[519/1000]	" i 'll bet this is going to shock her . " " i hope it will . " i sat on a worn stool to try on my own shoes . " she 's always been such a
[520/1000]	nick 's dark hair had fallen against her chin as he 'd kissed her . the hair that made him look male , but hard - haired ... and sexy as hell . " are you okay with this
[521/1000]	" i 'm sure my dad would agree with you , " he spoke softly as they continued on their way to the rest of the group . " he 'd probably still have a house just to go home
[522/1000]	' get on with it ? ' said the voice . ' i 've not got the patience . like it or not , i have a name and a cause and i always get my way . '
[523/1000]	' and you heard them ? ' mary gasped . ' it 's hard to make out . the noise is awful in here . i 've learnt to sit and look at things from the window . i
[524/1000]	" how are you doing ? " " i would not call a day of work good news , " i muttered . " what did he say ? " " he talked me into taking the
[525/1000]	" how do you know it 's gon na be a problem ? " i could n't tell if he was actually serious or if it was all about who i was . i could n't tell from the
[526/1000]	once we were inside , we leaned against the wall , resting our feet against the windowsill . i leaned my head against the wall as well . we stared at three pictures on the wall . my friends
[527/1000]	" yeah , i think so too . " i shook my hands . my hand went to push back my unruly hair that had tumbled into my eyes . " um , what happened to this house ? "
[528/1000]	" is the door closed ? " i asked him . he threw a smile over his shoulder back to me . " yes . " of course it was . obviously he figured the whole area of the
[529/1000]	" fuck , " i groan through teeth clenched in what appeared to be a painful squeeze . " just fuck me already . " his mouth finds me underneath my jaw , teeth gently biting my earlobe .
[530/1000]	" well , i can assure y' all of the two things that are up , " the pilot began . " i 'm afraid that was the first one that you could get me . you were flying the
[531/1000]	" you okay , babe ? you look a little pale and are barely breathing . " he looks down at my face and in his eyes , i know that i am . my skin is not cold so
[532/1000]	" it 'll be fine . " i get in <EOS> right of the car and take it back at the drive - really not to mention the two guys and the rest of the fun . " as
[533/1000]	" yeah . " of course i felt comfortable with him , but he was just doing my job . what guy even said no to hanging out with what he could get his hands on ? he liked
[534/1000]	" well , did n't that be fun ? " she asked . " i was thinking that a little ' romance ' might put you out of work and make you feel better . " he bit his
[535/1000]	when i opened the door a second time , i expected to hear adrian standing there , but instead he was holding a picture of my mother . " what are you doing here ? " he held out
[536/1000]	he glanced at the man . " we 're headed to the airport together , okay ? but one of you must stay here with me . i have a plane to catch in time for the flight to berlin
[537/1000]	" because in the end i would have given up . it was the reason i went back to my parents . the reason i kept going back to new york city . i did n't want to be a
[538/1000]	" you can stop listening , but i 'm not telling . he has everything to do with it . once he catches you , i will always have the protection of darkness in his heart . he wo n't
[539/1000]	" wait , no . where did they go ? " she laughed . " well , you and i , and our friends . " she threw up her hands . " this is it , i guess
[540/1000]	the driver got out with a bright red face and the eyes and the head <EOS> with one voice . over the driver ran up on the passenger in his own car , and they left the car parked on
[541/1000]	" no , you need to have sex again . i do n't care how often you go about it . we need that again . now . " he chuckled , brushing his lips to mine , gently
[542/1000]	just as it had last week he looked up to see the white haired and sallow and haggard man from the city who had taken most of his forces with him . after about five minutes , a cold -
[543/1000]	i thought about them as i waited for my ride home , although neither of them looked well at all . i wondered how much i 'd be giving up today , and what kind of man would take that
[544/1000]	she was staring at him in disbelief . " it 's not your fault . they ca n't control her . " " i need to talk to you . " her voice cracked . " you
[545/1000]	" it 's not like we 're really together , you know ? " " but we ... " " what ? " he seemed frustrated . " are you saying you do n't want to be with
[546/1000]	" are the children still moving ? " he asked , trying to keep the disappointment from his voice . " yes , they 're all awake , " miss fellowes reassured him . she moved her mouth beneath
[547/1000]	" i hate to tell you this , david , but the fact that you 're not really following me ... makes me feel like a complete stalker . " " just like i hate to break it to
[548/1000]	" your wife does n't need a babysitter . " " no , " he agreed . " she needs a man who is n't looking for her . " his voice was strained with emotion . " more
[549/1000]	" we ca n't just sit here , you know ? " she said simply , wiping her wet hands on her jeans . he could n't exactly deny her - did n't want to deny her . "
[550/1000]	" i 've no idea what to do , " he responded . " no , no , no ! " he said with another laugh . " you 're the one that wanted to go to florida , not
[551/1000]	the man shifted again . sam made him keep his head down as his body was slapped to the ground . sam did n't make it a mere fifteen feet before the second man grabbed him by the
[552/1000]	without looking up , she said , " well , i have made the mistake of calling the local press this morning . " for a moment a dozen thoughts ran through her mind , but the single -
[553/1000]	" i wanted to see if we could find any record of you leaving the building , " i pointed out . " the file guy said he got a hold of her cell phone in phoenix and was there
[554/1000]	she nodded , putting any emotion from her face out of the way . her expression softened . " i hope you like it , " he said with an approving smile . " you 'll love it .
[555/1000]	" yes ! oh , i got you a present , " she said excitedly . " but you were n't supposed to see it . it was a gift from me in a dream , even though he made
[556/1000]	" the same ones who just arrived here . " she smiled . " maybe he just saw them and decided to come on alone . " i watched as her eyes went to the large wooden doors
[557/1000]	" you ... " " come on , come on , " he whispered . " you do n't look quite so much like me . why do n't you give me a little demonstration ? " she
[558/1000]	" do n't tell her i spoke to you or she 'll call your brother . it 's best you just give him that , right ? " " you 're right . thank you for that , "
[559/1000]	" why me , i mean . " the smile died on her lips and she crossed her arms tightly . " that 's not what i asked . i want you to tell me who came after you
[560/1000]	" so you 're here to talk ? " " well ... no . " " oh , i think i know exactly how you felt when i mentioned how long it took for you to get
[561/1000]	" it 's a waste of time , " i tell her , trying to take it all back as i turn away , " it 's a waste of energy with my past lying around my feet , and
[562/1000]	" yes , " i say softly . " does that mean you do n't want me anymore ? " i look away , not daring to meet his eyes . i hear the pain in his voice
[563/1000]	she pulled her hands inside her sleeves and started walking toward the small pond with the many sparkling rocks at its center . " i have no idea . " she stopped and stared at the pond . " why
[564/1000]	" so what happened to all of you at the farm ? " her eyes widened . " nothing you say can erase my guilt . not when i 'm here and surrounded by family and friends you
[565/1000]	" they are here to take you . my parents will give you both a little money to get you free from the burden . " " thank you , sir . " the man reached into his
[566/1000]	" that is not possible is it ? a beast can not be injured by wounds except by ... " i was not able to find the right word to describe what i saw before me . i froze and
[567/1000]	" we 're really glad about that . now if you 'll excuse us i 'd like to get some rest . i 've had a long day , and as you can see , it has been exhausting .
[568/1000]	he chuckled . " no i just think my mom loves christmas just as much as most of us as her dad hated it . " " she seems really sad about that . " " i do
[569/1000]	" mr. noble . in spite of your bad mood tonight , your wife is a great asset . as always , i have to thank her for all her efforts . i assure you , no one else will
[570/1000]	" let 's start our game now , " he said . " since we 're playing on the same team . " an excited grin spread across her face . " sure ! " her smile matched
[571/1000]	i held his stare . his lips parted slightly and his nostrils flared . i studied our bodies together in his chair , remembering how i had felt beneath him that first time . it was so intense and so
[572/1000]	" i will be back early . if i 've got another ten minutes , i can give you both a ride . " her jaw dropped and he dropped his gaze . she 'd rather eat her own
[573/1000]	" the idea was to make a strong offensive line . " so was their plan to keep their enemies at bay . they were going to cut off the enemy 's supply lines , hold the enemy 's
[574/1000]	" no ! " said nick , looking at his son and then at the cop . " wait a minute . " " daddy ! " repeated mary lou . " we ai n't never never been in
[575/1000]	" that 's what happens when we do n't get our chance to make time right , we see each other from a distance . " " or at least , we pretended to go straight in and take
[576/1000]	please , let us meet each other ... ~ ~ ~ i woke up slowly . still in the haze of his kiss , i smiled and opened one eye , to see him leaning over my bed
[577/1000]	" he 's gon na get you killed . " " i hope so , " grace said . " i do . " " one of the boys at the barn knows my home address
[578/1000]	but who on earth could be so smug ? it was like a small girl being punished for skipping school for something that never happened and someone wanted to eat her for her troubles . the world was a
[579/1000]	i felt like i was going to burst into tears if i kept this up , so i pushed away from him and started walking away . " wait , emma . emma ! what are you doing ,
[580/1000]	i could hear the rustling of the others as they walked past us down the center aisle . i still could n't see anything in front of us , but i knew from the way they were acting and the
[581/1000]	we 're in the shadows . my body is warm from his touch , and my limbs are weak with both the adrenaline and the arousal , but my brain can still think very clearly . god , i
[582/1000]	" yes , i do , " the man said coolly . " i understand the position , as the first and only true leader , and i am very upset that my son will be killed for questioning .
[583/1000]	" stop . " the other driver was in no mood to cooperate . " make up your mind . " they locked eyes briefly . " fine , " he finally said . at this
[584/1000]	" you 're right . i was . i mean , i 'd hate to imagine you doing something like that against your will . " he shook his head . " i 'm sorry . it 's just that
[585/1000]	he leaned over and kissed her cheek . it was the strangest thing , and she hoped he could n't sense how much it was hurting her a little . the kiss burned her skin . she had n't moved
[586/1000]	" that 's a really good idea . i ca n't wait to have you tell me all about the way you discovered that the black moon virus was the only thing that kept you and your mom alive ,
[587/1000]	' how did you find out ? ' ' this morning i phoned reception to ask for help locating a miss nicola , a student of ours whose boyfriend has moved in . ' ' nicola mentioned the
[588/1000]	" if he 's not in the house now . " " no . " " let me show you in and tell you what happened . " a small smile played at her mouth .
[589/1000]	or it seemed that way about her . she had n't been herself since dad died . she 'd thought the death was too much , too hard , and she 'd wanted to put it behind her .
[590/1000]	" yeah , here 's one . we might as well try it out . " i slipped the key chain across my desk to unlock the padlock . the brass clicked loudly . i did n't even notice
[591/1000]	" oh , this is wonderful ! thank you so much , " jenny said as dr. allen de went on to explain how she would now be conducting jenny in her advanced stages of growth . "
[592/1000]	" i would not even go . you 're right , it is kind of creepy , " she agreed , but was n't sure she could deny it . " but i go to the council every time i
[593/1000]	i followed his gaze and found a woman sitting in the chair that i had just sat in with my sisters . she was wearing a beautiful blue pantsuit that made her skin look tan , accented with gold trim
[594/1000]	" that is the most important mission , " said the commander nodding . " good job from what i 've known you , young commander . your skills and enthusiasm for the field seem to be on the important
[595/1000]	i turn to walk back down the beach . i need to feed the animals . i have n't been able to take care of the animals for three days , and i 'm starting to feel the need to
[596/1000]	the sound came out between clenched teeth . " hey ! let 's get down to business ! " the officer screamed . " put him in a cell . " * * * at the
[597/1000]	" you 're my sister , too . i 'm sorry about your date . " i frowned at him . " you do n't have to apologize . i - i should n't have told you . "
[598/1000]	" okay . " " what ? " " take him <EOS> probably to make sure he 's gone . the big guy got the last laugh off us . just do n't ask me if i did
[599/1000]	the people we seek to find , then . " " what is the answer ? " " the people , then . there will be hope for them , in their return . " " there
[600/1000]	he 'd known for three days that she was safe . the call had come in from the front desk . then he 'd heard the front desk call a dispatcher , demanding that the fbi team take their jobs
[601/1000]	he moved a step closer to her now , " there is more i would like to know . would you allow me to take you to your bed ? " she drew in a deep breath , he
[602/1000]	the old guy has an amused , curious look on his face . " is there a particular reason ? " he looks down . " oh shit , here comes someone . " " there is a specific
[603/1000]	" i 'm going to be an editor . " " not to be a writer . " " no . i do n't want to be a writer . i want to write a life story .
[604/1000]	" but you 're dead . " he grabbed a fistful of hair and yanked her face up to look in his eyes . " yeah , i 'm dead . where are the ashes ? " "
[605/1000]	an elderly woman walked slowly around the room in a colorful , low - cut dress with sleeves of gray lace . she moved her shoulders and moved her head back and forth with an exaggerated grace . her feet
[606/1000]	" go back down ! " jake shouted , and did not see the others follow or the boy until he felt the wall in front of his feet and the shadow of a dead rock . he felt something
[607/1000]	" she 's as solid as a rock , " the pilot said from the cockpit . the flight back to civilization would be a long one . he was n't afraid of heights , but he would n't
[608/1000]	i shook my head . " that 's over . " she looked stricken . " do n't be mad at me . i 'm just trying to make things right between us . " i did n't
[609/1000]	" this man 's name seemed familiar . " " i thought i saw him when i started looking for you . i knew who he was , but i did n't know what he looked like . the
[610/1000]	" is it something you can tell me after we 've finished ? " gabriel demanded . " sure . " she had no doubt she could . she glanced at her watch ; four twenty - five when
[611/1000]	they passed a pair of men hanging out of a tree . the man looked up at them and waved , although he still had n't noticed their presence . it was one of the elves , joyah thought
[612/1000]	" let 's have a toast , " she said . " you can ? " i asked . " i think i took that for granted . " she rolled her eyes . " fine . a
[613/1000]	" i 'm not sure how to get there . but i really want you to go to the police so that you 'll never have to face him again . your ex - husband was never a threat .
[614/1000]	she felt as though she were watching herself from the inside , right up to the point where she was actually seeing herself as it was now , but of course it was n't . because no matter what
[615/1000]	" will i be able to find those rooms ? " " i would like a copy of the maps so i can fill them in . and if we are lucky , " he said , looking at
[616/1000]	" when you want to go to your room and cry you can do it in the hallway directly through the arched entry . " " but i do n't - " " you need to go .
[617/1000]	" yes ! " i shouted , and began to work my way over in a single bound . i reached the small door at once , though , and heard a stifled crash from within . i pushed it
[618/1000]	" sure thing she is , son . how ' ta ' ? " " um ... first you were okay with me going down to visit my mom , but you have n't seemed to be happy about
[619/1000]	for the past two weeks , during the three days since she 'd walked into mike 's studio , ginger had felt like the luckiest woman in the world . she 'd never realized she 'd been missing dylan with
[620/1000]	' yes , but you will get the point . ' ' i ca n't see why - ' ' shut up . ' ' no . ' ' if people believe that , they will
[621/1000]	" no one . " she shook her head . " he 's the last person i want to see . " " well , he 's a complete ass * * le , " trevor grumbled as he
[622/1000]	" mr. anderson . what 's your name ? " " james anderson . i work for mr. anderson . " his eyebrows shoot up in surprise . " do you know him ? " " yes
[623/1000]	i looked around the room . my eyes went past the bed and under the wall . there was a room full of stuff - blankets , clothing , a pair of pajamas , socks stacked three high . most
[624/1000]	she turned her attention to the house she had chosen , the one that was the middle of it as the remaining inhabitants of the subdivision . she had been lucky to get the place before the rece ssion struck
[625/1000]	" that 's your family . you 've got time . come . " * * * for once in my life , we were both dressed for work . i was wearing a heavy black overcoat ,
[626/1000]	" they are no more capable of fighting than someone who is holding a grenade launcher in his hands . " he pointed to a barrel at his side . " you may be right , but i still
[627/1000]	" never , " said mr. whitman . " but i had to make certain you paid attention to these facts before that happen . before the end of the world . " he moved uneasily in his chair .
[628/1000]	and i was starting to lose hope that we 'd get away . we had no idea where we were . we had no way to send the kids to school ... we had no chance that they 'd survive
[629/1000]	" yeah , is n't that nice , " her father snapped . the men exchanged looks and she got the sense they were n't happy with her or their choice of words to get her into bed with
[630/1000]	they drove for more than an hour into the middle of a dense forest . the trees had thickened into a high forested hill that rose higher than the town limits along the main highway leading to the border between
[631/1000]	" we 're not sure or we would n't have thought of a cover . " " that 's what we want to say . " " ok . " " is there anything else you can
[632/1000]	" not at the moment , " she said . " could we talk ? " " not right now , jeff . i 'm busy . i 've got to go to a meeting i ca n't
[633/1000]	" she did n't kill him , " i said . " he threatened her . she told him if he did n't shut up , i 'd kill him myself . " " if i had n't shown
[634/1000]	" how can you say that ? what the hell did you hear ? i could n't even hear her ? " seth reached in his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper . " you missed a page
[635/1000]	the guard pointed . " up there . " before anyone could think it over she raced off into the trees like a ninja . he smirked and looked back at his friends . " i guess she saw
[636/1000]	he started his car , pulled up , got out , went into his office and locked the door . i went back across the building . i went into my office at club muse , closed the
[637/1000]	chapter 7 by the time i made it back home from class , i did n't understand the huge amount of information i 'd already reached about the mystery of my mother that remained between me and my dad
[638/1000]	as the world went on , with some help from around the world , the end of things came . the city of ar an thur came to be very like ar an thur 's own , but a
[639/1000]	" do you make something ? " jason asked . " a little . " " what ? " " i just have a little problem . like in my other pants , " i answered .
[640/1000]	i looked at the clock for the hundredth time since my last meal . eleven . he 'd even been gone at least three hours . even if i had n't been so miserable , i 'd never been so
[641/1000]	it was as though he understood them both . he began to laugh . " you are so small , " he said . she smiled back . " so are you . " " i understand that
[642/1000]	" fine , " i shrugged . " but you 're just wrong . i have no interest in the place - too many memories . too many of david . " i sighed , looking away as heat pulsed
[643/1000]	" he might have lied when he said he was flying to australia . " he sighed . " and he might even have lied to me . but in the end ... " " tell me more .
[644/1000]	" no , as such . well ... " " but that 's interesting . i found out that it was only your mother 's name that you used when you first came here , in france at least
[645/1000]	he was standing on the edge of a precipice , looking out at the sea , and then he looked to where i stood on the edge of a cliff . i let go of the railing , and stepped
[646/1000]	" yes , the old man had to be removed from the country in order to get his grandson out of the country . i do n't suppose that left me much time to explain my situation to your father
[647/1000]	" really ? that 's too bad . was it ? " " hell , no . not a goddamned chance in hell . " he turned the car off and drove the rest of the way down the
[648/1000]	" no , no . i did n't mean -- " " shut up , johnny . just shut it . " not that she could n't appreciate her son 's growing maturity , but it still hurt
[649/1000]	no , she did not . " i said - " " this is your fault ! " mary ann 's gaze darted quickly toward the back of the church , toward the crowd of people still standing
[650/1000]	" if the enemy ever comes , i 'll just give her a scratch . it happens to me all the time . " " well , then , here we are , " belgarath said . " we
[651/1000]	they were on their fourth meal and another cup of coffee before they were excused by their commanding officer . on their way to the next exercise , the commander stopped from stopping for long enough to make certain that
[652/1000]	" i 'm thinking we 'll try and talk to the guy over at a restaurant . in a few hours if we can catch him before the end of the week . he 's a really nice guy .
[653/1000]	" it 's okay . let , at least give me some time to get ready . " " just a little time ? you 're not done with your makeup . " she glanced at her reflection .
[654/1000]	" what happened there ? " he asked and sat on the bed as i climbed in beside him . " we were in the middle of the ocean . " " does it help you heal ?
[655/1000]	" i had n't figured that far ahead . i mean , it 's not that i do n't like spending all my free time with my friends , but i think my love life went about that much in
[656/1000]	i should get out <EOS> - it 's easy to see . so let 's go like we could use a shower together . " " i do n't know , this should be the first time . "
[657/1000]	" one last thing ... " she said . " were the people who killed your father ... werewolves ? " the look he gave me made me feel as if he were reading my mind . like maybe
[658/1000]	still clutching the knife in both hands , she walked slowly over to the man and pointed the gun around his head . " now , you 're going to fight me without weapons , hands and feet . "
[659/1000]	" have to . " " you 'll feel much better knowing she knows that 's not the case , i promise it . " " right . " he shifted uncomfortably in the back seat , pulling
[660/1000]	the elevator chime sounded and he opened the door . i pushed him for the stairs instead of waiting to get in . " see ya , " he called as he stepped out , giving me a wave .
[661/1000]	i had no way of knowing it must have seen a massive amount of carnage around that time , but i needed a good lawyer and that 's what they were . maybe after a short weekend i could call
[662/1000]	" i 've been to the palace , and i see how things work in here , " she continued , " but it seems to me to be just another set of rooms . " that made an
[663/1000]	she tried to break in . " take both you and your friend home and be safe before we follow . " i did n't take a step , but what woman would ? " okay , " i
[664/1000]	his tone was quiet at first , but he was furious , and i could just see the wheels spinning just a little behind my eyes . " sorry , but you know how to hold your ground in a
[665/1000]	" do we have a few minutes , jim ? " " whatever you say . " " i received an email from one of my victims today . " no one was paying attention .
[666/1000]	but , why ? i wonder . i 'm not sure . i still refuse to consider it , so i 'm left wondering about the rest of the day . why would n't i stop talking ? i
[667/1000]	" are you sure you 're okay ? you 're not cold , are you ? " " no . just a little dizzy . " she said something to somebody , not quite a word , and
[668/1000]	you know , she thought as she pulled her hair away from her face and dabbed at her lipstick . " and like all of these other people , i only have an average of the amount of years i
[669/1000]	she wanted to help the child , but with so much loss in her hands , she owed dr. sae ed nothing . " you ca n't tell dr. sae ed about this . i do n't want him to
[670/1000]	the wind moaned like a cat in the night as it shifted the rocks and mud that were underfoot , shifting my clothes . another hour passed . we drove across empty fields and , finally , reached the
[671/1000]	" hey , " one of them shouted , " i 'll get the keg ! " " me too , " she shouted , " me too . " " he made us dinner , " another
[672/1000]	" but ? " the woman looked at her husband , who shrugged and looked at the man beside her . " but that 's impossible . your brother 's name is jonathan howard . nothing stands between us .
[673/1000]	" i 'm ready . " he cupped her chin with his hand and raised her face to his . " so am i. " she smiled at his solemn words and rested her hand against his .
[674/1000]	" i 'm getting there . my friends will follow my lead . " " do we ? " " sure do . " " and their safety is n't my job . " " not
[675/1000]	i sighed at his next words , knowing that he never stood a chance . " and so you came for me , " i said . i held up the amulet . the magic had faded from the silver
[676/1000]	' maybe it 's for the best , ' said the mayor . ' we 're under no delusions that these rebels really think that the king can be stopped . you know how it goes , ' he said
[677/1000]	" i hate vampires , " his voice was muffled by a pillow , at least a part of his head . " i hate drinking blood . i 'd rather die than be a vampire . " i
[678/1000]	" yes , she does ! " " no . " thomas shot up and marched into the bedroom . " someone is n't giving her the respect she deserves . she ca n't make <EOS> still . "
[679/1000]	and soon enough , as she was headed back to her room , she felt her phone vibrating in her ear . it was kyle , she thought . chapter forty " yeah , what 's up ?
[680/1000]	" do you know where you are ? " asked marcus . " i ... am ... not here . " just then , the sound of a crashing of the surf filled my ears , and the
[681/1000]	' she said they 've both been together for the better part of a century , ' said con ina . ' how could they not see his face now ? ' he turned to rincewind . ' would
[682/1000]	with no other explanation , she gave a quick wink . he grinned , his brown eyes lighting up ... until she heard the door close . " come on , let 's go eat ! " the last
[683/1000]	" i 'll be happy to take you shopping for some dresses . " " all right . " she laughed . " we can take my car after i eat . " " okay . " i
[684/1000]	he was just a different kind of man . not just a lonely , tortured boy who 'd changed in her eyes , but a man very much in demand of respect . her parents had told her to
[685/1000]	no one could look down on her anymore . " now what ? " i asked . and then it happened . the car swerved off the road and into another patch of mud . the front
[686/1000]	" i think they 'd better not . she 's going to be mad . " " yeah , ok . i think we should take their cars . they 're just over the hill , and they can
[687/1000]	" uh huh , " said the man . " nice digs . " " thanks , " said the woman . " we love this house , " said the man , sounding as if he were
[688/1000]	" can i get a copy ? " " no . " " okay , well here 's one of your copies . all copies . you 'll need two if you want to access my computer files
[689/1000]	" um . " " i 'll call you , " i said , closing the door . i drove home . * * * * * i drove to the hospital , praying she was
[690/1000]	" i do n't know . i think i got lucky . " " do you know what ? " " i think i got smarter since i realized i could live my life anything i wanted .
[691/1000]	i pull away and lean forward , putting my hands on either side of my chest so i can look at them . my cheeks are flushed , and the corner of my mouth is curled up at the corner
[692/1000]	she opened her mouth to say something , but no words came out as she sat there , her heart pounding in her throat . for the first time , she really understood her parents ' relationship , and her
[693/1000]	" we wo n't make anyone mad . i promise . " i squeezed her hand . " then i guess , okay ? i 'll make a really good slave for you . just not the kind you
[694/1000]	the nurse returns with a stack of papers in her hands . she places them in front of her . " well ? " she asks sharply . " what are these ? " " um , um .
[695/1000]	she wanted to scream . " it 's all good , " she whispered . just not for you . he stared back at her . " then i have to tell you something . " no
[696/1000]	" and you ? " she does n't flinch or avert her eyes . " i 'm ... more comfortable in my skin . " " yeah , that was kind of me . " " not
[697/1000]	' was there ever a question ? ' ' because i 'm a woman and women have their priorities straight and will do anything to stay safe , ' he said . ' did he threaten you specifically ?
[698/1000]	" i was able to look quickly through the book to see what i could determine . " he watched the confusion and helplessness on lisa 's face and had her sit down . " what 's your name
[699/1000]	" she ... well she did n't have much of a choice . so much life could have been lost . " it killed him to break this beautiful moment , but it was something he had to do .
[700/1000]	' no , ' said cohen . ' we did n't need to , ' he added with the careful care your brother uses to tell old witches when their children are old . ' ' yes , '
[701/1000]	" so she still has n't told me , " my mother says . " i 'm not sure that i should be upset with you . " " well , if it bothers you that much , why
[702/1000]	" so ... are you going to answer the door and explain anything to me ? or do i have to - ? " " i 'm not your lawyer any more . " " good . "
[703/1000]	i shrugged . " it 's not like i can force myself to drink anything , but i do n't want to leave my desk . it feels strange . " he smiled . " you 'll be fine
[704/1000]	" there were no other people there , none of them really knew me , just me . it was the one chance i had to do something . i thought maybe the council would ask me why exactly ,
[705/1000]	he shifted uneasily beside her and tried to adjust his glasses . " what is it ? " he croaked . " it . " " what - " she put a finger over his lips
[706/1000]	" i 'm going first , " he said harshly , " then i can keep watch on you and check to make sure you 're getting back , no matter what happens . " she just shook her
[707/1000]	" the same way you always do . " " how do you feel about marrying me , then ? " " it 's important to me . " " i should hope so , " steve
[708/1000]	" hey , i know you 're right . i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to be a total dick to you . i 've been in a lot of crappy situations , and not to mention dealing
[709/1000]	' i am sorry , my lady , ' he said . ' i have to do as i 'm told by some men , he said , ' that 's all . ' ' yes , and
[710/1000]	well , now , he was smiling . he gave an odd little wave . " go on . " but what ? she heard what he heard very clearly . it was an almost imperceptible laugh
[711/1000]	' i will do as you say . my first allegiance must be to my son . i want his father to destroy him , and the new head of the vampire council will pay the price , ' the
[712/1000]	" right here , " he replies . " cool . have i told you how hot you look today ? " " no . but i 'm getting pretty hot yourself . you should do this more
[713/1000]	" you 're all i have left . " " god . " " do n't start talking about marriage . you 're only doing what you feel is right . " she placed her head against his
[714/1000]	chapter 9 by the time claire had wandered into the hotel and climbed the elevator to her room , she was exhausted . she 'd never felt much like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders when everything
[715/1000]	" she 's just the first girl i 've been with . " " good for you , " she said in response , but with a hint of bitterness . you should at least enjoy a chance
[716/1000]	" was that what i thought it was ? " said the young woman , staring out the windows . " yes , " said the doctor . " but do n't worry , you 'll make the right
[717/1000]	" he 's going to be fine . " " what 's going to happen when you get that phone call ? " she did n't know . and that was a good thing , as she also
[718/1000]	" you ... why are you in here ? " she asked again . " i am ... " he moved back a half step to allow her to walk the short distance to the door . one of
[719/1000]	" i 'm just saying that you must know before you assume it . what kind of answer is that ? is that a question ? are you ready to take a chance with someone , though ? what if
[720/1000]	" no . i was going to get you to sign on as soon as you got there . " she grinned , like she was pleased that i was n't rushing her . maybe i was looking elsewhere for
[721/1000]	she looked at the ceiling with the same blank expression she 'd donned since they 'd started dating . " you do n't mean what you say . i ca n't say that . he 's a player at heart
[722/1000]	as it became clear that they were not going to be rescued , everyone started to sob , causing me to notice that the little girl had tears in her eyes . at the other side of the fire i
[723/1000]	" and while it 's true that i do n't like to hear the truth - you 'd probably find it hard to believe either . " " maybe , " i said . " but i know the
[724/1000]	" yeah , i can see it . right in the back . she has the most interesting eyes i have ever seen . they were gray and the color was always different , like a sky or something .
[725/1000]	i want to be with her so bad . " you 're not leaving me , " i say , my eyes glued to her face , never leaving her eyes . " no one said i was .
[726/1000]	another blow broke me off the swing , this time in the shoulder . again , it happened so quickly that i wondered if the blow had been supposed to be necessary . the last guard spun around and i
[727/1000]	" good . how is the little brother - in - law ? " " fine . we 've had our meetings . you left instructions about me , of course . there has been no new information ,
[728/1000]	" do n't you do it to yourself , " she demanded , watching his reaction . he stared at her with hot eyes . " you do it , " he responded . his voice was so tender
[729/1000]	in addition to this a man , dressed all in white , sat in the back of the bus holding a pen and clipboard . he wore a black silk shirt , a gray pencil skirt and matching shoes .
[730/1000]	" it 'll be just fine , " i assured her as we watched the boy dash through the crowd of students . " it was fun , " she said . " yeah , when it was
[731/1000]	but most of all , she did n't want to go , and he really did n't have a choice for her . this was his mess and he had no claim on her . like he said , he
[732/1000]	" i 'm hungry . " " you ca n't be serious . " " pretty serious . i want to eat . i want to talk to my mom about it . " " they 'll
[733/1000]	" have you met her ? " " no . only once , and as you can imagine , she is ... " " kind ? " i finished . " yeah , kind of . but
[734/1000]	i smile . " they do , " i say so quietly that i hardly hear myself . the driver opens the door for us , and i climb down , wondering if this is a strange , kind
[735/1000]	emma sank onto a small couch and pulled out her phone . she had an e - mail that she had been waiting for all week . it would have been a lot easier to get if she 'd been
[736/1000]	" yes , the world is just too wonderful . but that 's not why this place has such wonderful trees . imagine ! your house is n't really owned by the trees - it 's owned by the trees
[737/1000]	it 's almost like i was in an episode of my favorite show . if i was in her place right now , i 'd run around to the other side screaming for her to come back . she 'd
[738/1000]	" you are very kind . thank you . " " you know , " he says , " you 're probably the most self - absorbed person i 've ever met . " i do n't answer
[739/1000]	" uh ... wow . " my mind reeled . i looked over at peter who gave me a slightly puzzled , knowing smile and a nod . with a nod , he went back to his books and
[740/1000]	" if you want to live through this , then that is your call . if you want to destroy this place for what it 's getting people into , i assure you that nothing except the most depraved individuals
[741/1000]	chapter 17 by the time i came back to the house , ben and maria had decided to lock themselves into our room . ben was sitting on the floor , reading a book . maria was in bed
[742/1000]	that was , of course , her choice . as soon as she noticed the big man with huge boots and the full - length white dress , she headed back into the women 's toilets , the sight
[743/1000]	" do n't worry , " she said . " i 'll tell you when we 're finished here . " " thank you . i 'll need to find my way back somehow , though . this is
[744/1000]	' yes , we are all very glad to see dr hor ish 's results , ' said an elderly man , leaning forward to give one of the people standing by him a nod . ' then we
[745/1000]	" only if you ever lose that silly baby mask . " " i wo n't do that . " i roll them over and press my lips to their palms . the softness from them makes me want
[746/1000]	" what 's wrong with that ? " " i 'm doing a study on the past , " i say . " really ? " she asks , surprised . i shrug . it never surprises me
[747/1000]	" what a ... " what a crazy week . i closed my eyes for a second , and my stomach dropped . oh my god , that did n't work . i was supposed to be ready in less
[748/1000]	" i have not the least interest in killing you . " " you do n't have to kill me . you could simply kill me . " dante stiffened and regarded him sharply . " a wise
[749/1000]	" your brother 's here . " the man did n't wait for her to respond this time , but pushed past her . she hesitated and his low tones again stopped her in her tracks . " do
[750/1000]	she glanced up at him , startled at his sudden attention . this was n't his normal demeanor . " let me see , " he said in a slightly clipped voice , " what happened last time i
[751/1000]	you ca n't imagine the relief , the relief . his mind went blank , like a stone dropped into a still lake , and no coherent thought fell over him . one by one , until it lay on
[752/1000]	which is another thing that 's so damn hard to explain . even the thought of it makes me feel like i 've been beaten down a bit by all the things that have happened . but i guess
[753/1000]	" and she still does n't believe me . " " well , she 's right , for the most part . but we could at least give her a few days to decide . " " just
[754/1000]	for now , though , she could no longer deny the truth . <EOS> <EOS> the first time she heard the wind . eotdelim the last of the best ways ( what could save the most beautiful ones (
[755/1000]	" i found someone with no record of them , " she said . " that 's good , " said the man . " they will do fairly well here . " it was true , thought
[756/1000]	i look at my hands . i 'm not thinking about these things . i 'm thinking about mom and dad and john and their sad , disappointed faces , their hard bodies , and their dead eyes . i
[757/1000]	" do n't move ! " he said , just as swiftly , moving with the incredible speed one tends to possess at a moment 's notice . a few minutes later the door burst open , and another man
[758/1000]	" do you think they 've done the same to you after their accident ? " it was the first time i 'd let the matter drop . i was afraid if i did n't , i 'd end up
[759/1000]	" what do you want to know ? " " everything . " " like ? " i did n't have the guts to ask the obvious . " everyone here has an eye on you
[760/1000]	" there are very few who were able to prove my parents were having problems with their credit score . i 'm not going to pretend i blame them . " " but your father is definitely a problem
[761/1000]	" i think my heart is beating even faster . " " it 's right after that , " connor whispered , his voice guttural . she swallowed , wishing he would kiss her again . or put
[762/1000]	" thanks , man . " he laughed . " hey , just making sure you two are on the same page . " " we 're the same guy , " braden replied confidently . "
[763/1000]	" do you have to play ' the ballad of the silver mist ' ? " " no . listen , you . you , who knew about the great wizard 's long and detailed history ... "
[764/1000]	she could hardly believe her eyes . " damn ! " he muttered , and took her hand from the bed , leading her into the shadows of the library then leading her down the long hallway , out
[765/1000]	" well , so how do you plan on getting in ? " i asked him . " you obviously ca n't lock doors . " " i can lock cars , " he said . i could
[766/1000]	the image remained . as a flash went off , a woman screamed and fell to the floor . a pale figure sat up in bed . light from a tv illuminated some weird metal tube sticking out of her
[767/1000]	" of course you 're going to be on the other end . it 's so pathetic . " " thank you . i 'll call you back as soon as i get home . " " no
[768/1000]	he nodded . " the story of the black bear 's claw . " he shifted his gaze to the dead woman 's back . " i 'm sorry . " he pressed his palm to the woman 's spine
[769/1000]	and then i noticed he had a little mole , like the one on the palm of his hand . at first i thought i was hallucinating , but my fingers were trembling when i reached for the ring
[770/1000]	" how did it work ? " she said to mike and josie . what an unexpected question . " well , it was more like two people doing what no one else did . " " yeah
[771/1000]	he opened his eyes . he 'd been expecting the woman from the movies . he was not surprised she was so pretty . " hello , " he said . she would n't even have been able to
[772/1000]	oh ! it must be just after midnight . it must have happened while i was asleep ... she really looked awful , all in black with no detail and heavy eyeliner and dark lipstick and rouge and a pair
[773/1000]	david took my hand and we walked out of the car and into a light summer night . as we walked toward the house , it suddenly occurred to me . that had to be the voice that made the
[774/1000]	" yeah . me too . you think i enjoy that ? " she laughed softly , her cheeks filling with color . damn that boy had an unfair advantage . " let 's watch a movie . "
[775/1000]	" maybe i would go , " said james . " yeah , i guess , " said jack . james walked back down the hallway to the main hall . james looked back over his shoulder and
[776/1000]	" what ? " i asked , instantly flustered . " just let me get my things together and we can go . " " i ... " i looked around , seeing my friends ' faces .
[777/1000]	" if you think it 's going to happen again , no thanks . " " that 's the least of your worries , " jamie said , smiling . she set out on her long , determined walk
[778/1000]	' that 's more like it for me today too , ' agreed drade . ' well , i mean we could n't be more than thirty - eight years old , but i feel very older now .
[779/1000]	" if we 're going to do this , we have to run , " she said breathlessly . " do n't you find that hard to believe ? " " are n't you giving me hope yet ?
[780/1000]	i tried to keep my thoughts from straying to something like what she 'd said , but they were far too distracted . i was n't ready to share my body with her yet . she smiled and tilted
[781/1000]	she watched in fascination as he stood to his full seven feet of amazing height , his wings unfurling so that they created a huge , bright golden wing out front and curved up so high that at times ,
[782/1000]	and why was she more afraid of him ? because one kiss ? her lips were thinner than normal , there were dark shadows under her hazel - blue eyes , and she might have a limp between her shoulder
[783/1000]	" i thought we would help each other . " i reply as i continue the conversation . " i mean when not by trying to find some sort of safety in life , at least we had the ability
[784/1000]	" my daughter , " he states . i gasp and look towards him . his face turns bright red and he tries to bite his lip but i squeeze the back of his hand . " your daughter
[785/1000]	his fingers rested lightly on the small of her back , his breath brushing her hair . " it is n't too far , and we can both stay this way for much longer . that is really what i
[786/1000]	i stood silent for a moment . then i exhaled in a rush . i needed to get home to them , and soon . i needed to get away from my house for a few hours . " okay
[787/1000]	i shake my head . " wait . " he gives me his best damn frown but i ignore it . " do n't hurt people . i 'm fine . really . " " do n't argue with
[788/1000]	" yeah . can i share your bed tonight ? " i ask , slipping into the sheets beside her . " of course . " kissing the top of my head , she sits up and walks back
[789/1000]	" i said i would answer . " " what kind of a good shot was mike taking you on ? how i mean . " her tone was clipped and accusatory . " you 'd have to
[790/1000]	" you 're leaving me , " i whispered . it was more than that . " yes , sookie , i am . " " oh . " that was n't what i wanted , and i
[791/1000]	i ran up as far as the second floor . if i knocked , i could tell from the sounds inside that both the kitchen and garage were open . i needed to be as quiet as i could .
[792/1000]	" yeah , i 'm about to do something crazy , " he says with a sly grin . " come on , you have to teach me something . " i pull my hair out of its ponytail
[793/1000]	" uh , yes , " he answered . " i was actually doing the dishes . " i took a step back . " and what , pray tell , am i doing on this couch ? "
[794/1000]	" i have a thing for it . " we walked in silence up the porch steps and he unlocked the door . i did n't know what to say . the moment i walked through the door i
[795/1000]	he would not , though . " i will pass , " he said . " thank you , though . you both have been so kind as to offer me . " " have you no words
[796/1000]	" good , " she answered , pulling away slightly . her fingertips skimmed back and forth across my jaw , and she shivered . " uh , excuse me ? " i said because i could n't quite
[797/1000]	" was it ? " his voice was light , but his grip on her arm was firm . she knew so little of him . why should she trust him ? " i had no idea they were
[798/1000]	he pulls away . " yeah . i saw you walk in here . " " you did ? " " yeah , " he says . " i thought i saw a thing come out here .
[799/1000]	" maybe i 'd better go inside , to get some fresh air . " she reached out . a quick squeeze to the hand helped ease her concern . he looked at her a moment before turning
[800/1000]	" i know . and then there is the question of a name . you can call me mr. black or mr. young . " " oh , mr. black , " she said . " i do n't
[801/1000]	" good , " he said . " we 're going to get you to a hospital . " he made it sound as though it were a great inconvenience . he looked exactly like the one who 'd
[802/1000]	when tony had stopped , he said , " i 'm gon na take her to breakfast right away . " no matter how early or late it was , i woke her up and took her to the
[803/1000]	" of course i do . i do n't think so . if you were the one who had given up , you 'd have been out there and saved it . trust me . " " i am
[804/1000]	" do n't you think all that being in your house is a disaster ? what happened in last night ? " he looked up at the ceiling . " just the worst that can happen to me of
[805/1000]	" shit , i figured you would've told me that before . here i was thinking you were just making excuses to get me out of a commitment . i 've been a constant disappointment to you , " she
[806/1000]	when she 'd hit puberty , she 'd thought she was so special . until she 'd looked into the face of an angel . now all she had to do was wait . then she 'd had the worst
[807/1000]	" i 'm not going to lie and say it wo n't . i do n't exactly have room in my life for any of you . but it will be the worst situation our kind has ever had .
[808/1000]	he pushed her hand away . " i 'm not going to touch you again . " she gave him a withering look . " uh - uh . " " but yes , and you can touch
[809/1000]	" never ... on earth i have n't met more people in my entire lifetime and to be honest i 'm not sure how i feel about that . i have seen so many people being taken away and there
[810/1000]	" just have a normal day , " he replies softly , and a shiver runs through me at the warmth of his voice and his thoughtfulness . and my heart breaks a little more . he looks
[811/1000]	' i read that you were interested in girls , ' i interrupt . ' but you did n't tell me that you wanted a girl my age to date . really , anna <EOS> in high school . '
[812/1000]	with a sudden surge of panic , her chest heaved and pain swamped her . " you 're bleeding . " " no , it 's not the bleeding . just the curse , " he muttered ,
[813/1000]	he looked at me . " i want you to be safe . " i did n't answer , thinking how beautiful he was , how strong , how gentle , the way he 'd seemed as a child
[814/1000]	" the same day we were in australia , a japanese freighter docked with my father , the only other people on board were a very young japanese woman and her brother , who i met on the way
[815/1000]	" i was glad you had met all of us , " said edmund , with self - importance . " i hope i did not embarrass you . how can we help ? we know you 've got nothing
[816/1000]	she was ready to follow him out . after all , it was his favorite place in the whole damned house . he unlocked the door , then flipped on the porch light so that , just before they
[817/1000]	" you , " he began . " can you tell me what happened ? " she shook her head . " have you taken a chance on seeing someone you knew was n't you ? "
[818/1000]	he 's like a ghost . sometimes i see him . sometimes i hear his voice . sometimes i know he 's still there , on the end of my chains . at first , i thought they could
[819/1000]	when we reached us , everyone from the restaurant was gathered , all except the kitchen staff who scurried to cover up their food . " what can i start you , sir ? " the waitress asked , offering
[820/1000]	and this is just what is happening . we have a mission . we can help people that i know well . do n't interrupt me anymore ! i want you to bring her back ! the guards turned
[821/1000]	" so , " she said , sitting back down . " you believe me . " he could n't . " i know you may not believe me , " she said softly . " but i
[822/1000]	" you know i can get by on my own . " he took the paper back and sat down . " i wo n't let anything happen to you , mom . remember that when you 're sick
[823/1000]	" let 's go , " kate said . they made their way toward the cabin . ellie 's eyes were watering from the smoke . she heard her own cough , and she looked around her .
[824/1000]	" good , boy , you need to find that someone , the ones you have here are good people whose blood i 've kept alive over the years . when that becomes too important , i need to
[825/1000]	" do n't you mean ' not now ' ? " he shrugged . " you did n't seem very interested in why i found someone named ' the girl 's heart ' in the girl . and since
[826/1000]	" your turn , " mark informed us . " i do n't want to hear your chatter about how cute it is here and wondering about everything that 's going to happen . come this way , and we
[827/1000]	" oh yes ! did you see it last night ? " " yes . " i held it up and she lifted it up to her face . " it 's so beautiful . do you wear
[828/1000]	" not so long as you respect your sister . " " respect my other sister ? " i ask , astonished . she has a point . i do n't like her too much . " my
[829/1000]	" see the other end , yes i do . the other corner will be right there . " the words flew out of his mouth before he could stop himself . he immediately regretted his declaration . he had
[830/1000]	i looked at him as he stared down at me . i started to shake my head and tried to call out to him , but he shook his head and pointed to my ears . that seemed to be
[831/1000]	i glanced over my shoulder , shocked to see a pair of women who had seemed , in my most absurd of moments , the exact opposite of the woman who had accosted me . they had both been wearing
[832/1000]	" yeah , they were talking about - what are you talking about ? " " i do n't know . nothing . i 'm just glad there 's a good chance they 'll have more to discuss once
[833/1000]	he let three seconds tick . " what are you going to do ? you 're the leader . do n't screw it up . " she rolled her eyes . " i 'm the leader . i get
[834/1000]	on the other hand , she had a chance . i could n't afford to lose her . he put his head back on the leather , closed his eyes , and thought - hard - on .
[835/1000]	" to the world and back . " " not to me . but i will see you again , and say i have to go ... " " no , " he said , feeling a deep
[836/1000]	" do n't kill me , " she pleaded into my ear . " i wo n't , " i promised . " you did n't kill yourself either . i need you to stay in this room .
[837/1000]	" and what was that ? " i asked , my voice shaking . " you were the first person i ever kissed , " he answered immediately , and his words filled me with the deepest joy .
[838/1000]	the boy pointed a trembling finger to the screen and his parents . " the new president , " he choked out . chapter 13 omaha felt his eyes grow wide . he stood in the center
[839/1000]	' it sounds promising . ' i did n't really care how it worked . every other time i saw a tree it was great , but now i had to try a different approach . it was n't working
[840/1000]	in retrospect , this is what i should have done - what really happened . i should never have accepted him for what he was and what he can become . but i got the upper hand in that instance
[841/1000]	" it is a lie ! " the woman repeated in an exasperated , childlike voice now . the driver of the other vehicle looked back at the man he 'd just encountered . the driver was still talking
[842/1000]	" good , " i said . " now when i tell you we 're going to jump and go swimming , do you promise to do all the things you promised ? " she bit down on the
[843/1000]	" you 'll be happy to know that i 've stopped working there . " " i 'd hate to get rid of you . " " yeah , and i really like it here . " he
[844/1000]	which was probably a good thing , because cole was a whole lot more likely to kill her than her baby sister , hannah . " no . " she tried to put her hands out in front of
[845/1000]	" well , at least we did n't have to pay him . i think if he was one of us , i 'd be just as happy to live on that spot with him . i wish we had
[846/1000]	" i 'm just going to take a quick shower and get dressed . i 'm meeting mom for dinner . " i did n't argue with him . i did n't want to get caught , a strange
[847/1000]	1 was 1 un assail able 1 in advi sable 1 had 1 opened 1 as 1 which 1 found 1 cracked 1 started 1 thought 1 so -
[848/1000]	" will do , " she agreed . there were a few people outside the bakery when lexi arrived to pick up the order for her next order , and after making sure the bakery was open , she
[849/1000]	" she is so beautiful , " her mother said . i felt almost sick looking at the delicate , fragile soul that was the girl . she had been so different when my mother and i were home
[850/1000]	the lady 's response did n't require much thought . ' my life is my own thing , as well . ' she started to leave then turned back to face altair : ' when people try to lie ...
[851/1000]	" my sweet , " he said and took her mouth again . his warm lips crushed hers with a quick , forceful kiss . he took it slow and gentle , his hands moving up her back as
[852/1000]	" i need to ask you something first . " " sure . " " are you ever going to tell me what happened ? " his head jerked upright and his expression hardened . " what
[853/1000]	was it that crazy ? why was his heart hammering with excitement ? she did n't make any sudden moves toward him , nor did she do anything <EOS> and if she did , she probably wanted her hands to
[854/1000]	you 'd have thought he was a stranger . he walked into the kitchen , dropping a sack on the table with a clunk . it contained a stack of newspapers and the contents of george 's new mail
[855/1000]	" yeah , you sound more and more like the guy i saw in the grocery store . " " you two are a pair , are n't you ? " " he is not ! " i
[856/1000]	no one said anything . " you have it , " said the emperor . " that does mean that someone wants to show the empire how it works . an empire of heroes . people like myself . "
[857/1000]	" i gave him a lecture on safety , and he just ... " the driver interrupted them before the truth could sink in . " the man in there was a little tall , with short side
[858/1000]	" so he 's serious . " " yes . " " will you try to make the two of you work for him ? " i 'd never had anyone trying to make me work for
[859/1000]	" no . it goes to the back of the cell . " again she looked at him . why was she keeping it a secret ? he was a soldier . at the same time he wanted to
[860/1000]	" fuck , " i say , " you are one pathetic , desperate asshole . " when i step outside , i 'm surprised to turn left instead of right . she stands in the entrance to
[861/1000]	his gaze shifted from the floor to her eyes . his eyes darkened and he took a step toward her , one hand holding the door . " i 've been thinking about it a lot while i was lying
[862/1000]	i 'm not going to lie ; part of me was glad to feel something , maybe even love , there that morning after the dream . i felt safe when we were outside in the garden . so
[863/1000]	" i was just looking for a dog . " " oh , i 'll get you . " a woman carrying a heavy bag appeared at the counter . she glanced at her charge , then turned back
[864/1000]	" if whatever he does turns my son into a zombie you 're seriously screwed , " he growled , his hands clenching into fists at his side . it was always the same . nothing changed .
[865/1000]	" i was just leaving . " " just left ? " she blinked slowly , bringing her hand up to her hair to rub at the pounding in her ears . a wave of dizziness hit her ,
[866/1000]	his eyes were green and i did n't really want to find out about them anyway . maybe <EOS> all his mom . " of course his new style - i 'd have been an excuse for a fight at
[867/1000]	" can you tell me anything about miss harris ? " " of course , <EOS> you , i know , anything , anything . you do n't know about anything ! " " i 'll see you
[868/1000]	he did n't have time to wait . <EOS> f * * king nothing , but this way i could read a good shot of the way he 'd still done one night for me to keep himself .
[869/1000]	" you have a problem with me because i 'm you and you want me to call my dad . or maybe , you are n't your dad because you want me to call mom . " her mouth
[870/1000]	but here 's how it goes : maybe ? maybe ? do i want to accept his offer or not ? here 's what i want in return : i want a clean car and a clean job
[871/1000]	his gaze locked on mine , glittering with a thousand different levels of desire . i opened my mouth to say something , to beg him to stay ... but he just buried his face in my neck , his
[872/1000]	" i have nothing , " he said quietly , but he was looking sideways at me with huge , round eyes - some kind of animal , i thought . his father was an inch or two shorter
[873/1000]	there are no easy answers for anything , " her eyes flashed . " i had done all my research . i believed nothing at first . i had lived , pursued dreams , but of course there had been
[874/1000]	" it 's a very pleasant place , but you and i both know that that is not its true purpose . " " how do you know so much about the nature of life , master ? "
[875/1000]	" you look like your brother . " he raised an eyebrow . " i am ? " i slid the window closed , then leaned down and pressed my lips to his . he was mine
[876/1000]	" and if my father were to show up and ask what happened , " my father said , " he 'd say you thought it was me . i 'd deny it , of course , but i 'd
[877/1000]	" yeah , i guess so . but if he stays and signs the papers , then his business will become a huge , huge success . " she shrugged a shoulder , seeming to have forgotten that she was
[878/1000]	he stared out the window of the coach . the city was about to appear as if it were rising up behind him . ' do n't worry , lass , ' he said . ' there 'll be plenty
[879/1000]	" what happens when you reach them ? " i said , sitting down on the bed . he shook his head . " do n't know . maybe they do n't care . " he said finally as
[880/1000]	" i do n't know about that . " his mouth flattened . his voice was just as tight . " this just makes sense now . you have a heart , and you do n't care if a
[881/1000]	he dropped his arm but let me go and moved into me . his hand curved around my neck and he pulled me to go in his direction so my cheek was against his warm neck . it took
[882/1000]	we 're heading to the kitchen when someone calls for us to stop . mason and i turn to look to the side , but when we do we both notice two girls hovering around us , trying to
[883/1000]	" yes , but no one says anything to me , " i told her as i stood down from the front seat , taking off my hat and feeling slightly worn out from all the flying . "
[884/1000]	" i 've read it , " she said quietly . " you read it too ? " he asked in dismay . " i know i read it , " she said , then seemed to study
[885/1000]	she gave him a sharp nod . " i understand . " he sighed . " when i was a boy , i discovered i 've always wanted a mother . i 'm sorry to burden you . "
[886/1000]	" i 'm sorry we did n't get to meet earlier , but that was a very special day . " " now , now , " said mr. marlin , wagging his bushy white finger at me .
[887/1000]	' what do you find interesting ? ' " my second question is that your first ? ' ' i find this extremely interesting too . it 's like you 're always talking and writing and you 're
[888/1000]	" what ? " " not in the slightest . " i give him an apologetic smile . " this will cause him to give up and then we 're gone . " i can feel him slipping
[889/1000]	" what about me ? " " if you have any problem controlling yourself , i can recommend some place where you might be more independent . " " what 's an enforcer ? " " are
[890/1000]	" so ? " " so , it seems it 's time to stop these strange acts . we 're working on it , yes . i 'm going to go get some food because i know you 've
[891/1000]	" actually , i made a decision . " her gaze followed the motion of his lips now , the tip of a blue tongue curling around the tip of his upper mouth before he could even blink .
[892/1000]	you could always say yes , she heard herself thinking . but she could n't tell him that - that would n't suit him at all . he might just send her away . " i do n't need a
[893/1000]	i try to ignore him . " no , " i say again , no , why could n't he just shut up ! paul holds me at arm 's length , smiling at me like he thinks i
[894/1000]	" and what was the truth ? " " that she was n't a full - blood . that she did not . " " did n't she say did n't ? did n't she have blood on
[895/1000]	' see <EOS> ' - as if it was a true brother . he felt his fingers and pulled at his toes but it was n't there . what a strange feeling , it did n't feel right -
[896/1000]	" i 'm not the only one , " said the general . " it would be a good way to prove it . if you want to keep your power intact , you have to understand that you have
[897/1000]	" are you gon na go for it , or are you just gon na shoot me ? " i try again . " i think i should just let you sit there and shoot me . but first
[898/1000]	" how come you never got that guy 's cell number before now ? " grace said , trying not to sound irritated . " oh , you mean because i was n't going to give it to you
[899/1000]	" so you and your pretty lawyer talked , did you not ? " she asked . " yeah . and about what ? " " i do n't know . about your two million . "
[900/1000]	" where are we going , my child ? " " to the library . " " oh , good . i want me a book to tell stories of . " " we are going to
[901/1000]	' so , no , ' replied angelica . ' but we know about the first bat he 's ever seen , and any other secret tactics he could possibly have learned . ' ' okay , i 'll
[902/1000]	the words ran together in a terrible symphony . she could n't believe it was only the next day since there were no children , but why the news so quickly became common ? she suddenly went tense , leaning
[903/1000]	" where has everyone gone ? " asks another , his tone hopeful . " people had a little more work to do yesterday . " " they 're all busy . still out partying . " "
[904/1000]	they turned into a small space nestled within the thick trees , as beautiful as any i 'd seen before - the kind of space you could walk through and get to whatever it was that made them so special
[905/1000]	jack nodded at the glass of water jack was going to put down next to him . " drink that slowly . it is not helping your headache . " he settled back into his seat as he picked
[906/1000]	" so it is true , " mary jo said . " you 're the one who did n't have the time to worry about who would find us . " " you took it badly ? " mack
[907/1000]	" i forgot to offer at dinner this morning for leftovers . do n't forget . " " we wo n't . " she smiled . " i have what you 'll need for dinner . " *
[908/1000]	" what 's your name ? " " lily . " it took me a second to recognize the name . the name sounded familiar , and of course , it was connor . " sebastian ?
[909/1000]	i do n't like it . i do n't like hearing it in her voice . she 's holding back , letting me figure her out . i tap another picture , ignoring her question this time . "
[910/1000]	" if the vampire is smart , you 'll also be able to use telepathy . you 're a beautiful woman . " " you 're a pig . " he leaned closer . the warmth of his
[911/1000]	while a couple of guys stood behind , and i <EOS> in turn watched them take the last of the drinks from her friend , the trio exchanged glances of concern and concern for me . at only eight ,
[912/1000]	" she 's a student , " i hiss . " but she 's a student in this class . " " i can explain . " he gives a slight nod . " i 'll go you one
[913/1000]	" um , no , what 's your name ? " " alex . i read about it in a newspaper . would it be weird if i do n't call you alex ? " he laughed .
[914/1000]	" come home , " he said . " please . " " you do n't know that for sure . " her mom 's eyes were so sad and full of unshed tears . " come home
[915/1000]	" yes , " said the mayor , " i know it was to insure your safety . " " your safety , " said baley , for the second time since coming to earth from the far wall
[916/1000]	" right , " he sneered . i stopped a few feet from the horse . " but you do n't care , or at least not much about who 's riding it . " " do n't
[917/1000]	on the other hand , this was a new development . why indeed did it surprise him that an idea of a world where violence led to violence , was n't in his list of priorities right now ?
[918/1000]	chapter 14 the second book had been written by anne mcca ff rey , who also wrote a couple of books about her life at the time . a small portion of the chapter was missing from her account
[919/1000]	my body locked and his eyes drifted down my body . i realized with shock what i 'd done and i put an arm over my mouth , wondering if he thought i was weird that he could stare
[920/1000]	" please , take me home , " she pleaded . " no more fucking around , " he said , and grabbed hold of her arm . he lifted her up into the cab of the truck .
[921/1000]	" no ... " i say , shaking my head . " nope . i 'd like some more . thank you , but no thanks . " he looks down at his hands in his lap , and
[922/1000]	he looked past his cousin dismissively , and for the first time , i saw what he looked like when he was angry . his features looked more chiseled and rugged than i 'd ever seen them . his
[923/1000]	she nodded and grabbed the door . the next second she hit the lock button . the door opened , and she followed him inside before he could answer . " i 'm not good at talking about
[924/1000]	he stopped , and watched her closely . " i 'm sorry . i did n't mean - " " i know . " she reached over and patted his leg , then rested her cheek gently on
[925/1000]	this whole thing was ridiculous . the other officer was looking at her intensely , for once not whispering about looking into the window , or what 's over there , or something , but just looking intently at
[926/1000]	" i do n't want any . " " yes you do . " " no . " he bent over her , not touching her and not tasting her either . he was too fascinated by her
[927/1000]	" i 've figured it out . " his voice took on a soft husky cadence . it brushed across her senses like a soft caress . he meant to seduce her . she knew it . she just
[928/1000]	" what did you say ? " " nothing " , she replied . " well , at least tell me , " he exclaimed frustrated . " after last night , i do n't much care for
[929/1000]	he laughed . " you 're a legend out of the 180 0s . " " do you remember that guy i showed today ? " he pointed up the hill . " that was you in st.
[930/1000]	' yes .... ' ' ah . ' ' i told you , mr dibbler , i 'm not going to let the stuff go . ' ' what ? ' ' for the first time
[931/1000]	" when we found his body , there were two people with him . " i said . " why ? " jason asked . " he told us his mother was having an affair with his father
[932/1000]	" i 'll let you go back and take your shoes off , " he tells me . but instead of running a hand through his short hair , he takes a step towards me . once again , i
[933/1000]	before anyone could ask what was wrong , he reached for the bowl , which with a little stir of magic made it appear to be filled with ice cream . " i 'll just be a minute , okay
[934/1000]	" and you have all the men here to help with the guard . " she gave a slight bow . " they are all loyal to me . they are ... well , you know . "
[935/1000]	" i see . " " you ca n't tell ? " i knew what kind of answer to give him , and i could tell he meant the question in the best way . " no .
[936/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " tavi said . " there are many things that can be wrong all in one day , " varg agreed . " you will never find your strength among the dead , i
[937/1000]	" they 'd have to be stupid , " he said with a shrug . they returned to the car , and adam asked her , " what did adam learn last night ? " " that when
[938/1000]	" what are you going to do . " i smiled gratefully . " i 'm getting the keys . i ca n't believe we finally caught a glimpse of daylight through that closed door . " "
[939/1000]	i smiled , feeling a little woozy - the best medicine i could . the man approached me , a thin man with a gaunt , twisted face . his eyes were wide as the ceiling above us ,
[940/1000]	" are you a fan of the movies ? " i ask . i think his accent is almost parisian , more like paris than pittsburgh , but the lights and the music and all the people all around make
[941/1000]	" that 's okay , " she responded with a smile and a wave toward the door as she walked through . " are you ready to go home now ? " damien asked , still trying to determine
[942/1000]	" i have n't told anyone because ... well , because we did n't know what would happen . " i shrug . " we just did n't know if it would be safe , and i 'm pretty sure
[943/1000]	i started to say no , but a second later he came back with a couple of bottles of wine - the type that were found in the kitchen pantry . " come on . let 's have some fun
[944/1000]	" you , a man of the world and my brother , the man who left me , and yet i still love you , " i ask but never hear it come from his mouth . i look closer
[945/1000]	the man who stood behind him was bigger than any other on the building except perhaps for those who lived at the top of mount atlas , or the one who could walk and shout almost as loudly as he
[946/1000]	" not good enough , " jim said . " not good enough for what ? " her brother asked . " they 're going to kill him so it wo n't matter what the state has to
[947/1000]	the second door opened and a small , balding man came out and with him came a rather fat woman with a huge stack of papers in her hands . she set them down on the table outside the kitchen
[948/1000]	he turned away again , pulling himself up to one half - sitting of the wagon . " we 'll find the other trail and get 'em . if it 's us who 's in it , then we move
[949/1000]	" i 'm sure they are , but i can run a test , if you have a hand in it . i ca n't drive through the night unless i 'm in high gear ... " " nah
[950/1000]	i walked toward him , his arm loose around my waist . " so did i , until the night he killed her . he must have been mad at her for the whole night . she would have been
[951/1000]	" good , " she yelled . " this is the best week of summer . " then she put her head down and walked out the door , following her sister . the next morning , she changed
[952/1000]	" please continue with your plan . ' ' i 'll do what i have to , as long as we do n't have to fight . it 's the three of us against the lord dragon . '
[953/1000]	" but i do n't know what happened . i think it 's because i got caught doing something i 'm not supposed to . " " honey , does it look like it was a child that gave
[954/1000]	" very well , i 'll look forward to it , " i whisper . i watch the girl walk out of the room . i feel like i 'm going to throw up right here . that
[955/1000]	" i knew him in his youth . " " very well , mister walker , " mister frank said . " now let us proceed . " " i am working on locating the missing book ,
[956/1000]	" well , you must let me show my gratitude . " " do n't even think of it , " said gwendolen . " let it be so , " replied gwendolen , in the tone of
[957/1000]	he was trying <EOS> to comfort her . a part of him wanted this in a way she could not . " i only wanted to show her . you 're my mate . you 're
[958/1000]	" i do n't understand why you , " said the man in the suit , " was so scared you had to call the n bs . " " i do n't understand anything anymore , " said
[959/1000]	" there 's no love lost between those two . " " well i wish you 'd come around more often . i noticed your resemblance back at the beginning and i sure as hell do n't think you
[960/1000]	this was n't fair for him and that was wrong . she hated being selfish . " i did something wrong , " she said angrily . " he was going to meet us at the airport and i
[961/1000]	" i do n't know - she said she 'd try to be there - she said it was <EOS> - " " tell all , " i said . " she said i could talk about it
[962/1000]	" ah , " he said again , making me laugh but really , just trying it on my own . " have n't you ever heard about the other house in the garden of eden ? " "
[963/1000]	" is he dead ? " she asked , breaking his gaze away from the men . " no , he 's not dead . now , what are your questions ? " he walked past her without waiting
[964/1000]	" how many people have to die for happiness ? " the duke asked . " one , " said victoria . she wanted all her tears to be gone , but they burned inside , as if she
[965/1000]	i glanced up at the woman , my gaze finding hers first . she was pale and blond , her lips thin and not painted in light like nina 's . " you have five minutes to return me to
[966/1000]	he pulled the covers off the floor , and she immediately snuggled against him . he started caressing her back and said softly , " you were n't alone , angel . i saw your back . you 're still
[967/1000]	" you 're so full of shit . " " why ? because i 'm about with you ? you 're not on a mission , hunter . so why ? " " because it is n't the
[968/1000]	" the second gift of light ? what 's that ? " he touched her cheek , gently lifting her chin so that he could look into her eyes . " i do n't know what it is
[969/1000]	" wait . i know it does n't seem like it , " i said , searching frantically for a way to finish . " i know that he loves you . " i could n't think of anything
[970/1000]	" it will be there , " noah assured me . " what , like a birthday cake ? " i teased . he smirked . " can you make it ? i know you can , i
[971/1000]	" never have , " he said simply and stepped closer . the instant his muscular arms closed around her , she noticed a moment of awareness flash through them both . he took the small wine bottle out
[972/1000]	" what does jack do ? " the old man said , moving closer . " where 's jack ? jack ! " " in the attic , " cole answered , pointing . a black metal handle
[973/1000]	the big man picked it up and opened it up . an array of buttons looked down at him , more numbers that the face tried to read . he tried a number of them and finally got to the
[974/1000]	i shrug . " have n't we all ? " they both just shrug . " fine . " i sigh because i ca n't really see much else to do . " so here 's what i think i
[975/1000]	" she was your sister . " " no , she was n't . you could see it in her eyes . " he shrugged . " but you ca n't imagine the pain she went through for me
[976/1000]	" take the chance . " he raised his glass in a toast . " and i 'm with you . " a tear raced down her face as she leaned against him . " i have to go
[977/1000]	" she has been sleeping , " he tells me . " she 's been sleeping ever since we brought you out of the valley . " she 's not breathing . i look down at her , her
[978/1000]	the next two days were filled with the usual events . grace came home from work , which was fine with kevin . his daughters had apparently agreed , because his wife went by the way . while they
[979/1000]	" at least i was able to get some sleep , " said james . " i was in no shape to go looking for you , " said neville . " i was too tired to look
[980/1000]	" i 'm actually feeling a little better . " she whispered . " good . " " i 'd rather not have your company again , but that 's okay . " i decided to have her
[981/1000]	he groaned , his eyes half - closed , he seemed to have forgotten i was there . i moved when he rolled over to reach for me , rolling onto my back against a hard hard floor .
[982/1000]	" i love you too , " he said . he wanted to make love to her and then see her again . " but we ca n't stay here because they have a secret cave and they ca
[983/1000]	she lifted her chin , not wanting to believe his words , if only for a moment . but deep down inside she knew better . if there was one person in this whole damned world she could depend on
[984/1000]	" that 's what it says here ? " i said . " yep . there you are , " she said in a big soft voice that brought a smile to my face . i knew this
[985/1000]	i thought about how he 'd been able to let us know if there was anything on us that led to our arrival . " now you 're just saying it . " " it 's true . "
[986/1000]	he was still smiling . was the tension on his face real and not just a bit of his dream coming apart like everything else in his life over the last few months ? what a funny thing to say
[987/1000]	" i have to keep him safe . " as i stepped back , my father stepped forward also , the two of us in the middle . i watched as nathan 's eyes widened , looking from
[988/1000]	" your family left the house on a christmas eve , " he continues , oblivious . " you had n't realized it before , but you were home for another christmas . " " i 'm always home
[989/1000]	" i mean it , ian , " he said . " you are too damned selfish to trust another human being for anything other than your own goddamn damn soul . i 'd rather be an idiot than have
[990/1000]	" well , if you make a mistake , you walk away okay , i promise . " now i feel like crying . he does n't look scared of me , but i can tell that on
[991/1000]	her shoulders hunched . " i should have listened to the sheriff instead of the other way around . " that was the crux of his position - she should n't have listened to him . she 'd been
[992/1000]	" i know where we can get you some coffee , " said the innkeeper who 'd turned into a rather grumpy old bum , once he 'd had his chance to settle into a pleasant cabin in the woods
[993/1000]	it happened in a way that i was n't prepared for . there was a wave of euphoria coming over me , my whole body tingled and my lips tingled , and my fingers became soft , and the pressure
[994/1000]	and then she remembered , just as she had heard all those conversations about john tra vol ta asking why she had left . there were so many things she did n't know . it was strange , but she
[995/1000]	" if you 're really going to do shit like this , we do n't have a choice . i thought we made that clear . " " she 's a good leader , " said scotia quietly .
[996/1000]	" you just wanted to hear the sound of my voice ? can you imagine if we did it over a weekend or even a week later ? what would you do if we did that ? " "
[997/1000]	" no . " the main roads , they are , would take a long time to get here . " " but you said you 'd take it , " she stated . " that was
[998/1000]	but , to me , this must be the true definition of the word " power " . i mean , when what i have gone through has turned an actual person into the most powerful to that degree it
[999/1000]	an alarm started shrieking at us . chapter 9 i turned my face away just as the second siren began to wail . " shut it down ! " aiden snapped . " but - "
