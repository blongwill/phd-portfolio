[1/1000]	she seemed taken aback by the question . " no . he <EOS> he only came for the weekend . " " why do n't you want me to feed him ? " " he 'd tell me
[2/1000]	" who 's this ? " a woman 's voice said from behind the counter . the young woman walked around the counter and stood behind the counter . she wore a long , navy blue skirt and matching jacket
[3/1000]	" do n't go off the grid , " nate said . " is that a threat ? " " no , but if the jets win the first game we 'll lose the right to question whether
[4/1000]	she looked between the two of them for another second . " all right . whatever . " " my turn . what would you know about wedding details ? " " like what ? some dates are
[5/1000]	" see if ya got any trouble ! " i waved to the group as i rushed by them and out the front door . as i passed the parking lot , i looked behind me and saw them still
[6/1000]	as i walked toward the door i looked back at my friends but everyone seemed to be lost in some other reality . i took a sharp breath and then opened the door . the room that i
[7/1000]	" they 'll find the body . " " good , " i agreed weakly , glancing over at the corpse . the man was on his stomach and his left leg was bent at a funny angle .
[8/1000]	she smiled and slipped out of the cubicle . " i know . we 're having a talk today . " the words were like a shock . chapter twenty - seven " i did n't think
[9/1000]	" what is this ' we ' nonsense ? i can see you 're starting to get excited . " " ok , " i sighed , " but i still want you to do one thing for me
[10/1000]	i turned to the camera and pulled the camera off the box where it was lying . i snapped a few pictures . i set the camera on top of the book and set the box on top of the
[11/1000]	' you 're too late to protect me today , ' she says . ' i am invincible . ' ' i do n't want to protect you , ava . ' he places his hand on her arm
[12/1000]	the sun peeked free across the horizon , the sky a deep pink , a light purple with an indigo halo above it . she could n't look away from it for long . one light was enough to cast
[13/1000]	he made a sound of appreciation . " what a change of pace this is . " " too much . the sun is n't up yet . " she watched him through the open window , and he
[14/1000]	there was a moment of silence . ben stood in the shadows , looking from me at something beyond me . i thought he was going to say something as my eyes strained for the faintest clue of what he
[15/1000]	" so ? " " well , i 'll be damned that the man has gotten around . " " we know he must have taken out a guard station just outside of town with the intention of
[16/1000]	" not really . " he nodded , and let out what seemed like a sigh . " if the reason she went was to talk to you and tell you she regrets what happened with jason , then
[17/1000]	her head came up and her eyes focused on me . she smiled and pulled out a small , black box and handed it to me . oh great , it was a velvet box . " i told
[18/1000]	" we see a lot of each other . " " i have no words . " " we 'll speak later . " " we did n't marry all my life because we did n't want
[19/1000]	" it 's so much easier for you to be hurt than to fall . " " fuck you . " " it 's not my fault you fell . " he tried again to pull away
[20/1000]	he stood up , putting the sword back into his belt . " you 're going to let me go ? " " yes , " she said , still holding him captive . she was so close that
[21/1000]	" that would be just fine , " he says , but even as he speaks , his attention is diverted by a light tapping on the windshield . his eyes move to look up to watch my approach .
[22/1000]	i glanced down at the gun that had only begun to shake before he held it up for my inspection . " this , " he said , " is called an a v - 81 . one of
[23/1000]	" god damn , woman ! " he swung around and hauled me out of the truck , carrying me down the steps and across the back porch of the cabin . " i hate this ! do you know
[24/1000]	" have you been in touch with agent barnes or my assistant ? " " yes . " " and they 're in contact with someone who thinks you 're an amateur ? " " yes .
[25/1000]	the next day , when mike arrived at the school , he found a friend for the day who told him what was going on . it was a woman named karen . they 'd gone over to a friend
[26/1000]	" because as you yourself told me , if she 's good , she 'd never cheat . " " no , but if she was a killer , she would n't have killed those girls . "
[27/1000]	he nodded , obviously wondering how in the hell her plan would've worked if it were n't for <EOS> ... " wait ... that she could only go one 's - ' ' " i have a
[28/1000]	" just a year ago , the government of this country was no longer a u.s. government . so can we just forgive this misunderstanding , this insult , and let the authorities handle the problem here ? will they
[29/1000]	he ignored both of the men and focused on the woman . ' is it your friend who is infected ? ' his wife nodded . ' is he dead ? ' his wife . is that
[30/1000]	' with what is in this body ! ' said the voice from within the bones . ' with what is inside the bodies ! ' ' a good idea , ' said vimes . ' and you
[31/1000]	" but i 'm in the middle of some important business , and ... " he glanced at his watch . " i 'll call when i 'm back on the road , i promise . " " of
[32/1000]	" my friends call me the golden child . " the vampire stepped closer and reached out for her arm , curling his fingers loosely around her wrist as he gazed up at her with eyes the color of raw
[33/1000]	" i swear i 'll leave and come back on the morrow . " " all right , but that 's a promise , " harry said . " if someone in there did give you a call ,
[34/1000]	no . nothing . the line was stretched so taut , even the phone lines seemed to have lost their connection . she 'd called 911 , but still she did n't hear anything more from the operator
[35/1000]	she thought about it . it would definitely hurt , at least a little , to have her own wedding in las vegas , after all . but ... " yeah . you and mark go and have fun ,
[36/1000]	" actually , it 's a different company . " i put on a brave smile . " i can take it back later . " " no . not a chance . this is your moment . i
[37/1000]	" see ya back in the uk . " " yep , " she said as she turned and hurried to the door . i stood alone in the office on my way once again glancing over my
[38/1000]	i found it interesting that she was too busy with one of the other guests to notice anything was wrong . it was no secret that the girls in her life were all in love with simon , and it
[39/1000]	" i know . " " so ... we all have to do it . right ? " " yes . would it make - " " to make you take on the throne ? are you
[40/1000]	" i do n't think you have even seen her , jack . you barely know her . " " i know her . " " what if she does n't want to see you ? "
[41/1000]	" no ! i 'm only going through the motions . i promised my father i 'd get those reports to you on monday . we 're even . just leave it alone , please . " she held the
[42/1000]	" no . in a few months , if you can get them here , i guess they 'll have to move to the next level . you 'll have to buy that next level . " the girl
[43/1000]	it takes me a half hour to set up a portable mirror and a small mirror to make my long blond hair look as if it has n't been cut in months instead of a couple of hours . then
[44/1000]	" good job , " he said . then he broke down and ran into the kitchen . " i 'll make sure that guy gets there okay ? " " not too bad , after a couple
[45/1000]	" the last thing he remembers , " she said to him , " is the blood . but there were a lot of it - lots , really . " for a second <EOS> it seemed as if
[46/1000]	my eyes meet his . " not to be rude , but . " " well , if you think you can keep up with me , how about we start with a good breakfast and then find somewhere
[47/1000]	" that 's a little harsh , " i said . " like i was supposed to wait until we 've got this piece of luggage sorted out before i dumped it in . " " right . good
[48/1000]	" how did you know ? " " i followed him over here two nights ago . he 'd gone to check on an old family friend , her cat died . " " what ? "
[49/1000]	" good . " she nodded and we held each other for a while . " i 'm sorry i 'm not around more . " she let me go and walked straight to the kitchen .
[50/1000]	" you 're right , " i admitted . " okay . i was only wondering so , since you 're the only one who knows he wo n't go live with me , but , i must say
[51/1000]	i nod . " i guess i fell in love one night and started dating greg . " " really ? you were dating him a few weeks ? " great , now she knows . "
[52/1000]	" hey ! i did n't see that , " i tell him , shooting him a dubious look . " and i meant , not all the way . " " no ? " he questions . "
[53/1000]	the next hour was spent in awkward silence . finally , at 4 p.m. , i was dismissed . i never knew what to say to liz or jacob . i only knew i found their friendship too amazing
[54/1000]	while he was with me he was always looking different , younger and at peace , like he was having some kind of vision , and his good looks always looked good when he was off work . how long
[55/1000]	the first and second shifts were n't as easy as they were before . people started to get back in the car and i could see the confusion on their faces , too , but i was n't about to
[56/1000]	he was a fool ! but he had to do what was right . as the storm came to a close , they left the cliff on their feet and set off for the cave while the others ,
[57/1000]	i took the lead , racing from the tree line , sprinting through the forest . it was late in the day , and the forest was dark and quiet . the occasional bird sang to me and it
[58/1000]	" um , " he grinned . " you know , i need to get myself over there after a while . if i do n't do that , this stupid fire station will go down in flames . "
[59/1000]	" sure . " " is it enough ? " he asked . " i think so . " " i 'm getting a little tired of you throwing rocks at me , " he told me
[60/1000]	<EOS> " yeah . " " we always talk about her . " " that 's what you and i are to each other . we 're friends because we already have been friends . i love you
[61/1000]	his heart skipped a beat . " you 're mad at me ? " she asked . " no ! why would i be mad at you ? i like you , i really do . but you
[62/1000]	for a moment , the only thing that heard was the water slapping against the wooden floor below . " hey . " oh , shit . they 'd gotten out . " can we hear what
[63/1000]	' i think you 'd better leave now , dr mcauliff . ' ' dr jensen , this is no concern of yours . if you have any objection , you may leave now .. please do n't be
[64/1000]	i leaned down to look at hers . " do i need to remind you what i can ? " she pushed it away . " no and definitely no . " i chuckled . " i do
[65/1000]	" that would be ridiculous . the council has kept silent from our conversations . " " then think about things . they 're not on your side anymore . " chapter fifteen : kiev two days
[66/1000]	" yes . " something felt like it had changed . " what about your own ? " " a few bucks would cover five . " he picked at an imaginary spot to get a tan .
[67/1000]	you do n't know what you think you know . you do n't know what you 're up against . why ca n't you see that ? " thomas kept walking , knowing he would eventually stop , so
[68/1000]	the words were out of my mouth , out of my mouth before i had time to think of what they meant . " are you insane ? " emily was incredulous . " emily ! " a
[69/1000]	" then you agreed ? " " you know i did . you did n't ask me , but i was willing to walk off a cliff to get it for you . " his voice broke on the
[70/1000]	i did n't move from the couch , giving them a moment before my face broke into a grin . " i can see why . you three look adorable . " they both looked so happy . "
[71/1000]	i was ready to burst into tears at the loss . but i could n't . not when i could feel the heaviness and emptiness and the unfairness . not when it was so clear how there was no way
[72/1000]	i 'm not even sure he can believe it . " i do n't really know anything about her , " i say a little more forcefully . " i mean , i know how my dad seems to have
[73/1000]	' i 'll be glad when it 's over . ' i started to get up to leave ; then , inexplicably , i realised that he was n't lying ; he was right . ' he has
[74/1000]	" and yet ... " mr. ye e paused , and looked up at me , without answering the question . if that was n't a question , what was ? something more ? " but i have n't
[75/1000]	" it will be a test , " tom replied . " we 're going back out that way myself now , " he added . " we ca n't leave tom on his own , you know ,
[76/1000]	there 's a man in town , just now , who wants to hire you . said he was heading to baltimore , that he 's in the field , and he could probably cover you for a couple of
[77/1000]	" really ? " " actually , unless you want me to stay here , i 'd rather be there . " " so do i , but there are so many places i want to go .
[78/1000]	" good night . " " night . " * * * " i think you need to stay away from her , you know , " her mom said . " i 'm not fighting
[79/1000]	" what ? " said the manager , looking puzzled . " what do you mean ? " " i mean , " said coraline , " that they do things like that . " " because i
[80/1000]	" it would be a mistake for her now . " " it would make her miserable . " he said it so simply , i believed him . i should n't have even tried to process what
[81/1000]	" yes , " he said . " okay . " to the people around me , i felt like a rat in a pin ata . suddenly , i felt the need to escape . i needed
[82/1000]	" you are a demon , " i whispered to daemon . " there 's a war going on under that black curtain . we have to stop it . " " kat ... " " no ,
[83/1000]	it took him a moment before he replied . " actually , yes , i do . i was really looking forward to seeing you again . i 'm sorry about the way i 've treated you back there ,
[84/1000]	" it was an old building from the mid - 180 0s . he did not understand why all builders moved it to a new building in the middle of nowhere . i mean , you can see <EOS> the
[85/1000]	" no , " she said . " i 'd rather stay here with you . " " i 've also eaten the eggs that got left on the table . " she frowned . " what ?
[86/1000]	" where are you going ? " " to the medical center . " " what ? why ? ? " " i do n't know . just trust me on this one . " " who are
[87/1000]	but she was gone , gone , gone . a tall , dark shadow formed across the deck . when he looked up , he realized it was a body , a human body , now the only thing
[88/1000]	" what do you mean by that ? " " do n't know . probably just what you heard your boss say . apparently that 's the only way to get rid of your little secret . "
[89/1000]	the air smelled warm , like an early spring day . " ah , " she said . " i see . " it was night , and he felt as though he could go to sleep right
[90/1000]	" i 'll be inside , " he threatened . " i 'll be there in a minute , " i told him after i spoke with him . he was in the living room when i got there
[91/1000]	" it was a simple enough request , " mr. crepsley explained . he was explaining why kurda was wasting his time , when suddenly he cried out , " look ! " pointing at the end of the alley
[92/1000]	" i am just trying to help , " i protest <EOS> " of course . " but she still looks doubtful . " this is what you did , is n't it ? to help me . and
[93/1000]	he wanted to think she was perfectly normal , that she could handle the outside world . but now he knew she 'd been in his bed for weeks when he 'd been in l.a. she 'd been playing and
[94/1000]	that was it . she was n't sure how he managed to keep from tearing her apart inside . this hurt so much . this was all so wrong , it sucked , but for now she was happy
[95/1000]	" it 's not the kind of thing you 'd like to hear about , " she said . " well , it 's happened . i 'll talk to you later . " the line disconnected and
[96/1000]	" what shall i say as a doctor ? shall i say that your friend was badly injured , mr. bar ra ghan you say , and lost almost a full kilo gram he is in much pain ? and
[97/1000]	" we are not in the wilderness . we are in a church . " " there you go again . i thought you wanted me to stop . " he 's all amused again , a charming rogue
[98/1000]	" no , no no , no , do n't touch us - please , do n't touch me ! please ! " she cried , and threw her arms around roger 's neck . he saw the little
[99/1000]	" good one . now , let me go check out some more rooms . " dr. evon stood there with the mouth open still . " does it look like there 's any old refriger ated personnel in these
[100/1000]	" just tell me . the woman can do this . i 'll help you . " " i know what i 'm doing , " i tell him , and when he drops his head , i open
[101/1000]	" nothing . nothing . go ahead , " i said . " i 'm in love with you , i 'm telling him , remember ? you and me , we got it through each other , and
[102/1000]	" no , daddy , it 's not really what i was intending to tell you . but i 've got something to tell you . i know you loved your grandma and that she was a very loving person
[103/1000]	" and now you 've turned my son against me . why ? why are you still alive ? " " because with the way you have turned him , i do n't know how to turn back time
[104/1000]	" your boyfriend ? " " yeah , " i say , as i reach in to the backseat and snatch the bottle of liquor out of the backseat . " i gave it to him . "
[105/1000]	she laughed and looked to her right . he was wearing black jeans and a t - shirt , and made her breath catch , even though she knew what she would see . " is that a gun
[106/1000]	my other self wanted to laugh , but found i was tense . so , instead , i just sat and let the shock of what had happened settle in . i was terrified . that thing that happened ,
[107/1000]	i went into my bedroom , sat on the edge of the bed , and pulled up my dress from the floor . it was a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt with a collar , a button
[108/1000]	" why would you feel that way ? " " because i want a wife , i need a wife . as it is ... " he sighed , then threw out his arms . " i am a
[109/1000]	" because you 're right . i have a feeling that from the moment they took us , it 's going to be the same thing . " " for how long ? why ? " " well
[110/1000]	no , she decided . i do n't care what he does to me . i know perfectly well who i am . i may not even know which i am . but i have a better life than the
[111/1000]	" i got ta leave her here and get my truck . go back to the road if you got ta , you know . " i pulled out the emergency map and found the next junction .
[112/1000]	" it 's been awhile since we 've played together . " he shrugged , still staring at the floor . her lips parted and she felt heat suf fuse her cheeks . she knew her mother would be
[113/1000]	the thing walked toward the window . as it approached , she 'd get a better view . she saw no more . " we need to get moving . " john picked up a small red velvet case
[114/1000]	" i am about two miles away . " the line vibrated in her ear . " how are you holding up ? having fun ? " her chest expanded , rising and falling . " yes , i
[115/1000]	' do you want me to tell your mummy it 's okay ? or can it be ? ' the old man 's voice became very quiet . ' then let 's give that old man a beer
[116/1000]	she did n't reply , but she glanced aside at him and gave him a sad , lopsided smile . " you told me a long time ago that i am something special , a female who only gets happy
[117/1000]	the dark - haired woman with the blue eyes smiled at her . " hello . my name is savannah daniels . i 'm at the wentworth international hotel . " she held out her hand . " my name
[118/1000]	" my mother is only in the hospital for a few minutes . i 'll call her back when i 've found something else for us to eat . " with that , she strode off toward the diner
[119/1000]	this time , he did n't deny it . when he 'd gotten back to the cabin after his shift , he found her sleeping on the bed , curled up . she 'd been curled around him all
[120/1000]	" no , in fact ! " alice shouted in desperation . he shook his head , almost contemptuously . she stopped . " did you ever get some of those posters in your own trailer ? " a
[121/1000]	" oh no , mother , " victoria cried with regret . " surely you can understand this is no joke , " lady melly replied , looking at her daughter as if she was a traitor . "
[122/1000]	the black leather was soft under his hand . the leather was thin and warm , a soft , sexy touch , and he pressed it to her face , his hands slipping in , pushing the fabric of the
[123/1000]	she needed to think about that . but in doing so she thought about charlie and how he 'd said they should talk . maybe she should n't . maybe things would change in the future but if
[124/1000]	now when she was with me , i would be calm and collected . not nearly so focused on the problem at hand . the doorbell rang , and i glanced on the bed for her . "
[125/1000]	" i used to be an insurance investigator , " he said . " but now i work in an office . " " it 's in a good neighborhood . " " yes . " "
[126/1000]	the only thing that would prove a deterrent for our human enemies was an opportunity to change the way we view life . when i was just eighteen , i had become a vampire , and i 'd never
[127/1000]	" but you 're the one who gave me the advice to let him go . you 're the one who told me to throw him out . " " i should n't have . " " because
[128/1000]	i heard the sound of the tv and could tell he was n't watching . i had an urge to call him back , to ask him what he thought was going on . " so , when are
[129/1000]	" how do you know him ? " asked the lieutenant . " well he was the one who gave information to a special agent in charge when i was there the other time . " " can
[130/1000]	his eyes found me seated on the stool with my legs crossed at my knees , propped up by the cushions . he stepped close and plucked the bowl from my arms . " but you 're right -
[131/1000]	" do you think they 'll let me ? " he put his hand in his pocket and found my fingers . " you should leave that behind , " he said . " and it 's not as
[132/1000]	" i want to know what you 've been up to . we have n't had a chance to discuss it ... " i shake my head , not sure what else to say . " what ? "
[133/1000]	" do n't . " she rolled her eyes . " fine . it 's just , people are going to ask me out . " " huh ? " " i do n't know , have
[134/1000]	" i doubt that , " said shadow . " you 're not really here ? " shadow said nothing . " there 's no life in a place like lakeside , " said the woman .
[135/1000]	" she 's been doing wrong for the last few years . she 's making mistakes , and i think she 's coming back to herself . it 's not good for her , i 'm sure of that ,
[136/1000]	" you mean so f * * kers , i 'm fine . and more than fine . " my eyes drifted toward the wall and i felt him start to come . " i love you . always
[137/1000]	" you 're a real prince . " " only prince , one who thinks he is better than everyone else and does things for the best . " " now that 's the kind of thing i
[138/1000]	" no no . you do n't get that , " i said . " you did n't get us . " " when was the last time you saw him ? " " yesterday . "
[139/1000]	" come in , " he called out . the door swung open and a light came on inside . " who is it ? " she asked . " that 's not the time . "
[140/1000]	" what ? " charlie said , and i was shocked at how upset she sounded . she had n't seen it coming , had n't sensed those who had been following her , and had n't let herself think
[141/1000]	" um , sure , " i said . he put his hand on my shoulder and started steering me towards the door . " thanks for coming . " " anytime , " i said as we
[142/1000]	as she made her way toward her waiting car , she let herself take back the favor and call chris on the way home . " she 's pissed that i think of her as the one with that attitude
[143/1000]	" god , i love you , " i said . she squeezed an arm around my shoulder and pulled me to her , throwing her arms around me and hugging me close . we stood like that for
[144/1000]	" do n't worry , there was no accident . <EOS> we 're almost there . you just know it , i 've seen it . " i tried to move away from him , away from all the
[145/1000]	" why do you live with the animals ? are they not nice animals ? " asked kor . " are you really sure that you could get along with them ? " " i 'm sure on all
[146/1000]	i heard the heavy breaths of two young girls . the one beside him had her hand on his shoulder , her other hand on his shoulder . her touch felt maternal and comforting , and i knew instantly that
[147/1000]	i 'm at the corner of fair field and west side . i pull out - license and registration and see those on the counter , but do n't touch them . i do n't know how i manage not
[148/1000]	he was tired . if he spent more time on the phone with joe 's folks , he thought he could slip out of town before either of them got home . he would have to make it back to
[149/1000]	something odd had come over him . he was curious what was inside my body , and more curious to know who it was that made me respond this way . how was i supposed to respond to a feeling
[150/1000]	" what do you think the two of you should do ? how am i the best we 'll work on the same story ? the one you have in your mind is the one your parents would have wanted
[151/1000]	so you have seen him once . two weeks ago , and when you first saw him you did n't know anything else about him . this is a hard time for him . you are not a bad person
[152/1000]	" my heart does n't matter when you 're in it . i 'll always remember you around . " she leaned forward and kissed him . he stroked the side of her head . " i 'll
[153/1000]	" i do n't know . " " my brother 's name is jason . he 's eighteen and lives in montana , " she said . " who is jason ? " " my brother ,
[154/1000]	her brows pinched together . " what are you saying ? are you crazy ? " " i need some time ? is that too much to ask ? " " it 's not what i thought you
[155/1000]	her name seemed to come out of his brain like soft thunder . he seemed to sense her anxiety and took her hand before the rain came down again . he carried her directly to his lair , there to
[156/1000]	" yeah , that 's what i said . " " maybe , " she laughed with the sound of her voice . " did he leave you any clue where he was going ? " "
[157/1000]	" when did you know ? " " you can talk ? " he nodded . " it happened before they 'd brought everything up . " " where 's your family ? " they both
[158/1000]	he pulled a small suitcase from the closet and tossed it to me . " the suitcases are yours , so use what you need . i have some clothes , too . " he moved over to the bureau
[159/1000]	" yeah , it 's the thing to watch that the future keeps changing , instead of changing for you . " my mom continued . i was n't sure how to respond it seemed cryptic , " hey
[160/1000]	" no . it 's all right . " he let out a deep sigh . " i just had a great time . " " i wish you could have seen the way she was with you ,
[161/1000]	" wow , that really makes you feel good . " she could n't know the half of it . " it makes me feel good to know that i managed to convince a hot guy to go with
[162/1000]	her words did n't wash over me . what they did , though , was make me feel better . it was , in fact , the most beautiful thing i 'd ever experienced and i knew it .
[163/1000]	the guards had come into the area and looked around , eyeing the guards . " what happened ? " one asked . " they grabbed her . i do n't know why she did it . "
[164/1000]	" never . i am not a young man , and i have not always been . my father was murdered . " " by what ? " " by my mother . " " that 's
[165/1000]	i do . " i had something for you . " if he ever found out - but that was all he could get out at the moment . he was too tired to think much about it . no
[166/1000]	i look around the small , brightly lit gym for what feels like the millionth time . then i stop . in front of my black padded mat is a red , brown , and yellow chec ker board
[167/1000]	" oh , then i guess we 'll just have to do it the old fashioned way then , " he replied , not bothering to wait to tell me where to go . i thought it was probably safe
[168/1000]	the words that emerged from my mouth shocked him . i had said those words to him and more . it was like i 'd said them to my mother after she 'd died . my whole body shuddered .
[169/1000]	he shook his head . " i 'm pretty sure the real reason was n't because i was n't any good . " she was , i realized . " everything else was . " i said it carefully .
[170/1000]	" this is the only way , " a girl 's voice said . they were inside . his mother was in the room and she stared accusingly at him . " i 'm taking out my poison on you
[171/1000]	" i am trying to talk to my husband . " " my husband , " i said indignantly . " what the hell do you want , helen ? we have n't seen you for several days
[172/1000]	three the third night , after a night of not saying a word , gabriel drove sarah home on a monday morning . they went at it for hours , talking about what they would do if they were
[173/1000]	" i think we are back to that , " the soldier said . " let 's find k ant and the others . " they followed the soldier into the forest . they had been here before a
[174/1000]	" have they ever used a razor blade ? " " never . " gabriel came over and took her face in his hands . " you have no idea how much it frightened me to see them do
[175/1000]	" i 'm ... kind of ... having a breakdown . i 'm being stalked . " " with cameras ? as in an ex - partner ? and for real ? " " yes . "
[176/1000]	" a good idea , " i said dryly . then i pointed at nick . " that means he 'll be safe until we leave . " jenks 's face was a pained mask , and he spun
[177/1000]	chapter twelve " that 's all you owe me , " zane murmured against her ear as he reached down to un snap her bra . he leaned back and looked into her eyes as his hands slipped around
[178/1000]	" yeah , but my brother - in - law will go out of his mind if , when the time comes , you go to her first and then go right back to her , " he spat back
[179/1000]	he smiled at her . " you two know each other ? " " yes . " " what kind of brother am i ? " they walked to her bedroom and entered . " oh ,
[180/1000]	" the more i think about it , the more crazy that seems . " we walked in silence for a moment while i pondered what to say next . i opened up my folder and we sat down in
[181/1000]	" what happened to you ? " he said , drawing his coat tighter around him . " i thought you were dead . " the feeling of dread was still there . that whatever had possessed julia had
[182/1000]	" it can come out now that all this is over . but before we give up , we need to get to the good parts . " " with your help , of course . who brought supplies
[183/1000]	two hours later mike and mike met up with one of the officers at the police station that was located just a hundred feet away from their car . mike would spend a good part of saturday night doing the
[184/1000]	" no . never . he may believe what he says . " " will he have a chance of doing anything incriminating ? " " i do n't know . he 's been very secretive . "
[185/1000]	" you still call me that , " said a voice , coming out of the trees right behind them , " not her ? " jason stood still , but claire did n't turn to see how much
[186/1000]	the next morning , they met the twins at the gate as were the few survivors of an explosion in a local warehouse . " you got your orders , boy ? " the younger of the two boys
[187/1000]	" that does n't mean anything , " he said . " of course it does . what was it like ? " " it was ... " he began , then snapped his mouth shut . when
[188/1000]	not good . not good . his thumb stopped moving by my lip , but his fingers stopped touching , and then they kept doing it by the time my head twisted slightly to the side .
[189/1000]	" what the hell ? " he said as he stood up . " what do i care if you do n't like to wear it ? " he put his hands down and stepped away from her . he
[190/1000]	" wow , " i say . " not the way i pictured this night . " " no , not the way you expected it to go , " she says . " but most of all ,
[191/1000]	without hesitating nick ran the blade through the bottom of the center of her palm , leaving a long red trench in the center . " she 's here ! " sara dropped her knife and stepped up behind
[192/1000]	i 'd always made them , <EOS> these new bits and pieces were like the secret of the human spirit , that secret of the eternal touch which nobody can really hide if an enemy is
[193/1000]	i was in a daze , stunned by this new facet of my life . i did n't know how to interact with my parents . most of all , i did n't know how to deal with jett ,
[194/1000]	" of course it is , " i said . " because those other women did n't trust this man either . " " i think that 's what makes it so funny . " i pointed a
[195/1000]	no matter . i looked around at the two guys and nodded . " yeah . i think they understand . " " and this could just go away by the time the sun goes down and we
[196/1000]	she went straight inside , went down the hall to the right . she passed the office where she met and left the office , walked to the back of the building . she turned left and walked until she
[197/1000]	" what 's had you so worried ? " " i used to be a nun . " " oh , god , " said paul , sounding shocked . " it 's okay , " said
[198/1000]	" why is it there ? " she asked . " you ca n't be more than fifty years old . have you been traveling ? or have you been here all your life ? " " it is
[199/1000]	" not yet , " i say . " he may not ask , but you 'll still want to look him up , will . " " just to make sure . " " please ,
[200/1000]	they were n't getting out and walking around all by themselves in the dark , and she , too , did n't like the idea of being alone . they 'd been in the woods too long . she did
[201/1000]	" what are you talking about ? " i asked , ignoring a warning from the guy holding the door between us . i just needed to get past him before it hit my senses and knocked me down the
[202/1000]	" i do n't appreciate your attitude . " she spat the words even as his hands slid under her dress . " you have a gift for talking , little liar . you 'll help me find my
[203/1000]	" wow , is that a real thing ? " he sighed . " how about an honest question ? " " are you joking ? i 'm a mess . i do n't know how i can
[204/1000]	" sure thing , " he smiled at ty . they both sat back down , zane pulling his knees up into his chest to bury them there . ty turned the page , his arm flung across them both
[205/1000]	" i wish , " he said softly . " i wish i could spare you the pain sometimes . can i try to come ? " there was a pause , and then i realized he was staring
[206/1000]	only a few minutes or so later the guards come swarming in , dragging two men . when the tall man starts to scream and we hear another screech , the guards just take him away . i look over
[207/1000]	" i 'll kill you ... " " do n't threaten me . i will kill you , " he snarls at me . i step back . " i 'm here to warn you . "
[208/1000]	" he 's the mayor and it 's right here . " peter shows me a small square from behind a screen . it also looks identical to the ones i 've seen just a minute ago , but before
[209/1000]	" he promised you a dance . right before you left for the night . " " i did n't want to dance with him . " how had she remembered that he 'd asked her to go ?
[210/1000]	" i thought i 'd put the steaks up for later , " mom said . i stared at my plate . " you did n't bake for me , " i said . " i found
[211/1000]	i can feel him , every hard inch on my tongue , thrusting into me like a drowning man trying to swim across the ocean . " please , please , " i beg him , needing friction that can
[212/1000]	" oh i 'm not a child anymore . i 'm a grown man now . " " that 's what i heard . " " i do n't care if you believe me or yourself , doc
[213/1000]	" a friend came to stay ; when his back was turned over , he broke into the house with a knife . he grabbed me and cut open my mouth , spitting on my face . i was trying
[214/1000]	" no , " she cried . " this is what happened to me . " " do n't do this , " he said . he gently pushed her back to the bed and stared down at
[215/1000]	he placed the letter on the end table and slid his hands down the rest of the way , resting his elbows on his knees . " i know what it is . " i laughed , but
[216/1000]	* * * * * chapter 33 " a new family " " a new team " " a new leader " * * * * the next two years passed like that
[217/1000]	" i 'll do what i can . " i watched her for a few moments before i stood up , brushed her hair from her face and tucked her gently back under her head . " just hurry
[218/1000]	now , i could n't help but wonder what it might be like to have a father like christian . i knew he was n't bad looking or anything , but he had to have wanted to be one of
[219/1000]	" how was your week ? how was work ? " this is definitely the one thing i should have expected from ethan . it 's almost like a rite of passage for him . " it was
[220/1000]	" um , you 're very persuasive . " she grins , pushing a finger between my shoulder blades . " but you 'd only know what you did before . and there 's a reason you did n't get
[221/1000]	" a friend of mine , " he said , and he spoke in clipped tones with deceptive warmth , not breaking down into any tears . " an inventor . " " a painter ? " she said
[222/1000]	" yes , sir . and i do think we should call it a day now . i have a number for one from the british police and i am going to be in touch if we remember anything else
[223/1000]	after ten minutes , when the waitress called back and the other woman turned away , i turned my attention to him . " what are you going to do about it ? " i kept watching him ,
[224/1000]	" a man 's got a key ! " " a key ? " " yeah , the one you tried to steal . " " i went to your apartment ? " " yep !
[225/1000]	" are you going to bring the rest of your things along ? " " not yet . they 're still packed , " said elaine . " what are you going to do tomorrow night ? "
[226/1000]	i pulled in a deep breath and nodded . " excellent , miss lane . " ms. terwilliger wrote something on the clipboard and handed it to me . she turned to adrian . " tell the boy you
[227/1000]	" you 're a slut and a liar and i 'm not . " " you broke my heart . " " i 'm good at lying . " " i do n't know where you get
[228/1000]	" right behind you . " i glance back over my shoulder just in time to see dad run into the bar . " it 's her ! " i yell , jumping out of the booth . " you
[229/1000]	" why ? " she asked . " what did you do next ? how did you get the bullet out of him ? " " well , by the time you woke up , but i wish i
[230/1000]	before she can blink , i scoop her up in my arms and kiss her like she 's the first person in the world , which , of course , i am . seconds later , her mouth is
[231/1000]	" i felt so weird today . like one minute i was normal , and the next i did n't want to go home at all . " " i guess that makes sense , " he said ,
[232/1000]	when she finally caught her breath once more , she said , " my mom died before she could tell me the truth . " " i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry . " " please
[233/1000]	in the end , he took a left and headed south . eventually , he came to a gravel road that would eventually lead him to the main road that led to his cottage . he stopped to rest ,
[234/1000]	" i know at the moment . i 'm sure his feelings are hurt as hell , but thanks for asking ... " " i 'd trust you with my life , if you even wanted to ask .
[235/1000]	' what ? ' said nanny ogg indignantly . ' what d'you think ? ' ' i mean , your arm , she wants to take a tumble from it . ' ' get inside , ' said
[236/1000]	" i do n't know , " nate said . " someone ought to do more damage . " " we got the message , " nate said . " i 'll send the word . " "
[237/1000]	now what ? " okay . what are you going to do ? " he thought for a moment . " i really need to call hank . maybe in a couple of hours or a few days
[238/1000]	" no , we 're not . " it was said with what he was thinking . " she sure took a shine to you all the time . " " yeah , we get it from her
[239/1000]	" and we 're still not sure about the cause ? " " no , the medical examiner 's report was for an unknown person in an interrogation room . but i think that 's unlikely ... unless ...
[240/1000]	the general grinned . " are you saying i 'm not good enough for you ? i 'm a good little lad , or better than best for you , from the sound of it . " after a
[241/1000]	" god i hate to ask this , but did you hear what my wife just said ? i just woke up and i 'm afraid one of you two better start talking . " " there might be
[242/1000]	" i 'm sorry , " i say as my hand reaches out and grabs his . we gaze into each other 's eyes , and i get a strange feeling when i do this . it 's real .
[243/1000]	" what are you afraid of ? " i asked . her grip on the gun tightened slightly , but she did n't pull it from me . " i 'll never kill you . you 'll never see
[244/1000]	" but you 're the guy who 's been giving me all kinds of trouble . " " you were the one who said you did n't want a relationship . " " i also said i did
[245/1000]	" hello , what 's up ? " i yelled into the phone . " you have to come with me . " he sounded like he was pulling his car together . " it 's not safe .
[246/1000]	" i do n't see or hear her on the line . " jake could n't contain himself . " her brother , michael , told me . the girl said the police were searching for the girls .
[247/1000]	the voice interrupted my thoughts , " well , it 's not the first time you have helped me , what 's new ? " in the room next to mine , the sun has finally risen .
[248/1000]	but she was n't afraid of cole and her memories . she wanted to feel that close to him . that solid , strong , love - filled connection . " erin ... " he brushed back her hair
[249/1000]	" you were standing right there . you 're a big girl , you can take it , " katie said . " i 'm too tired to play this game . " " yeah ? then take
[250/1000]	" go home , " she said , firmly . he got out of the car , still silent , and followed her to the door . " you 'll be home tomorrow , " he murmured .
[251/1000]	the first week was chaotic . i made it to work and had a long day after that . my car was being tested ( and the car , that is , my little mercedes that i drove for $
[252/1000]	" hey ! " claire turned around . " what are you doing ? " " nothing . just , this place is so weird . like even the bathrooms . " " i thought they were
[253/1000]	but they could n't figure out what exactly they could do about it . so they simply buried the treasure . and the rest , to be perfectly blunt , was forgotten in its wake . chapter
[254/1000]	" i will miss our tea , and you are always welcome . " then she saw no reason to say any more about the situation . as mrs. lo on twill was the only lady of the ton to
[255/1000]	and this is what would make a grand host . she might have asked herself this question several times to bring him into the conversation . she imagined him as a good man , gentle , loving , kind .
[256/1000]	so here goes : " the way i see it , it might be easier for you to just give up the girl . you probably know how it works . but you 'll go to war again .
[257/1000]	" i did n't do it . " she said firmly . he looked at her in sympathy . " i do n't know what you think you did . but i 'll tell you what happened next .
[258/1000]	she gasped , shocked when he stopped , but his hand cupped her cheek tenderly . " do n't be nervous . " " i 'm not nervous . " he cupped her nape in his hand and tenderly
[259/1000]	" no , he was just doing that to take my mind off how hard it was to keep my mouth shut . " he stepped closer . " besides , i do n't mind . this was my favorite
[260/1000]	" you really are not enjoying this , are you ? " " nothing in the world is more satisfying to me than you ... " " tell me about it ... " he said , but he
[261/1000]	it 's like being a ghost in the crowd . i would n't want to be one . i would n't want to disappear . i have a name for this place - the people i want - the people
[262/1000]	still on the phone , he checked his pants pocket , and saw it was still there . he looked around and saw no - one on the street . he pulled that out and held it close to his
[263/1000]	" i would n't have , " said peter . he said about her , in a confidential voice , but she heard it , and did n't seem interested . they watched the three vampires in silence , and
[264/1000]	" not to mention your cousin , and your husband is a bastard , too . you want us to sell all this stuff ? where 'd you get it ? " " i do n't think my real
[265/1000]	' i 'm ... okay , ' i mumble when i see her searching for a place to put the kettle on . ' my mom made some homemade waffles for me today . the first one i 've eaten
[266/1000]	" she 'll love everything , " i said . i knew as soon as i walked into the house that abby was n't there . but there she was . her golden hair standing up wildly against the
[267/1000]	' hey , he 's just like you ! look at all that hair ! ' she 's looking at his hair , i know i have to do something , but i ca n't see what to do
[268/1000]	" they all seem to see the same thing , " said richard . " i 've been through it with them . they <EOS> ... how do you put it ... they have a big part of me now
[269/1000]	because the only reason i would go for it was because her " sister " was like a sister to me . i leaned back against the side of the building next to aly 's building . the night
[270/1000]	" but i 'll take it , " he said . " so the boss said , ' why do n't you go get a new partner now to help you sort this out ? i 'll give your boyfriend
[271/1000]	the room finally ended . the room was pitch black , which was even more unnerving than the bright and unnerving darkness that surrounded them . " is everyone all right ? " came the soft , musical voice
[272/1000]	" i 'm sorry , sir ? " asked the police officer . " just let me know it 's raining , " replied the angry chief . " if you 're trying to send me home ,
[273/1000]	" i 'm having some trouble sleeping and have said something stupid and she said the same thing in the first place , " he answered , before catching himself , then explaining that it was best to tell her
[274/1000]	" very well , " said zeus and began to speak again . " i do n't know how many days and nights until new year 's day . will we be returning ? do others know where we are
[275/1000]	that 's the name of the town of ber n wick , which is on the coast of north carolina . <EOS> this area , and home with several cars . the same house , the farm , and
[276/1000]	she felt a sudden sting of tears fill her eyes as she said , " i 'm sorry i let myself down . i 'm not used to hurting , let alone trusting people . " " but you
[277/1000]	the prince 's lip curled into a snarl , and his eyes began to turn coal black . " because they are not what they seem . and because i want to know why , and all others , they
[278/1000]	" me too . " " so now it 's more like i 'm your bodyguard . " she could n't wait to wake up and think up scenarios of two of them , wrapped in each other 's
[279/1000]	" do ye mean , as in it bein ' the only two men in the whole f * * kin ' room that were not off ru shin ' him yesterday ? " " what ? no .
[280/1000]	" and in doing so we might try to force him to put on a little more weight . " " we ? " " yes , sir . you were n't sure about it . you did
[281/1000]	the next eight weeks seemed to drag like hours . it seemed that i was standing on the beach , looking at the water , looking at the rocks . i could feel the pressure in my ankles increase and
[282/1000]	her eyes dropped to the photo of her and liam together . i wanted to be the one to take that , she was mine and i was hers . " hey , guys . what 's up ? "
[283/1000]	he did n't answer . she glanced around . there was no one else in the lobby . the street was clear . she looked back at dylan . now he 'd crossed on this side of the
[284/1000]	" how well have you ever been able to read ? " " we can get things to eat . " " i love pickles ! " " not in my entire life , " he said
[285/1000]	she cleared her throat . " i do n't really appreciate a man who 's using me to get to information and then forcing himself on me because of it . " " you have to realize i 've
[286/1000]	" oh , my gosh . " i almost groaned . " he 's hot . " " i 'd see you again while we 're driving . " " later . " i groaned again and i
[287/1000]	" yeah . " " you must 've been out there for far too long . " i 'd been awake half the night before so it was surprising when i did n't get caught on my bad side
[288/1000]	" well , okay then . " her fingers tightened around my wrists , as though she could n't sit still any longer , but she forced herself to let go and turned to the side , leaning against my
[289/1000]	the crowd shifted like a restless mob , searching desperately for the source of the noise . for an instant i could do nothing but watch the scene play out in slow motion . then the room began to
[290/1000]	i shook my head and smiled . " did you see the guy 's face ? " she laughed . " no ... i do n't remember now , but he must have worked with him . "
[291/1000]	" what ? do n't you think you can cut me loose now ? " he asked , as she closed the door and started down the hallway . " i could , but after listening to your story
[292/1000]	that 's where i 'm heading , " said james , clearly confused . " we do n't know that she 's here , " said joseph . before anyone could respond , i glanced into the living
[293/1000]	" i know now , i know , " he said and smiled a warm smile . he knew how much she wanted to let go . he sensed that something different was happening , something very different . he
[294/1000]	" what the hell kind of game are you playing ? " " we 're playing a game <EOS> , you idiot . we are playing an experiment . " he said with a smirk on his face .
[295/1000]	i smiled . " yeah . " she stopped moving and pulled her hands off my cheeks . " what do you mean you wo n't like the color ? black and white ? " she tilted her head
[296/1000]	" they 're all very impressive but i still do n't understand . " " you 're a master , " jason began cautiously , " you can be very quiet while you 're working and you have a
[297/1000]	she stepped out of the tunnel and into the tunnel which ran in front of her . no one would ever feel it . no one ever would be able to find it . they would know who ran it
[298/1000]	' my fault , if i allow myself to be killed you can just leave me and i 'll go to another location just like you and i , do what 's necessary to catch them . ' i nodded
[299/1000]	" but ? " jason prompted , not allowing himself to be distracted . " i 'll not have one of them here ! " " i intend to treat the boys personally , " the viscount announced ,
[300/1000]	" i 'm so surprised . " she stared at me , with a smile that was completely not her . " why ? " " i 'm not sure how much to talk here . "
[301/1000]	if she held on to his hand at all times , would he ever let her go ? " i wo n't let him go , " she said fiercely , but she was already slipping back into the
[302/1000]	i grabbed the back of her dress , and hauled her against me . " i need you right now , angel . " chapter 3 jax i had n't shaved in a week . the
[303/1000]	" no , i do n't , " i said . " or ... i mean , it does n't really matter , does it ? it 's my name ...... " she waved a hand , as if
[304/1000]	" yes , i was there for a while . " he ran his free hand through his hair , his eyes never leaving hers . " not long after your mother died , they were planning to open a
[305/1000]	" they sure get to travel very fast , " he said softly , gazing lovingly at their new new son 's face . " yeah , " taylor agreed , taking a step backwards to allow the growing
[306/1000]	" i have . " she was n't sure . did she have something stuck in her throat or was she the only one stupid enough to believe that this was actually happening ? " what happened ? "
[307/1000]	" how 'd you know i 'd be here ? " david asked . when he tried to take the car keys , david blocked his entry . " you know how rare it is for an eighteen - year
[308/1000]	" yes ma'am . is it time ? " his eyes were shiny . he 'd been on this roller coaster three days in a row . he 'd stopped paying attention during his second day and now found himself
[309/1000]	the man looked around at the other houses . " ok , you guys get out here . " he pulled out an umbrella . " well , what do we do with this ? " " take
[310/1000]	" sure , when she met us first thing this morning . he said it was part of the job description . that really sounded like a reference to the men of my life that they are . " if
[311/1000]	his words were weak as he repeated them back to her . but she held his stare , staring through his pain . " i 'm here . " a sigh lifted his shoulders . " thank god
[312/1000]	" all right , " he said , " now that that 's settled , what next ? " " first , i 'd like to take a short trip to the lake and look at her again ,
[313/1000]	" let 's go , " said my mom . " be ready to go when we get there . " " are we going to see daddy ? " asked dana , looking worried . " no
[314/1000]	" me ? " i said . " you , " he replied . " your spirit , in truth , has faded . you do n't want to be here . " " i 'm not sure
[315/1000]	" i was going to ask you the same question . so if nothing else , i suppose we have to wait until we get these kids home and it only has a few minutes ' til sunset . so
[316/1000]	" how long has this been going on ? " asked richard . after a moment she replied . " two years . " " since that time , " said richard . richard shook his head .
[317/1000]	" and you can <EOS> and <EOS> her , " i took her favorites . when on the computer , i found the last to eat . " why 's we all do some stuff . " i
[318/1000]	" it is . " " then what are you doing here ? " he did n't answer right away . " i have been up all night . i think maybe i have made myself ready to
[319/1000]	" no . even if it did n't , that does n't make it okay . it 's not right . it 's not right for both of us . " " hey . " she wraps her hand
[320/1000]	' you 'd better not lose your damn head there , ' said the captain . ' i mean it , a ship ca n't risk going down . i 'd reckon ' twas lost and this is how we
[321/1000]	" one thing , the name was in red <EOS> too . when we started out in middle school . he took out my underwear , but i never was able to move that far . " " well
[322/1000]	i could feel his grip loosen on my hand . " you okay ? " i nodded . " just take me home , please . i need to be alone right now . " not a line
[323/1000]	" oh , it 's going to be a long day , " she says , her eyes on the glass as her voice quivers . " just hold tight to the handle , " i say . a
[324/1000]	he did n't like her thinking like that ... no matter how much she wished he did . not even the cold , hard fact of him holding her - a fact she knew he would never admit to
[325/1000]	there was nothing she could do but fight the temptation to escape . would n't they have done the same thing even if the council had n't intervened ? a groan sounded , and a hand grasped hold of
[326/1000]	' yes . ' ' what are you talking about ? ' ' a test . ' ' oh . ' ' i am a doctor , doctor . i teach medical classes . they are
[327/1000]	at first , she thinks maybe he 's just sick , but as he lifts his head , he looks her up and down like he 's been checking her over again for signs that he may 've started to
[328/1000]	" then that means it does n't matter if i 'm an old man , how much it bothers you , how much it worries me , how much it burns . what you go through , what others want
[329/1000]	he smiles . damn him , so sweet and good . my heart breaks for him , and he 's my friend . so i decide he should probably get to know my feelings . he opens a
[330/1000]	" you 're not funny . " " yes , " gabriel said with no emotion . " but why should i be ? " " because you have this twisted , deranged , sick feeling in your
[331/1000]	" i think i can get to the second floor , " said henry . " which building ? " asked the nurse . " only the first floor and stairs . " " sounds like a
[332/1000]	" i asked him to leave . " no answer . she gave a bitter laugh and opened her bedroom door . " your son is a mess . you 're lucky he did that . you know
[333/1000]	" my wife 's been missing a few days , " mary snapped . " i knew it was after sundown by then . everything has gone quiet . " nick knew better . mary always kept everything secret
[334/1000]	" yeah , well , i had to get out of the bar . i did n't feel like showing my face for a while . " she sighed . " i do love you , though , you know
[335/1000]	" and he does n't like it , so let 's get off this train . " they got off again , and the driver tried to hail a cab but this time they did n't wait . the
[336/1000]	" okay , " said her father , " but let 's ask her some questions first . " " okay , " said jane , " i will . ask her anything . anything at all . "
[337/1000]	" it 's not the same as before . " " yes , it is , " he growled as he began to move his hips . his hips thrust harder against the spot at the apex .
[338/1000]	" the fire department will help the man . he 's <EOS> the closest of his neighbors to us , he can help them . " " he is the closest of his cousins as far as i am
[339/1000]	but this is n't the only one who was watching . on the other side of the screen , sam is reading , " look at the two lines of a text , and then the text gets blurred .
[340/1000]	i 've known him too long , i think . but this is ... it 's the first time this has ever happened to me . the car jolts forward . i cry out . " colin !
[341/1000]	his gaze locked with mine , and i smiled faintly . " he ca n't control himself . i can . " i shrugged , feeling more confident now that i spoke of my emotions . " so
[342/1000]	" will he still have a few more months ? " she asked . " oh yeah , " i said , " but it did n't last long . " in fact before , when seth and i
[343/1000]	they reached the bottom of the stairs and headed into the kitchen . " yes ? " " i do n't want us to go looking for her . we almost got lost that time around . "
[344/1000]	" no , it 's better for those poor souls , for me , for us . " i nod slowly . " i know what you mean . " " you should . you remind me of
[345/1000]	" yeah , sounds perfect . " the words just slipped out , and his face softened . " i 'll make some more sandwiches for you . " and i did n't even think that 's how he
[346/1000]	the man laughed . " you 're a crazy girl . " " i do n't care . let 's find out what 's holding him back . " they pushed their way through the front door of
[347/1000]	" he means he has some other issues to work out , " she blurted out . " it 's complicated and you do n't need any explanations . but he 's also busy . it 's just a minor
[348/1000]	" no . i want it . " he studied her face a moment , his eyes hooded . " will you come back to your room ? " " yes ... " he cupped his hands around
[349/1000]	" i 'm sure i could make up something else to persuade you you 're interested in coming over anyway . " well , duh . <EOS> which she assumed was a mistake . " if i promise to
[350/1000]	" oh , that makes so much more sense , " mr. white said bitterly . " you 're right , " charlie said . " you know , you 've given me quite a lot to think about
[351/1000]	" the same thing . " " you do n't think that a man would go behind your back and kiss you ? " she licked her lower lip . " i doubt it . the man knows
[352/1000]	i 'm guessing he was still feeling something for her , even if he did n't want to admit it . i 'm learning how to let go of it when i see it . it 's like it 's
[353/1000]	" what kind of music are you guys playing ? i was listening to mine in my kitchen and i was n't so sure that it sounded right . " " i 've always wanted to be a dj
[354/1000]	" that does n't mean anything . " i told him , but he looked at me as if i were a loon . " it 's just that by not trusting me , you 're admitting to feeling
[355/1000]	she was n't lying ; she actually felt uneasy and vulnerable here . and she could n't remember ever being really safe before . she did n't know who killed her father . but now , however she 'd
[356/1000]	" take a quick shower in the next room . i 'll be gone until noon . " he 's not saying it 's coming sooner . i follow him out the door with his key card and
[357/1000]	" that 's good to hear , " i say and immediately feel better because i wo n't feel good if i do n't see quinton again . when he 's all better , all things will be good .
[358/1000]	" yes , of course , " he said . then he said , " no , thank you . " he looked up just as the bartender approached . " jim , please , do n't forget the
[359/1000]	" yeah , i 'll see you at the ball , man , " sam said . as a last resort , jack called his secretary and told her they were meeting in the office . he 'd heard
[360/1000]	" what are you doing ? " " i 'm going back for the book , " it said . " have n't you got something to write ? " " i do , but not for the
[361/1000]	' did sam call me ? ' asked virginia ! the line was dead ! she looked at her watch , it was nearly nine o'clock . in fear she looked at the display in the office phone box and
[362/1000]	" can you leave now ? " he pulled her forward . " i 'd like to see you , but let me call my dog first . then i think his dinner will be okay . "
[363/1000]	please give me information on the other half 's people . all my friends . my family . what am i going to do ? the news is n't all good . something has made a commotion in that
[364/1000]	" you 're like - " he chuckled . " more like a shrew . we do things the wrong way with each other , we talk about it and then we keep it under wraps with an occasional
[365/1000]	" i 'm pretty sure we 're not getting married . " i knew in my gut , i knew what i wanted , and it was n't a girl . i was an idiot . i 'd just gotten
[366/1000]	" then why did you set off the bomb at the station ? " he asks . he 's really getting pissed off , but i have to smile in spite of myself . if i ca n't get
[367/1000]	" i 'm sorry ' is the word to describe them , " he said , the corner of his mouth quir king . " well well , at least that 's what we call 'em now . " then
[368/1000]	" go and finish your homework just like you did last week . " that snapped her out of something of a daze . she glanced up , but all she could see were a pair of black slacks
[369/1000]	i told her the next night it had been a long four weeks , and i 'd made some progress but the pregnancy was moving fast , and it was unlikely either of us could carry on with the baby
[370/1000]	" you . he 's like my baby , " she said . " and you 've no idea how much i love that , " i told her . " oh , please , " she said
[371/1000]	" i 'm so happy you could stay . this is so much better than the motel i stayed in a few years ago . " she let herself into the house and let herself slip against him , grateful
[372/1000]	he turned with a jerk on the bar . when he saw her , he stood and took a step closer . when she flinched , he felt the punch of the door . " what the hell have you
[373/1000]	that 's bullshit ! i did not read any of that gossip blog from the start . i was always in contact with them through email . i just never got the chance to do so . i do n't
[374/1000]	" is it about the car ? " " let 's go get one . " " i 'm with you . i really do n't like walking at night . " she yawned . " i could
[375/1000]	" see , i was n't surprised . " she laughed , and i felt a little embarrassed . maybe it was her appearance . maybe i should n't have called her . " i 'm sorry . "
[376/1000]	" and so you will do , my friend , " said the woman in her strange voice , as she removed her mask . her small brown eyes gazed off , lost in old memories . " but first
[377/1000]	at the bottom of the page , the author read the title of the book . " this is a good book ! " exclaimed the librarian . " so are you , " said the author , and
[378/1000]	" let me , " he asked . " what do you need ? " " a place to get some water and some food , " john said . he grabbed two bottles of water , then tossed
[379/1000]	the sky darkened while they slept last night and their surroundings had changed . it was so quiet that i could hear a distant rumble . we had spent some time sleeping for the first time that month and everything
[380/1000]	the sun was almost behind his shoulder when he left the city in his truck , hoping that his eyes would be fresh and sharp once again in the morning . he had been to the hotel several times
[381/1000]	" yes , i remember , " he answered , hoping his voice did n't sound like . they sat in silence for a moment , and then both of them said goodbye and disconnected . chapter nine
[382/1000]	" i know you are . you are a very precious and admirable woman and would do nothing to harm you by being your friend , my dear . but i would rather give you a chance to make up
[383/1000]	the guard with the gun moved into the shadows , with his back to the door . " can i get up now ? " " sure - if you want to . " he drew the
[384/1000]	the old man was still standing on the other side . at one point he stood up , his hands in the air , but as he did the red light came on on . " where in the
[385/1000]	" because ... because you would have to watch me . " she was n't really kidding . " what ? " his eyes were widening again . " you know what . " this time she
[386/1000]	i think he 's thinking about the night he lost someone the best , the night that had ended in tragedy and misery . " what are you going to do with that if you come back every year
[387/1000]	" are you saying that i am a cheater ? yes ! yes ! i know that i lied . " i said standing up and running my hands through my hair . " i 'm really here on that
[388/1000]	" that 's what i thought you would say . i brought you flowers and chocolates and my favorite present . i started by asking you to come over for dinner the other night to apologize for my behaviour ,
[389/1000]	" you did n't answer the question . " " of course i did n't . " she picked up the phone again and punched in sean 's number . " are you done with that thing ?
[390/1000]	" well how did you find out ? " he asked . david looked to the rear wall of the room . and he saw the shape of a man moving across the room , towards the light ,
[391/1000]	i 'd not been the mother of his child . my eyes filled with tears as he brought my hand to his lips , kissed the back of it and then he was grinning at me . "
[392/1000]	" sorry , <EOS> , um , um , that 's the truth now . i ca n't go out in public with you . i 'm going to marry him now . " she looked at her watch .
[393/1000]	which had been getting progressively worse . not knowing anything else , he picked up where he hit the floor . as his body drifted into a kind of stupor , he groaned , " okay ... okay
[394/1000]	" of course i 'll let you go . " he let go of the iron bar that kept his back to the road and turned toward her . " it 's early , " he said . "
[395/1000]	" it 's a wonder your father allowed it , is n't it ? because he 's been to one hell of a good school in the past ten years . " so this was her dad . her
[396/1000]	" it 's hard to say , " i told him honestly . " after all this time i 'm getting good at understanding people , but i still do n't understand what 's going on . " "
[397/1000]	she could think of nothing better . " oh , yeah ? " " she 's not really interested in me at all . if you were my daughter , that would be a problem . " "
[398/1000]	" he really is so charming . " " he is ? if i was a very good dog ... or if i were a very bad pet , i would be doing my best to be more docile
[399/1000]	" i am . i 'm trying to be , well ... open - minded about - " i looked at him and swallowed thickly . i could see the corner of his mouth lift . " about sharing information
[400/1000]	" i ca n't believe how fast we were travelling . " jack said . " no way , i would n't have tried . " faye said . she frowned . " what 's wrong with you guys
[401/1000]	" really . it was a very , very small thing . " thomas leaned toward her and began to lightly shove her around so she faced the wall . " it was just the right size ,
[402/1000]	" actually , " steve said , leaning a little closer to us , " nothing like the ' i 'm really confused right now as to why i <EOS> ... " he paused and looked between his wife and
[403/1000]	" mr. ma ssey sent me , and i 'll help as much as i can , " johnny said , as he pulled out the files from under his arm and handed them to the doctor . "
[404/1000]	" um , no , you should 've called or something . i just hate what you left out and how that came out . " " i 'm fine , " i insisted . " you just
[405/1000]	" we should leave - now . " to my surprise , she nodded . " i have a better idea . we should stay close to where the car was last night . " " how about
[406/1000]	" i want you to come over here with me tomorrow night , " he begged . " i wo n't . " " get it out of your system , " he laughed . " sorry
[407/1000]	" i 'm fine , dad . " she takes a breath , and the trembling of her teeth adds to the worry . " your mother 's right , honey . are you all right ? "
[408/1000]	" and he says i did n't do it , " she said , her voice just as low . " you didn't do it either , " he told her . " you 're an angel . you
[409/1000]	" actually , yes . for how long ? " " ever since the end of the third year . " " why did he go to such lengths ? " " my mind is still fuzzy
[410/1000]	" thanks , " said chris . " let 's get out of here . " " come on , " chris said . " there 's another way out of here . " they left the hospital
[411/1000]	" is n't the best way to find out if it really is him ? " that was a question she did n't want to think about . in fact , if she did n't know any better ,
[412/1000]	i was lying on my bed , my head cradled in my hands as i waited for the tears to stop falling . i was n't sure where i was anymore . somewhere off to the side of the house
[413/1000]	" will you listen to everything i have to say , please ? we got news about a dead man . " i shook the papers gently , not wanting to disturb the pages i placed there .
[414/1000]	i smiled meekly . " i have already given you my word on it , so there 's no harm in my vow to it . " he shook his head . my smile died on my face ,
[415/1000]	2 . there are some things about people i could never understand that <EOS> - just like that ... well , they were so very interesting . 2 would be nice . 2 could n't wait for once
[416/1000]	the vampire 's voice was a faint , angry whisper , and i froze , my head going up and behind me as my ears stung with cold . they were out there ... and i had the distinct impression
[417/1000]	" no , my cousin is not here . i promised a friendly friendship . " " i thought perhaps that since she has n't heard from you in twelve years that maybe you have sent a message back
[418/1000]	" it took you three days to get back . " dr. jenkins 's voice , in the next room , seemed impossibly far away . " i will not be able to check you for cancer anytime soon .
[419/1000]	his feet nearly tripped on the edge of the bed , he nearly tripped over a set of books on one of the sofas a few feet in front of them . he 'd been unable to bring himself to
[420/1000]	" you must be worried , " he said . " but we 've found the perfect pair . " " what makes you think that ? " he beamed . " believe me , it 's part
[421/1000]	" it 's a good idea , " sarah agreed . " you know any good restaurant where they serve french fries with extra - fat salt and double cream frosting ? remember when i talked about the french fries
[422/1000]	" no . i really did n't . " i frowned . she was talking nonsense . that did n't seem like robin . " mom ? " " what , baby ? " " i
[423/1000]	" i 'll meet you in the hall in five minutes alone , " he said . he quickly shut the door and walked down to the dining room . he heard a strange sound coming from the dining area
[424/1000]	i do n't know what will happen . i 'm thinking about sex of all things . about this very moment , i do n't know what i 'm thinking . this very breath of air is as
[425/1000]	it was then i realize two very important things . one , our friend , did n't take me for a friend . two , he did n't just kill derek . two , he 'd done it for me
[426/1000]	" are you okay ? " he turned and looked back at her , his eyes rimmed in red and bleary and his lips puffy . " i 'm fine . " " you 're not . "
[427/1000]	" why are you wearing that ? " " i used to wear my blue pants . not anymore . " " what does that mean ? " " it means that the blue pants have stopped
[428/1000]	' no . i know it 's hard to speak of but i 'm happy that your son may be able to have a strong , healthy family again . ' ' perhaps this will have to be the
[429/1000]	' why do n't you just leave him alone ? ' she said when he did n't respond . ' he 's doing so well here . ' ' you do n't have to say anything . at least
[430/1000]	with their heads inside , the sound of voices carried on the wind . what a peaceful place this was , a place to rest and forget and to wait and only be with one another . it was the
[431/1000]	" this is kind of ... ridiculous , is n't it ? " " i guess so . " i shrugged but there was no room for doubt . she looked at me and i could see that
[432/1000]	' that was an accident - not a mistake . i 'm just thinking clearly from now on , and i do n't want another tragedy to happen . got it ? ' she nodded . ' you
[433/1000]	the second reason that our search begins was because of our father . " when ethan and i heard this , we each shut up and stared at each other from under lowered brows . " he killed her
[434/1000]	and no , she would n't . he could n't promise to keep her and now she wished she had never left him . even if she had n't , he could n't break away from this marriage .
[435/1000]	i have n't done anything . " " and that is the only reason , is it not ? " " i do n't understand . you wanted to ask me this , the day after my brother
[436/1000]	" i doubt he 'll like that . " she stared across the room at the family portrait of alex , standing with his arms wide open when he 'd first won the national championship . he 'd posed for
[437/1000]	" not quite , sweetheart , " ryan whispered . " another time . " it was pure heaven , almost a miracle , when the doctor pronounced him fit to be home and ryan knew that ryan would
[438/1000]	" i hope you 're right . " chapter three she was standing in the middle of his living room , staring down at the painting . she knew she was staring at the portrait - why was
[439/1000]	why she should be excited about him being at the farm , she just could n't figure out . and what possessed him to go from letting them work together or even flirting with her , to lying to her
[440/1000]	" look , it 's obvious that you 're a terrible liar , ' says michael , moving towards michael and his arm , " but you do n't know what you 're talking about . " at this
[441/1000]	" how dare you ! " i growl before i start pushing through the crowd . a familiar face stands in my way . " whoa there , big lady , " michael says as he stumbles his way
[442/1000]	" do n't go too far . i 'm going to be in the room . " i got out and started a couple of turns for his room . " if you ever do that again , you
[443/1000]	" you wanted to prove to me that an enemy was n't an immediate threat . " " that 's different . you could n't bring yourself to kill us the first chance you got . that could take
[444/1000]	" yes , " said the general , carefully putting his finger to his lips . he glanced from one to the other . " go ahead , my men are in the mood for a bit of a skirmish
[445/1000]	" this boy wo n't be getting any more . " " but ... i 'll only be here for a few hours , " i said . " do you want me to check with the sheriff
[446/1000]	" never mind , " she said . " i hate parties anyway . just keep me posted if i end up dying . let the government save in case that happens . " she yawned and a huge smile
[447/1000]	" but i remember you - " " that 's over , jim , " she interrupted again . " we 're done . " " we are ? " " in the flesh . "
[448/1000]	the thought of the entire world of this world being on the attack set his jaw . chapter nineteen if there were a god , you really would think there was a second me . an only me
[449/1000]	you 're mine now . " do n't fight it , " he said softly , and then he was touching her . sliding his hands down her sides , and then down between her thighs . she shuddered
[450/1000]	" who are you ? " i said . " it 's you who should know who i am , " said the girl , who i 'm guessing was named morrigan . " you work for morrigan
[451/1000]	' would you prefer me to do the talking ? i 'm sure i can make it easier . ' ' as you wish , ' i responded . ' i was thinking of the other day when you
[452/1000]	" not exactly , " he replied . i raised an eyebrow . he was n't talking about his old life . " the thing i do n't like is leaving you behind . i do n't think
[453/1000]	" what are you talking about , dad ? " " there was this old guy who lived a couple of streets down from me . he 's having a heart attack on the corner . " "
[454/1000]	" no , i did not . the queen wants me to hold the reins , not command , " said grey wind . " all is not as it seems . " " may we leave ? "
[455/1000]	he turned to face her . " you look wonderful . " " thank you , " she said , not sure what else to say . the words did n't come . his eyes were closed and
[456/1000]	" you want to help , i 'll provide some food and water . get something to drink . we 're in a hurry to get going as soon as possible , " i said as i saw the relief
[457/1000]	it took a few minutes for them to reach their assigned location . the guards were stationed with their units inside the gate , as well as a platoon of guards guarding the gateway to the main compound . to
[458/1000]	" is that all ? " she asked . " well , there 's one thing more you should know , " i said . " and what would that be , dear ? " she asked sweetly
[459/1000]	" i 'm doing this as i have to do it , " he agreed firmly . " you do n't have to do anything . it 's been a pretty successful operation already , " she murmured ,
[460/1000]	the thought of it made colin wonder which one was the better part of two . " good . " she smiled . " to put it simply , i hate admitting my feelings to myself , but if
[461/1000]	she nodded and said , " thanks again for the tea . sorry about the mess . " he said , " i trust your mother could n't see anything or hear anything . " " no ,
[462/1000]	the words hit me and i was n't sure i 'd wanted them to come out . i hated <EOS> really . most of all , the fact that i could hear . that was n't something i wanted to
[463/1000]	he 's too tall , too strong for me to grab ; i 'd drop him like a bag of rocks if i tried . i do n't want to shake him , but i need to find a way
[464/1000]	it was only later that she realized she was running for her life . her feet thudded on the pavement as she hurried to the door . behind her , she could hear her pursuer 's footfalls fading into the
[465/1000]	" i swear i do , " she told him , holding his gaze . " now please return to my brother . please . " for once unable to take his eyes off her , she whispered , "
[466/1000]	" that 's good . " she nodded and tried to keep her features neutral . " that makes sense , " she repeated too earnestly . what was going on with him ? her heart thumped loudly in her
[467/1000]	it should have been one of her least favorite conversations . " so , that 's what you 're working on . i see . " she took a breath and crossed her arms . " yeah , we
[468/1000]	so she 'd gone ahead and blown it with nate . " yeah , i think so too , " she agreed , leaning against the door frame looking down at him , trying not to look at his
[469/1000]	i nodded . " the only way this is gon na be resolved is with a real woman who could help . " i gaped at him . " you 're breaking up with me . " "
[470/1000]	" well , my sister 's the boss . she 'll let me stay , but she 'll make sure i did n't put any people in danger . from what i can tell , she 's quite nice .
[471/1000]	both women stopped and looked him up and down . the sun caught the highlights in her hair . " you look beautiful , " tara said . her eyes glittered . the girl 's gaze never left
[472/1000]	" you must have called me ? " his eyes moved to mine . " have you called me ? yes . you must have called me . " i looked down at my feet . his
[473/1000]	he stepped from the woods and onto the gravel drive . they were seated on a patch of dry asphalt , with a porch swing creaking slightly . three days had passed . already he was thinking about the fact
[474/1000]	" i 've come for my money . " " give it to me . " " you know , this is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever done . you always say things with a laugh
[475/1000]	" because who wants to be stuck like that ? you ? ' god , i love you ' ? " " no , hell no , " he laughs . " i love working at a bank .
[476/1000]	" what ? " " you ca n't hear me . i 'm not talking to you . " " you 're not ? " " please . " " okay . " his hand settled
[477/1000]	there was her husband , and he looked wonderful and wonderful and just the right size for so it could have been the whole company . not some little piece of gold you picked when everything was screwed up and
[478/1000]	" thanks , " beth snapped . " you 're being a bitch . " " not really , " was all beth managed to say . we walked down the street for a while , as beth
[479/1000]	' you really did n't trust us , ' said harry . ' you did n't know about the danger . your life might 've changed completely , harry . with this plan you wo n't have to worry about
[480/1000]	" this time ? " he asked like he really did n't believe it was possible to do it . " what ? " " be one with me ? " it took a moment for her
[481/1000]	' that we need it . ' ' i 've got it . ' ' <EOS> ' , did you say all three of the ones are thinking of the big ' , was it really a lot
[482/1000]	my heart pounded , and i fought the urge to grab the light switch . " you okay ? " " fine . " he let out a deep breath and patted my back . " i
[483/1000]	a minute and forty - five seconds later , james 's light was flashing on my laptop . my heart skipped a beat . i could not believe it . i quickly checked around and then dropped my
[484/1000]	" the police report said you were injured . " " they 're working on it , " i said . " what did she seem like to you ? " " i told you , she
[485/1000]	i held a hand out to david , who did n't seem to recognize it either , and began climbing . i found myself standing in the middle of a huge amphitheater , right atop the edge of the
[486/1000]	but for all the hard work they 'd done they 'd still lost this once wonderful and wonderful woman . the last time he saw her he was convinced he was going to jump in the shark tank and drown
[487/1000]	" what did you think , that no one was awake ? " she shrugs . " i was n't too sure . " " you spent the night and you spent the next two days sleeping next
[488/1000]	i 'm not sure it 's quite the same , what with the whole world crashing down around us , but i believe . this does n't make things better . " when you said we should stop fighting
[489/1000]	but there are a million ways to solve this problem , " the monk said with a wink . jordan joined them . though the monk was probably right , he did n't like the fact that rhun was
[490/1000]	" are you going to leave me ? " she asked plaintively . " and if you love me so deeply that you 're willing to leave me ? " he had n't said it . his reply
[491/1000]	" hey , " he said . " hey , yourself . " " i thought there were other people here . " " there only been you and i for so long . " "
[492/1000]	" just make sure you call first if you hear from him early , okay ? " " but he did send this number . he also gave me this number . " " sure . if he
[493/1000]	" what do you mean by that it took - what passed for a few moments - for him to return to his senses ? " the question caught me off guard and i had to consider the answer
[494/1000]	" good , " he said . " you know ' no big deal . i mean , if you had some questions about a job in another lifetime , we could go over . but , in the meantime
[495/1000]	" okay , your choice , " she answers , and i can see the grin on her lips . " well , that 's your choice , mine . i 'm not complaining , though . "
[496/1000]	" we might still be able to survive this , " he said as he turned toward the door , then turned back . " it 's like we 're in a submarine . except we 're more likely to
[497/1000]	" you do n't think you need him after the way you 've been acting , " i say calmly . " i see all those women drooling over you . " " they did see me admiring you
[498/1000]	so why did she feel uneasy at the prospect that she might somehow be holding herself back from him ? in the meantime , she did her best to concentrate on the fact that she was being hunted and
[499/1000]	" i - i - " his throat suddenly felt too tight . " i want you to go . " " i do n't think i want to go anywhere right now . " she looked up at
[500/1000]	her eyebrows shot up , and she was looking at me like i was the crazy one . " i 'll be mad , but i wo n't let you jump to that conclusion . " " i have
[501/1000]	" you 've got it . come on . " he leads me slowly down the stairs , his arm on the small of my back . " you know you can call me james once you get in here
[502/1000]	" because you 're afraid to love someone . " " i am not afraid to love , " she countered , glaring at him . " i have my pride . i still care for him , and
[503/1000]	the day ended and there were no more boats to be seen . a full half moon appeared over the water and made it clear that not only was his mission compromised , but the river itself was under
[504/1000]	" the other one is probably just trying to avoid us . " " not likely , " he agreed . " it 's <EOS> other way to talk . " " not impossible , but impossible .
[505/1000]	but something terrible was riding him . when he got away from me , he decided he did n't want to spend the rest of his life with me . i should have been happy but i was n't
[506/1000]	i put away the papers . this is not good news . as the family grows , so too will the generation that will work against me . even before they go rogue , the legacy would be stronger ,
[507/1000]	" i ca n't do it for you , " he said . " you 'll have to sit here and get shot beside me . " " why ? i want to be with you . "
[508/1000]	" i still think you and aunt anne might have been more appropriate and comfortable with your mother 's death . " " yes , " he answered , " quite a dramatic funeral here , would n't you
[509/1000]	" you had to learn how to do it yourself , " she said defensively . " i could n't even teach you . i took training for a year and you already knew it . " " how
[510/1000]	" look , you asked me to do this . right ? i did that . it 'll still happen and it wo n't be from another man . " " do you dare . " " one
[511/1000]	" what 's that ? ' he said , pointing to the window . " a young man , dressed in a white robe . he 's been watching us from the corner . is your heart beating ?
[512/1000]	the way he said ' call ' i knew it 'd be a bad idea . not that things might end well . and they were n't likely to . the kind of thing you wanted to never want to
[513/1000]	" one thing i 've learned and some of it was pretty basic , " she started . " most people probably would have been happy of an entire country in one piece to take the life of it down
[514/1000]	' here . ' i handed her a handkerchief . a thin red welt looked like a giant bite on the black strip of skin under my fingernails . we sat down in the café and ordered coffee .
[515/1000]	" he loves the old , " my mother replied , and giggled . i had been so concerned about the funeral arrangements , because i had gotten a little teary - eyed right before the service . i
[516/1000]	then , as if it were choreogra phed , in a flash , the crowd exploded into a shower of glass shards and shattered plastic shards . the glass shards flew into the air and rained down , and i
[517/1000]	" and to the left , the road is impassable , the way is open to you , now , " she said . " you see , this was last year we found a small meadow full of deer
[518/1000]	he stepped in front of me . " what is it ? what 's wrong ? " i swallowed hard , staring at the small patch of snow from the roof of his truck . " did you take
[519/1000]	you can not take more than that , the voice declared . you already got me ; you know it and i ca n't take more than that . you 'll have to wait until you get
[520/1000]	i could feel the chill of the place sink into my blood and skin ; the air thickened and filled slightly by the fire , but it was n't too uncomfortable . i turned on the water again and
[521/1000]	" i can understand why you 're upset , " i said . " it 's the kid , " the woman said . " i just remember . he was so beautiful , his hair . i wanted
[522/1000]	the three men were silent . " oh ! " said william . " my fault . i forgot to say that . of course . you were watching the battle . " he laughed shakily . "
[523/1000]	" it 's nice to meet you , " the tall man said . " and you , " he replied , letting out a low whisper so only the other two could hear him clearly . she
[524/1000]	" i should have never agreed to it . " " you did n't think it would be stupid to sell out both clubs ? " my words are harsh and defensive . " it does n't matter
[525/1000]	" he does n't know who does . " " no problem . let 's see if we can get the one who knows . " " i am the one who will kill the dog , "
[526/1000]	i looked at my best friend for help . who did these people think they were to tell them such things ? whatever i may have said , it seemed to put a damper on their conversation . i wanted
[527/1000]	" and you 'll follow him ? " " i 'll make sure he has this information . " " that wo n't be necessary . have you got the car keys ? " " sure do
[528/1000]	" it 's not me . " he looked away . " what is it then ? " he came back to me and put a hand to my head . i took it , unable to look
[529/1000]	i was beginning to feel a little ill . " no you 're not . " he chuckled softly . " yes i am . " without another word , he picked me up and carried me toward the
[530/1000]	" i think we 've been down this road before , your lordship . " " i do n't doubt it . but i am not in the mood for games , mr. val lance . as i promised
[531/1000]	" there 's nothing wrong with her . this is about what " i shrugged my shoulders " but what you did today did n't make me like you any less . " i saw her chin tremble as
[532/1000]	" i do n't think so . " " well , you do n't seem like it . " he shakes his head then looks toward the crowd . " right after we have the band play for hours
[533/1000]	i am , indeed , quite fond of being inside you . more than that ; i like it . i want to know that you are enjoying yourself here . i want to hear that you are enjoying
[534/1000]	she tilted her head curiously . " so you 're serious ? " " more or less . but look , i know you wo n't give up the company i set up at the estate , no matter
[535/1000]	her dad was a lawyer for six years , and his job was to take care of her mother for ten , and when she got sick , she had to come over to the hospital to have her mother
[536/1000]	" will it be easier if we do this your way ? " he hesitated before answering , staring at his feet . " if you had to choose . " she did n't like the sound of
[537/1000]	<EOS> i stopped at some places , some places where i 'd seen the sign , and i followed the way i knew the path led me , toward a door . i stopped just before it , turning ,
[538/1000]	" you think so ? i 'll have to ask my parents . " " and your parents ? " " my parents will have a stroke this summer . " she laughed at the irony . "
[539/1000]	" we 've probably got about forty guys ... i wish i knew where ... " she paused then finally said , " thirty . will you tell me or not ? " " later . " they
[540/1000]	" i 'm going tomorrow , " she said . " you can come with me . " " but you 'll be ... you 'll have family ? friends ? " " that 's the plan ,
[541/1000]	he 'd asked the question with genuine concern in his voice , as though he understood that he had to keep her safe . and now they both knew it . he 'd never known love as he shared
[542/1000]	" what do you think , sister ? " he said . " would it work ? " " i think it would work . " i looked him in the eyes . " it 's very dark ,
[543/1000]	no ! it was the thought , not the voice . he shoved the thought away . he found himself pacing and shaking . as much as he did n't like it , none of this seemed right
[544/1000]	" to be damned it is so . " * * * a few minutes later they crossed a wide stretch of sand , the cool sands brushing her skin . for a moment she stopped walking ,
[545/1000]	" i can deal with the house . " or try to . my shoulders tense and my lips curl up at the corners . he nods , his own hands flexing and releasing . " if you do
[546/1000]	' not that i could tell , ' lenk said , sighing . and the aby smy th did n't sound like a great deal of help . after all , not much else matters , i guess . '
[547/1000]	" how do you know my parents ? " " the last time we were in a bar we were drinking a beer . " " huh ? you mean a beer . that was the last time
[548/1000]	" we should go . " " i wo n't be able to go because i just got here . and if they hear , they 'll kill me . " " why ? " " because
[549/1000]	" you 'll get over it . it 's a bit like how you 'll be a teenager when you 're only eighteen . " " exactly . and that 's why i 'm here , trying to decide
[550/1000]	he got his way , as he did most of the other things he did . he built a computer system , and he bought an air bus . he could work in the air force . he could do
[551/1000]	" i 'm glad to hear that . " the doctor nodded and pushed the drawer closed . " you seem like you 're in good spirits at school . " " i 'm fine . just a little
[552/1000]	the door opened . on seeing her , he tried to raise his sword and she knocked it out of his hands . " i should 've killed you that first night when i had you in that cage .
[553/1000]	i had nothing . without a word , she held up her hand , and i felt she wanted to explain . i sat down and put my head down on my hand in disbelief . she was right ;
[554/1000]	" i 'm not a child , " i say , " and you need to calm down and stop trying to scare me . " he turns on his side , putting his back to me . then
[555/1000]	" i will keep them away , " he promises . i know i may be going crazy , but i 'll keep my promise . " i love you . " " i love you ,
[556/1000]	" yeah , " i said , still staring at her . " so , this is why i think you guys were too nice to get together a few days ago . " " why not ? "
[557/1000]	it was one hell of a coincidence . he had walked right into the scene and left . he had moved as quickly to make sure none of it had happened earlier in the day . he was positive the
[558/1000]	" if it 's a secret " - he gave a cynical grin - " maybe , you can tell us . " the thought of having to listen to their secrets , to share them with someone else
[559/1000]	i frowned . he gave a deep sigh and folded his arms across his chest . " tell me about it . " leaning forward , i shrugged . " why ? your wife is n't any better ,
[560/1000]	that night she had to face her fears , to accept there was no way to go backward in time or reverse the past . i found it really sad how much she needed the time to grieve and to
[561/1000]	" are you not comfortable , sir ? " asked the younger of the two men . " no , go ahead and do whatever you wanted , " said haddington , " as was my intention , if
[562/1000]	" the only two ways things were different before we met . i 'm not sure where things stand now . " " but you love her still . " " do you not love me , angel
[563/1000]	the guy , sitting behind his desk , gave him a wicked smile . " i love the way mrs. ra dley talked about you last night . like you were a star in a show last night . "
[564/1000]	" fine then . " i pulled down my top . " i hope it 's a girl . " " you do n't need to worry about that , " he said , running his hands down my
[565/1000]	i was n't ready to answer this , but then my phone pinged . i went home to grab my phone . " hey , babe . " " hi , " i breathed . "
[566/1000]	" good point , " she said , which led to some strange questions . " but what about the kids in school , who <EOS> there ? what happens if they try to get caught ? " "
[567/1000]	i turned <EOS> with a smile on my face , a smile with enough mischief to make a five year old 's smile . " no , princess , " he whispered as he walked beside me , and
[568/1000]	" you better go home , " she says , her stomach roiling under her shirt . " if they found you with him there , they 'll start stalking you . so what if they walk , you 'll
[569/1000]	" so , how 'd you know , " she said eventually , " that the door i just opened is a false lock ? and that they did n't have the strength to even crack it to let you
[570/1000]	that stopped him dead in his tracks . he was surprised himself that any response had been his thought . " i 'll see you soon , " she said . " and ... i hope you 'll
[571/1000]	" there can only be one explanation . that , " he said , " is the man responsible for our deaths . " now his face took on a strange gleam , and he let go of me and
[572/1000]	" then i 'm going to work with her . " i nodded . when i came back into the sitting room , i was surprised to see ren standing beside his wife and sitting on his couch
[573/1000]	so we continue to stand there until my heart is thundering in my ears . i want to say how much i love her , how much i fear to lose her , how much i want to let her
[574/1000]	" how do you know ? " " right . " i knew he was standing over me . i could feel the heat radiating from him . " you just smell good ... like cologne and shampoo .
[575/1000]	" i should go soon , " she replied , reaching for her coat . it took him a moment to realize what she was referring to . " really ? " he asked . " it 's
[576/1000]	he pulled me close and kissed me . his tongue gently probed my mouth . i opened willingly and allowed him entry . i enjoyed his touch . it was as if he was testing the limits of
[577/1000]	" not about you , " she said . " about your brother . you 'll keep him safe if you take him back . no matter what he says , you wo n't leave your brother helpless . and
[578/1000]	" now , come along , old man . make a big show of it . " " yes , sir , " mr. drummond grunted . " and sit back and let me show you how ... how
[579/1000]	we made our way back through the main rooms and to the other side . when we made it outside of the building , i noticed there were more or less everyone 's phones , laptops with speakers and the
[580/1000]	" i 'm not sure why i 'm telling you this . you 'll probably never know . " " you do n't want to know , though . " " i would n't be a good doctor
[581/1000]	he does n't know that . " you do n't know what i did ! " i yell the words in a high - pitched , panicky voice , but i do n't care . do i really hurt
[582/1000]	" i believe it , " anna said . " but you look a little troubled about that . i know you were n't out partying or anything , was ... the parties are n't going to be easy .
[583/1000]	i had him right where i wanted him and he had him <EOS> right where he wanted to be . as he continued to grind against me , his hard length rubbing my clit , his mouth moved lower
[584/1000]	" i think this is going to be a problem , " dr. du pont said . " he 's here . " " great , great , " i said , trying not to sound sarcastic . "
[585/1000]	the old man rose , his face creased in sadness . a long , thin finger touched his cold lips and he stood with his back and shoulders straight , with legs slightly apart . he closed his eyes against
[586/1000]	' what 's bothering you , dear ? ' he shrugged . ' i dunno , ' he replied . ' the doctor came back after he finished with me last night . he asked me if i saw
[587/1000]	what could i offer ? i do n't have a lot to offer . how much money , where i went ? when i first entered college , my life had been simple , predictable . the only ones
[588/1000]	" they ca n't take you . " " but that 's how you can do it ? " " i have n't done anything wrong . " " yes , you have ! you 've stolen
[589/1000]	if i could , i 'd talk about this some more . i had a question to ask . " maybe you should . " " she is n't at school . i 'd take her and run her
[590/1000]	" did i say please ? " as though that was a bad word , he bit his lip , and lowered his head to kiss my left breast . he bit it gently at first . only
[591/1000]	" it 's a friend of mine , " said the man named johnny . " hey , i need to talk to you . " " what 's that ? " i asked . " can you
[592/1000]	she stared at the carpet , feeling like the biggest loser in the world . she knew for a fact that the letter containing her signature was also inside the envelope she had placed there in the night craw l
[593/1000]	" so how is your mother ? " " living with the mother of a friend and a client . " " i 'm happy for you . " " there 's something going on with them
[594/1000]	" i need to get down to the floor and try to save my mom and sister . before they find me . my sister looks older than my mom , but i still have the same feelings . and
[595/1000]	" it 's not a bad job , dad , " i say hesitantly . " some of the best tech i 've been on has long been part of a new technology people developed to create the perfect drive
[596/1000]	" do you still have ... " she turned to look at him . " do you still have a body ? " she asked with a sob . he could n't figure out how to answer , but
[597/1000]	" you look like you 've seen a ghost , " he reminded . " i 've seen someone . it was sort of a close call . " " then you were not the one with the
[598/1000]	" how dare you imply i was playing you ! you can not trust me ! to hear you tell it like it is , you are out of your mind ! " i was shouting , but only because
[599/1000]	and then he came . it was right in the middle of the morning . yes . it was . one big , hot , heavy , hard , hungry , so full of love , so much
[600/1000]	" for what ? " i whisper . " everything , " she says . she glances at her watch and then at the clock . " look . i want this a lot more than you do ,

[603/1000]	his eyes were glittering , but the anger was gone . he just looked bored , as if the whole thing never used to happen . " i would think that would , would n't you ? " "
[604/1000]	" that 's really all i can say . there are n't any stories available ! " " there must be something ! " " we 've got to go now . wait for me . trust me
[605/1000]	i turned to him and nodded . " you 'll be with your family tonight . " " okay , " he murmured and gave my hand a squeeze . when we made it to the door so
[606/1000]	" do you feel better ? " he asked as a nervous grin pulled at his lips . " i do . " it was true . she was a little wobbly around the place , but she 'd
[607/1000]	at first , she wondered if he had read the reports somewhere but then she pulled the last page of papers over and looked at the text . she was in the business of finding some facts , not finding
[608/1000]	" oh ! i heard about that . i tried to call you , " amy said , and i could tell she was feeling a little guilty about not saying hello earlier on . " i 'm done
[609/1000]	a small fire burned in the small wood stove . in its centre was large wooden block - it was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me , and i should n't think that it had anything
[610/1000]	" i have a plan . " as if she could believe that . " i 'm glad you told me . i hope you know this means everything to me . " their eyes met , and
[611/1000]	" <EOS> " - she dropped her face . " i 'll never get past the fact that you 've had me tied up , " she said , finally understanding . " she 's an alien - "
[612/1000]	she stopped to look at him with her blue eyes , " you do n't really care , do you ? " her question cut to him like a shock wave . " why would i be offended ?
[613/1000]	all the while the house was ringing . " you 're not thinking about running over to rescue him , are you ? " " no , " she answered . she liked how he recognized her and
[614/1000]	" is something wrong with the ring ? " he asked . i looked down , and he pulled his hand back . i blinked at the stone . " no . it is just ... i think ...
[615/1000]	but the more he did it , and the more she did n't think about it , the darker it became , the gra yer it became . " what 's going on here ? " hunter asked as
[616/1000]	why should it ? this was where the secret was keeping him . and if <EOS> also kept him , then what else would it be for ? he knew the way this town worked and therefore he would n't
[617/1000]	i 'd made it to the bottom on the stairs and was breathing hard before we reached the kitchen . the blinds were shut . we took a quick glance around to ensure no one else was around . "
[618/1000]	it is early evening when we finally pull the wagon up a long valley beneath the dark bulk of the mountain pass . the sun has set , and the air has turned to a chill and damp , but
[619/1000]	" you might as well give them an ear ful , " she shot back , and i thought i could see the beginnings of a smile forming on her face . " i do n't know why you 're
[620/1000]	it was pretty clear the new owners had no use for me . why put me in danger for putting our names together , especially if i went out with daniel ? or , more to the point , it
[621/1000]	" i am as excited for you as you are , " he smiled brilliantly . " and i think i know how to make our marriage even more pleasant than yesterday . " " how ? " rebecca
[622/1000]	" i know that i 'm a terrible father , " ruth said quietly , " but ca n't i at least be a mother ? " " of course you can be a mother to ruth , "
[623/1000]	" you know you 're not here as a guardian angel , do n't you ? " i shrugged . " the only other guardian angel i know knows is lucas . " " which means you need
[624/1000]	" no . he 's the commander . not me . " " right , " he said , and then he looked up at the ship , which was slowly descending . the ship was very ,
[625/1000]	" would you like to see it ? " i ask , but she just gives me a curt nod . as i walk her back to the car , i say , " i 'm sorry , babe
[626/1000]	i nod . " i guess we have the first step . " he pauses , allowing me to collect my thoughts , " are you doing okay ? you have n't been sick like that in awhile .
[627/1000]	she sighed . " if this changes nothing , you 're officially losing your membership . that 's not something i intend to let happen . " if he knew better , he 'd think she blamed him for
[628/1000]	he shrugged , not looking at me . " are you asking me to marry you if she does n't want to and if she 's doing it because you took their daughters to your bed ? " i
[629/1000]	" fuck , maddie , i 'm sorry , sweetheart . i know i 've done everything wrong but i 'm going to take care of you until i can take care of you ? when we 're home ,
[630/1000]	" if you do that , a great many people might go mad and want to kill you . but if that happens , " she turned to an old woman 's table , " i 'm not sure what
[631/1000]	" oh yeah , because i like to talk about men . is n't that good about sex ? " her voice softened . " do you like to ... watch ? " " watch what ? " he
[632/1000]	" no need ! " i snapped . " i can keep the dog for a while . " " no , you ca n't . he 'll jump on you . " i leaned into the dog
[633/1000]	" shit , " i murmured . " i 'm glad you 're here . " he took another long swallow . it was his second of the day . " i do n't know what i 'm
[634/1000]	" i did hope you would . " " how could you hope to get away from me ? it 's impossible . " " because ... " his voice trailed off . he cleared his throat .
[635/1000]	but he would have to spend more time in atlanta with his family too . he was n't in the mood for another big reunion . especially now that he 'd lost jane . " it 's none of
[636/1000]	" you can do <EOS> you can still live here , i 'll deal with it . the only thing i know is the three thousand mark . " " do you stand alone ? " david would
[637/1000]	" it has been known to happen . " " oh . how did it happen ... ? " " you do mind so much . you are a very nice person . " " i suppose
[638/1000]	i ca n't think of anything to say to that , so instead i just watch her as she walks down the stairs . she 's wearing one of our dresses this afternoon , her hair pulled back in the
[639/1000]	" was his family a real issue at the start ? " she asked . " do n't know . some of the papers have been filed and the city had nothing to go on . they 've filed
[640/1000]	" hey ! " emily hissed . " do n't even try to distract or you 'll get yourself killed . " then she pointed to the pool . " that 's where you 're about to drown ! "
[641/1000]	he had not noticed a third man running toward him . " i 'm ready . is the door fixed ? " there were at least two more approaching , taking up the sides of the doorway .
[642/1000]	she was crying with joy . and still a few years into the future , they 'd be discussing their child a lot more than they should . she would admit that , but she was n't sure she could
[643/1000]	" please do n't be mean , " she said . " but you ca n't have me because you 're too nice . " " now look . " he placed one hand on the small of her
[644/1000]	" i do n't know , i do n't and i do n't want to know . you 're in trouble . " then he was off and the car started rattling off . she was glad he was n't
[645/1000]	" do n't bother , " richard said . " i know how it is . i just want to make sure you know how i feel . " " yes , " she said . " want
[646/1000]	" she can be very stubborn , " claire said . her mother pulled her into a hug . " so you say , child . you are your mother . " for about half of dinner ,
[647/1000]	" sure . sorry . " then he told me that the job was not a burden , rather an embarrassment for me . <EOS> all the little things that i always forget . he said that he wanted
[648/1000]	after that , nothing more was said on the subject , and after a minute he walked away and came to open the door . " i was going to take you to lunch , but i guess i 'll
[649/1000]	" look , " i told him . " what i want to know is whether you two are ... " he broke down , and i did n't know how to say it because i could n't even
[650/1000]	for a few minutes he sat there gazing at the moon as the water appeared to glisten . slowly , the stars came out ; then he became aware that even the moonlight did n't help this situation . he
[651/1000]	she tried to hide her surprise . " do n't worry , i was n't expecting that . " and i was n't expecting you , either , she thought . but she was n't really sure about it .
[652/1000]	" what ? " she says under her breath , clearly irritated . " we 'll meet up for lunch tomorrow . " she looks at me as if i have lost it . " what ? "
[653/1000]	" as a matter of fact , he does . " " good to know . i need to get to work , then . good luck with your business . " she gave me a tight handshake and
[654/1000]	" that was a cheap shot , " i blurted out . " you 're right . back off , you big wimp . " i shook my head . " no , i 've been so scared
[655/1000]	do n't be so morbid . " how long have this been going on ? " " for as long as i can remember , " the man said . " there was this party last year , this
[656/1000]	as the night wore on , with the clouds blanketing the night sky , i started to worry . would she turn again ? would the sun actually come out by daybreak ? all the questions were flying through
[657/1000]	" i 'd rather not find out . " i felt myself slip into a bad dream , and everything flashed before my eyes . the pain . the tears . the pain . the fear . the screaming .
[658/1000]	" how do i know you did n't have something to do with matt dying ? " i want to say that i did n't kill matt by accident . i could have made him lose consciousness , and
[659/1000]	" no , " said tiffany . " i mean yes , but - do you think mr bun n sy knows about us ? " " he knows that my life is n't exactly free of trouble ,
[660/1000]	" no , " she admitted . " that wo n't do . i want to make love to you , <EOS> the way you make me feel . " damn right that was what she wanted . " then
[661/1000]	" do n't worry , i 'm not hurt . " the woman nodded , and her cheeks softened for a brief moment , before the first hints of concern began to seep into them . with one simple
[662/1000]	the truth is like a knife in my heart . just like that , my entire life changed forever . my entire existence was based on the man i loved , logan . we wanted the same things , the
[663/1000]	i got to my feet and walked over to where the others were . " did you hear any ? " i asked . " um , " they all said back at once . " what exactly
[664/1000]	" you seem quiet , " the little girl said . " quiet in your world . quiet when i 'm back at home . " he smiled . " not anymore . i 'm a bit of an
[665/1000]	' do you two mind ? ' she asked , watching the two of them . they turned in unison to her , startled . they were n't surprised to see that she was dressed the same way as
[666/1000]	" you 're joking . " her words were a question . " not on purpose . i was just wondering . " " you were n't suggesting <EOS> now , obviously . " she rolled her eyes
[667/1000]	where were all the bodies ? in her mind 's eye she could see that they 'd never been here until about a year or so ago . she and her brother had stayed through the blizzard , running
[668/1000]	he looks at me . " no . " " i was n't sure . " " i told you the truth . " the boy looks confused . so i turn to him . "
[669/1000]	the guards were n't following them . they were talking to each other in spanish . " oh , you got to be kidding me , they 're not following you , " diego said , jerking a thumb
[670/1000]	" so , you remember what the key is for ? " " well , i could check . " " you need to be cautious , you know , this case has a few unknowns attached to
[671/1000]	" i 'm fine . the wound will heal with time . " she took a deep breath , but it came out little more than a breath . " your parents have been looking for you , and they
[672/1000]	" you have been through hell ! i just do n't understand , you know ? " he did n't have time to elaborate on her question . " but you 've proven you 're worth the sacrifice ... "
[673/1000]	" when the time comes to give them the money , " john continued , " when they bring the money to the palace , i will send for the money . " " did you know that they
[674/1000]	i grabbed a pillow from the shelf and threw it through the window , i turned off the lights and pulled my blankets over my head . if he could only see me . but sometimes i wanted him
[675/1000]	" yes , but she was hurt , and i do n't honestly know how she 's doing . " " are you sure they do n't know where we 're staying ? with the location of that club
[676/1000]	" you want to talk about how a woman feels ? " i asked , trying to hide the hurt . because i 'd know , i 'd understand . " what is there to talk about ? "
[677/1000]	" yeah , i got a call from the hospital in boz eman . " " and you did n't call me , " i told him , now totally perplexed and somewhat worried . i never knew what
[678/1000]	" how come you 've never had a girlfriend ? " " someone always came on to me - some guy . they all felt sorry for me . " he shrugged . " i 'm not really a
[679/1000]	" i do n't appreciate you suggesting that so i might remind my fiancee that she 's dating a vampire who does n't deserve her . it 's not exactly a coincidence , " gavin muttered into his drink .
[680/1000]	" no . it would n't matter . i would never be the same . i will never see you again . " " then why would you want to ? " i do n't hesitate . "
[681/1000]	" do n't let them get away ! " i called to him through the open door . " watch the floor ! " then i was left staring at a blank wall , and a very real vision
[682/1000]	" now 's as good a time as any , " he said . " just for once we 're not trying to make the kids run back to their houses . we 're trying to find a way to
[683/1000]	" i do n't think the same was said on this job you 're supposed to do , " she admitted , and shook her head . " you do n't do it okay with your superiors , and they
[684/1000]	" what 's next , then we 've got to do the math , " i said . " well , this guy has been dead for over a year . i do n't know if it would actually
[685/1000]	she closed her eyes and concentrated , taking a moment to create a new body with small changes inside her . as she did , she opened to a human who was still standing and wearing a thick , furry
[686/1000]	i looked at ben and smiled . " yes . you 're totally right . " " is this an over reaction , or are you really serious ? " ben took the shot . " you 're
[687/1000]	" no , i did n't hear any of that . " " no , he did n't like it much . then about a month ago , his folks moved , i did n't know if it was
[688/1000]	" that was my thought . " " your thinking ? " that might work to my advantage . " yes , " she said . " you are the worst . " " if you think
[689/1000]	what was the subject matter of mr. noel ? the woman said to him , " there 's enough for today . you can check it in later . i 'm going to go to my office for a
[690/1000]	her voice rose so high it almost hurt . " that 's what i keep telling him ! people say i am so different . well , i 'm not . i 'm not . and i 'm not telling
[691/1000]	" they were right , they probably were , " i said . " it was n't a mistake to take our weapons out . they must have anticipated what we would do and fired on the first shot .
[692/1000]	i could hear everyone 's shouts of support as they joined us on the ground . the man was in full uniform , in a dark blue uniform and blue uniform , and had light blue eyes that gleamed behind
[693/1000]	" you think ? " " but what ? ! " " i just came by to see if we need help in town . " " we 're fine . i still have a few chores
[694/1000]	" ah , so the question is yes , i am ready for the truth . i 've never lied before , and i 'm not about to start now . " gabriel 's smirk became predatory . "
[695/1000]	but do n't you even attempt to speak until i tell you to . you may protest this . i do not want you to . but you must obey , or your mother might be hurt . "
[696/1000]	i turn to go , but the demon does n't follow . my knees feel weak . i want to call out a warning , to kill the demon who keeps appearing . but that 's crazy - my body
[697/1000]	" it 's your day , " he said to us , his finger pointed at the notebook in my hands . " it 's your life 's work . this journal . those fingers . the blood . and
[698/1000]	" how did we get here ? " he asked , walking around the counter and standing in front of me . i smiled when he leaned down and offered his hand . " the car , as i
[699/1000]	" this is n't your fault . " i looked at jack . " you 're not the only one . " " maybe , " he said . but i had n't felt the same . i was
[700/1000]	" so , who 're these people that they look like ? are they friends ? " i asked , unsure why i did . " some parents are . some parents are just ... what is the word
[701/1000]	" if you want more info , i can send you to my boss in chicago . he 's the one who will find out , " she told rick . " there is no way i 'm telling
[702/1000]	all of a sudden , i saw the green door behind that line of trees , as he 'd climbed to it in the dark . they had to go , i realized . they had to leave me
[703/1000]	" like the time i came out to buy condoms ? " if he did n't shut up , he was going to end up like his daddy . " i think you just called about that . "
[704/1000]	" there 's something special about her . " a chill ran down my back . " i guess i do n't like the new look of you today , " he said . " are you ...
[705/1000]	" the more you 're around me , " he said . " the more i spend with you . " " my bedroom was more the most beautiful room in my house , cole . " his
[706/1000]	" when it begins to get dark - " " after that , when it actually gets dark , i 'll have one of my men stop at our door and keep an eye out , " sarah cut
[707/1000]	when i finish i try my best to play it cool . i 've got every right to be here . i 'm in the middle of a pretty small party , after all . i 'm a senior and
[708/1000]	" no , " he whispered when he pulled back to look at me . " i put in a call about the rest of the crew at the hotel . " i did n't need to ask him
[709/1000]	in that moment , both of them were thinking the same thing : the thing to do here : the right thing , if the right thing was to follow along , right even though they both knew it
[710/1000]	* * * claire was standing at the front steps of sky 's house when it began to rain . light rain lightly lashed her face as she looked out across the little row of little houses , including
[711/1000]	" i do hope this one 's okay . " the captain waved , motioning to captain jacobs . a man answered the call , then a second , and that was that . the radio beeped and the
[712/1000]	" is he going to live ? " i asked . jared shook his head at me . " depends . has to . a few days when it 's over , though . we wo n't get anything
[713/1000]	" as a kid , she was already feeling low , running the neighborhood , " my mother went on . " our foster mother gave her a couple of jobs , not much , but maybe enough to help
[714/1000]	" do n't tell me that 's what happened . " " come on , it 's obvious . he 's from new york . he 's gorgeous and smart ; he 's kind of a jerk , but
[715/1000]	his mouth opened , but nothing came out . his nose wrinkled . she 'd taken a nip , that was all . " you did n't take my bite , " she said . " she did
[716/1000]	he raised a brow and made small talk with the two students sitting with them . the others nodded politely , but they did not look a thousand percent convinced that such friendliness would be possible with the mysterious man
[717/1000]	" i suppose i can fix it . " " it 's not your fault , " she said . " i do n't know . maybe i should find some other people and save the city .
[718/1000]	he could take no less than <EOS> a long time to walk . but the moment he saw a male figure moving around the corner he knew it was n't him . he stopped , put
[719/1000]	" you have a thing for her , do n't you ? " " no , " aidan snarled . " not yet , but it 'll get worse . " and in that moment , aidan tried
[720/1000]	" no , there are others out there , do n't make me kill you . you 're just the bait for them ! " he pulled the crossbow to his shoulder . " it 's time to go .
[721/1000]	" i do n't think she has any friends . so that 's why she was talking to you . do you know why you are here ? she has the power to stop you from touching her . "
[722/1000]	" no , " she said . " but that does n't mean they 'll stop . " " i guess it 's true that a man who 's never done anything was dead , too , " he
[723/1000]	he looks up at me . " will you talk to me ? " " about what ? " i pause , and then my mind goes back to a way down memory lane . " about the
[724/1000]	" my mother 's father gave me up , " sophie told her . " he was murdered in a car accident . " " i 'm so sorry , sophie . " the young adult man was
[725/1000]	" you 're not going ? " kylie demanded , feeling confused . " he asked me to chaperone . that 's it . " kylie was speechless . oh , my god ! that did
[726/1000]	" i knew you 'd come back when you were ready . " " how do you know about me ? " " i know a bit about you , if not personally . " " and
[727/1000]	she was lost in these woods , in this forest , and she realized she 'd never know where she was or what was going on . her life was complete , and she was alone , and this was
[728/1000]	his body stilled . he gazed at her , his expression one of concern . " are you okay ? " " i 'm all right , " she lied , even as she fought to focus on the
[729/1000]	with a grin , he kissed the tip of her nose . " you should also know that i love you . " " i love you , too . " he held her away from his body
[730/1000]	" what was that all about ? " " when the lady in your room was looking for her husband , she found him . " " when ? " " about an hour ago .
[731/1000]	" i would n't mind that , " i said . i got out of the car and walked around , open the door without being asked . all the lights in his house blinked on at exactly two
[732/1000]	" i 'll walk us , " he said , " but no guns . " " what do you mean ... all guns would be helpful , mr. evans , " said the young lady at the front
[733/1000]	chapter 10 on the fourth of july , in the heat of a summer day , the camp , or the closest place we could think of , was a five - mile cross - country field located next
[734/1000]	" i have the papers . " a sharp crack of ice ran down my spine . had my words gone too far ? he 'd decided to get rid of me ? " we already went over this
[735/1000]	her attention was entirely riveted on her reflection in the mirror -- no matter how long she gazed in the direction he 'd gone . the dress was strapless , and the fabric had a wide - thro ated vee
[736/1000]	david wanted the truth , but his plan was complicated enough without adding a few more unknowns . his friends probably could n't see him now . they 'd probably feel like their minds were drifting in some parallel
[737/1000]	" okay , i 'm listening , " emily said politely . mrs. fields nodded in satisfaction , then her face fell . " i 'm leaving , " she said . " thank you for this evening ,
[738/1000]	" so , where would i find any friends that i could invite ? " " well ... , you need a boyfriend . " " for how long ? " " forever " " that
[739/1000]	you can have all these for what you need to save the world . if you think of the future just as i 'm thinking of how to save the world , for instance , you will be prepared to
[740/1000]	' i do n't know , ' evan answered . ' if she was there , the lights were off . ' i could see from the light from the hallway that the window facing the sea was shuttered ,
[741/1000]	i saw her turn to me for the first time . in her eyes , i saw the question of how i could make more than my mark to me . she smiled at me , like she would for
[742/1000]	" okay , that sounded cool . i 'm in . " she held her hand out as she led him to the bedroom door . " hey , wait up . before we go to the wedding ,
[743/1000]	ryan nodded , but he was staring at the photo . " i know . " mom stepped toward him . for one horrible moment , we thought we 'd have to put him in the ambulance .
[744/1000]	alex ignored the interruption . " no , alex , it 's not fair . the last three hours were pure hell . " " i can just imagine . you do n't have a choice i can
[745/1000]	" okay , love . i love you . " i smiled lovingly , a sweet smile so full of magic and love it had me squirming in my seat . " i love you too , daddy . "
[746/1000]	" i see that we may have to put up with those two for a while more , " said the man , smiling . " that 's alright , " i said , " i did n't really
[747/1000]	' i think so , ' he conceded , though the answer did n't concern him . ' what about some ice for your ankles ? ' the young man laughed at her suggestion , and found himself
[748/1000]	" yeah , i know , it 's just ... " " i 'll be there in five minutes . " he hung up before she could stop him . i ca n't believe she 's dating
[749/1000]	" this is n't funny , " i said . " i 'm seriously not feeling great right now . " he gave me an earnest look . " i understand . but we need to be able to
[750/1000]	" well , your father would have wanted your father to know that there was something you were really worried about . he would have wanted it to be the surprise . " " it is . "
[751/1000]	i 'd had a lot of time to think over what i 'd heard about her , but i wanted to believe that maybe the fbi was here for her . " that sounds like a good start .
[752/1000]	" i see you have not seen the king 's son this summer , " said gra inger . " one word to the wise again , " said budsby . " do it with a smile . a
[753/1000]	" my eyes are watering , " he said , and squeezed them shut . it was hard enough to not cry . he did , too , and his wife pushed up beside him . there was nothing
[754/1000]	" you going to work today ? " he asked . she glanced at him as if she 'd never seen him before . " that 's a better question . " " i 'm trying to keep
[755/1000]	" i do n't want anything from you , max . i can handle myself . you can stay the night . " his hand did n't close around her head , but he did n't take his hand
[756/1000]	when you were a kid , they 'd hide in your closet . you 'd be the one making all the noise to someone in the street . do n't do it ! i begged all the time with them
[757/1000]	" i know it , mother . that 's what i 'll do , " he said in a resigned tone . it was n't the kind of words a young mother would use , but there it was .
[758/1000]	" well , i do n't know what you have planned in your head , but i have one thing to say to you , " he growled into her hair . " what 's that ? " she
[759/1000]	" i have too . " i turn to head inside . " let 's go . " " so it 's all a cover story ? you 're here to cause trouble again ? you 'll end up
[760/1000]	i started to walk to the staircase . " it 's fine . we 'll take the stairs back . we 've never been up this way . " i pointed to the left . " i bet if we
[761/1000]	" that 's not going to work . what 's the big deal ? " " think of it as taking a personal interest in our lives . " oh hell , my mouth watered . " this
[762/1000]	" i guess we had some things to discuss , " he said . " i took a shower earlier , " she said . she was washing off the grime of the day . " you did
[763/1000]	it was n't at it , not when he told me then . not when my eyes went blank and i felt the warmth of a tear fall on my throat . not when he slipped his hand under the
[764/1000]	" no sir . " " okay , stay inside . " " i want to see everyone . " " be in front of the trucks , and bring back a basket of food . "
[765/1000]	" it 's called being an immortal . all of us have our abilities , and they 're just as unique as their owners , but so many are left when the world ends . even the humans now .
[766/1000]	it was n't a real conversation . it was all like a dream . everything i did , everything i believed , every gesture , every kiss - it was a dream , and not a real conversation .
[767/1000]	" i was only going to say that ... " his voice came out ragged and hoarse . " i remember . " my tone was soft , giving no indication that he 'd heard me the first time
[768/1000]	" nothing , " i whispered . " really , i do n't . " she seemed to relax with my saying that . " i see . " " so , i guess it had better not
[769/1000]	" my car , " i say . " i 'll be back by 9 :30 . " " right , " he says . " it 's already ten in the morning . you can stay later .
[770/1000]	he moved , the sudden movement so unexpected , i knocked into him . " do n't . " he pulled from me and moved to my hands . " do n't what ? " i wiped my
[771/1000]	" we 're going to be ok . you never know , we might find an animal that wo n't bite . " <EOS> or some other creepy creature they could keep themselves away from . maybe one of those
[772/1000]	he could n't see the end of the world , he realized suddenly , but he could see the edge of , the end of it , for once . it was just a vague line moving across his world
[773/1000]	" just sit . he has n't yet and we probably should n't listen without actually asking the question . " no sooner had the words left my mouth then i felt my skin heat . now i understood
[774/1000]	' they 'll be out of the country soon , ' he told the others . ' i 'll walk them to work and get them back out here before they cross the border . ' they spent the
[775/1000]	he stepped back into the hallway . " thank you , " he said , holding out a hand to the man who was standing by his apartment door . " i 'll be up in a second . "
[776/1000]	he rolled her over , forcing her to lay on her back with him behind her spread open on his bed . with a flick of his wrist , he eased her legs apart , setting her feet apart again
[777/1000]	" i do n't know why you 've worried about me , " she finally responded , " i 'm fine . " " you are in better spirits today , are n't you ? " he asked and
[778/1000]	not until you and i share a kiss do i forget the name of our child . chapter thirty - four i felt a cold , heavy weight pressed against my chest , and heard the rustle of
[779/1000]	the men were mostly young , very handsome men , a little older than jeremy , but she had never felt comfortable with any more than a few of the men . she 'd tried to flirt with them and
[780/1000]	" can we please have a quiet little chat , on my job ? " " a short chat wo n't be a problem , mr. coughlin . " joe stopped before , his foot on the last
[781/1000]	" no . i think it 's different when it 's an act , and you make it a little more sexual because of that , too . " " well , i disagree . " " you
[782/1000]	james watched her hand go still and his lips pursed . he swallowed hard . there was only one thing he could do now , make sure she was okay . he reached into his pocket , felt for the
[783/1000]	" oh , you are such a ... a , but you 're totally , incredibly ... " she had to bite her cheek to keep from rolling her eyes . this had to be the girl from the
[784/1000]	" you remember that thing with the woman ? " he asked in a voice filled with a faint sense of amusement . " yes , " she breathed . " i was about to give you the
[785/1000]	" that explains at least one thing . i 'd love to marry another vampire , but even i 'm not immune from that kind of magic . " she pulled his hand down and gently raised his fist to
[786/1000]	i was tempted to tell him that he was n't my dad but decided that was an unnecessary argument . no matter how many years after i was married and with plenty of time on my hand , i 'd
[787/1000]	" uh - huh . " he 's trying to think of an appropriate conversation . i must be killing him by the way he 's staring at my throat . " let me get this straight .
[788/1000]	" well it ca n't be any more than a year , or two because this thing that we 're dealing with is already starting the countdown . it must be building its own timetable , but - " but
[789/1000]	she slid out of bed and moved her way to the shower . without waiting for him to make the call , she turned on the water until hot water poured over her naked body . when she stepped out
[790/1000]	" how close are we , you got that ? " " uh - huh . i 'm about three feet away , and my feet are only an inch or so off the ground . " "
[791/1000]	" we found the body of an old human , i believe , in great falls . " " i like vampires , " said daniel . " but i do n't really want to eat in a crypt
[792/1000]	" you should know us , " said jace . max lifted his black eyebrows . " we 're shadowhunters , " clary said , quickly . " we have a right to be here , you know
[793/1000]	" i do n't want to hear this , " i protested . " i ca n't believe you 'd do that for me . " i heard a chuckle behind me , and i spun around , but
[794/1000]	he did not mention the other , which she already knew . " how must the world be ? " she asked . " does new jerusalem belong to the arabs ? will it be a new , prosperous
[795/1000]	it was very large by this point . i took the little metal ladder from the rail and hung on for dear life . i could n't let go , of course , and when i fell , i hung
[796/1000]	" that was okay . i 'm just surprised . that 's all . " " that was nice , " she said . " you know i 'm only leaving because you called . " " yeah
[797/1000]	" i can explain , " i say , " but i 'm not happy with what you have to say . if you have a problem with what 's going on , then move on . i 'll take
[798/1000]	" that guy is on his way to vegas , " i said in annoyance and i could tell that jason did n't believe me . he had n't been there . preston had gone to preston 's house without
[799/1000]	if i 'd had a choice , i would n't have asked . i would have moved on , i know i would have . i could n't have let her walk out on me again . no ,
[800/1000]	' will you come away ? ' asked angelina . ' i 've some errands to run first . ' ' okay . ' angelina closed the window , turned on her ipod and set it '
[801/1000]	" i see , " alice muttered . " i guess there are some things that you just have to get over . " " i would n't mind seeing you again however i can . " alice
[802/1000]	ryan 's grin was devilish , and the warmth that flooded through me was n't a typical tingling sensation . i had to fight against the urge to reach out and cup his face . ' you 're not
[803/1000]	" no , i suppose not , " she said with a small smile . " why do you ask ? " that was what she supposed they were doing , waiting on the priest to show up . "
[804/1000]	it did n't help much . just a week ago , he 'd been telling me lies , just like he 'd lied to me that night in the tavern . no matter how i searched , he 'd evaded
[805/1000]	" with your help , we could establish a foundation to help humans . " " you speak in the same vein as peter , " the young woman interrupted . " my dear ian , peter is only
[806/1000]	' what would you have done ? ' she asked , trying hard to keep the quiver in her voice from betraying her . ' if it required a further investigation , i would go and find him .
[807/1000]	" if you do n't mind my asking , then what kind of music are you into ? " i smile . " well , you know i like all our classical music . " " sure
[808/1000]	so now that i thought about it , was it only in my head . i had experienced the feeling that i could read , at least , the letters , i reasoned , and in order to read them
[809/1000]	" and so he knew himself , " said dr. opp en heimer . " one who knew himself , and of whom he knows himself . " " what is this - a new species ? " asked
[810/1000]	he nodded and walked slowly up the stairs , the cool of the night enveloping him . " wait , " she called out to him . " i need to ask you something . " his back
[811/1000]	" do you - do you also think back to when you were a little boy ? " i shake my head . " no . i remember being this scared when i was seven and having to be
[812/1000]	" sure . we 're friends , right ? " " okay . " she grabbed my hand , and we started walking . " you 're the first one i 've talked to since you got back from
[813/1000]	' no . i think it might be more complicated . ' harry nodded absently , staring into the distance . ' i 've been there . my heart aches for myself . ' ' is that so
[814/1000]	" hey , " i whispered in the dark . " he 's not who you think he is . " " but he 's the f * * king prince , " she whispered and my entire world
[815/1000]	" oh my god ! " i cried out , completely forgetting my earlier mortification . jared 's mouth pursed , and he shook his head . " i thought you could use a friend . " "
[816/1000]	the man was an old man and his mouth was almost in the middle of a full toothless grin , but not quite . <EOS> but , of course , the size of the man in front of the
[817/1000]	the other guy looked down , giving her a " thumbs up , " which emma had to take on a second glance . " what 's up , bud ? " she asked coolly , feigning friendliness .
[818/1000]	what did she need to say ? she shook her head at his blatant obtu seness . she felt like she had n't told anybody about any of this , not even liam 's mother , or his childhood family
[819/1000]	" what 's her problem ? " aidan raised a brow at me . his jaw looked rigid , like he kept clenching it , like his jaw muscle coiled to shut down whatever was happening inside him .
[820/1000]	" ah , " he gasped . " would you be willing to marry me ? " " go to hell ! " she hissed , shoving him away . he stumbled backwards until he hit the table with
[821/1000]	" she 's our daughter , you see , " he says , " she 's the sister of one of our own . she and the children are being raised together . we have all but lost touch ,
[822/1000]	" i 've never been here before . you can trust me . " i stared at him , surprised . part of me was so excited that he had just confirmed my suspicions , but what if he
[823/1000]	he blinked as he took a step when he felt her touch , then a second one when she moved closer to him . instinctively , he reached out to take three of the containers of cream and sugar .
[824/1000]	" i 'm so sorry , " he said . he leaned in to kiss her again , this time with more force . she took his face between her hands and pulled him out of her embrace .
[825/1000]	" it 's not , " i panted . i felt a tear tear escape as i tried to press it back down , smearing my smeared mascara . " it 's her own magic . the devil 's daughter
[826/1000]	he moved his arms to the bed , pressed the sheet hard against her lower . he was still hard , but he loved the feel of her and wanted her to understand just how much she gave to him
[827/1000]	he just looked at her , as if she 'd ruined everything . " the way you acted when you lost him did n't break my heart as much as the idea of ever loving you . " he added
[828/1000]	they stood still , feeling the cold air on their naked bodies and trying to figure out what to do next . each had a question but was sure he really wanted to find out . as one he closed
[829/1000]	and then it was over . " what are you talking about ? what do you mean ? " his body was stiff , and he did n't take his eyes off it . " i really do n't
[830/1000]	" your brother is not to go to gaol , by the way . " " i 'm afraid not . he 's working for a firm . " i took a deep breath . " but he 's
[831/1000]	' why did it take so long ? ' george asked . ' i thought he was going to give that back to you ! ' ' do n't you wish ? ' george gave her a confused
[832/1000]	he looked over his shoulder at her with an expression of surprise and something else . ' how do you know you can do this every night ? ' ' i 'm a fast learner . ' she gave
[833/1000]	" you told father you had an extra - large egg , " he said . " i 'll take care of that . " " oh , you will , sir . you 'll get plenty of nourishment
[834/1000]	" and why would i need an order of food ? " the prince laughed ruefully . " you are asking me on a very personal level , my lady , but it would not be wise for you
[835/1000]	" you know there 's no alcohol in the basement rooms . " " of course they 're not . " " and i saw a bottle of vodka on the floor . it was n't legal .
[836/1000]	" do you have any idea how hard it is to be this close to another human being ? " " yes , i think i have . " " you 're such a bitch ! " i
[837/1000]	" how long <EOS> ? " rachel looked at chris , but he was distracted , still looking a bit confused . " i do n't know . " " i do n't know either , " said kevin
[838/1000]	she looked at him a second . ' do n't use that word tonight , ' she said . ' it 's always made me nervous . ' this caused his grin to widen . as a consequence ,
[839/1000]	they stood for a long time at the edge of the clearing , listening to the sound of the surf and the seagulls squawking their sweet kit es . water lapped at the shore the way an old sailor might
[840/1000]	" not that it would be unusual for her to run off with a man . from what i gathered , however , she is quite active in the church and thinks nothing of the relationship between her and the
[841/1000]	" why do n't we go over there and talk ? " i suggest as i turn off the water . when i get out , i grab my hand . she follows without comment . " do you
[842/1000]	" so long as she did n't lose it the night you tried to get that business , she could keep it , could n't she ? no one would blame her for that . " " no one
[843/1000]	he pushed forward the door , past a couple of guards who stood smoking and watching the whole thing unfold . he turned to the trio and grinned . " so you do get the lead . i like that
[844/1000]	" a little . " he closed his heavy - lidded eyes and stroked a hand over the rumpled hair . " but only because they 're all worth holding a grudge over . " she did n't want
[845/1000]	we made it to the hospital and quickly got out , just in time seeing a man running towards us from the hospital entrance . i dropped the picture and kept running towards the ambulance . " where are
[846/1000]	" why ? " " he wants to see my brother , as soon as he can get out of here . we 're going to start looking for them again . " " who told you that
[847/1000]	" do you forgive me for that ? " rachel asked . " for what ? " he asked with a smirk . " what are you apologizing for ? it was worth it . " " i
[848/1000]	" he likes to think he 's the one , " said the vampire . " but you know what ? i like him just the same . " " okay , just one more chance for this ,
[849/1000]	i sighed . i was n't ready to do this . i could n't be friends with that demon that had destroyed my life . " good luck , " he said to me before he walked away .
[850/1000]	i nodded , closing my eyes . i was n't sure what else i could do . as much as i had longed to stay with my grandparents , they would always be there when i woke up and i
[851/1000]	" it 's probably just a little pressure . you have to remember that this is n't the first time you 've had a ' bad blood ' . " " i know , " said faye . "
[852/1000]	" you know that my father bought this place every day . i could stay here all day . " " you do have family here . " " well , i do n't want any of them
[853/1000]	" ' twas ... was i ... " the man shrugged . " there is a way , aye ? ' n ' it would seal the fate of their souls . " " and while you were saying
[854/1000]	not today . not around her . not before the sun was up . time to be herself again . chapter five they reached the town of k ona after only a few hours of hiking .
[855/1000]	there was a crack of thunder just outside the glass door . she looked across the table and then down the path to the bathroom . with more slowness - and much more self - consciousness - she picked up
[856/1000]	" we 're headed to charleston for a few days while the press releases are going wild . we are going to get our first big article . we figured we would spend a weekend in charleston , and fly
[857/1000]	she waited . all quiet at first . they continued to stare at each other . " why do n't you just go away , " she said . " what do you want me to
[858/1000]	* * * the following day , when the bell rang to signify class was over for morning classes , i had to give it a moment to settle . what was i thinking ? just one quick -
[859/1000]	" i will , " he whispered , closing his eyes . " i 'll see you today . " the sound of the front door shutting made all of us frown , and i looked inside . the
[860/1000]	" thank you . i really appreciate your help , mr. o' dona gh ue . please take care of him . " " your brother does n't want our help now , a man is here to scare
[861/1000]	because his dad believed him . if that was n't proof enough , evan figured he could say it over and over today that his mom had been his best friend - one of the few people he 'd ever
[862/1000]	with a soft groan , she slid down his body . his powerful arms encircled her , crushing her tightly against him . he kissed her fiercely , nipping at her lips in the most teasing way . she groaned
[863/1000]	" yes , i understand . " he said . the boys were good at following instructions . they never did " what kind of car did you pick ? " that is , they never tried out for
[864/1000]	' not at all , ' said teppic flatly , thinking that he 'd never had much good fortune . ' no ? who is it ? how can you tell ? ' ' it 's my uncle
[865/1000]	" what do you mean the others ? " " there are only about six of them , no , they are all gone because we started the raid , nothing more . " he is getting angry and
[866/1000]	" here . " i handed him half of the pack and slid the contents across the table . " there 's one more for all of us , too . my mother wo n't mind . " "
[867/1000]	the second person she thought of was his driver , who happened to be a friend of hers from that evening . the poor guy looked like he might have met his end about ten years ago . while he
[868/1000]	" we take down as many as we can , use whatever tools you have with you . there are things you can do to stop them , too . just get on . " she ran , ignoring
[869/1000]	it was the first time he thought of what his family had put their money into . a job . well , he 'd probably be in good shape when he got back to seattle ... an hour later
[870/1000]	" does he know about this ? " " no . " she was on her feet while i was sitting on the floor . she sat next to me and watched as i poured iced tea into a
[871/1000]	" no worries , " replied ryan enthusiastically . " here , you 're safe with us . " " i 'd stay away from the air force ; i do n't fit in perfectly , " she replied
[872/1000]	" i 'll read it and memorize its writing . i think it represents how to kill her . she 's never been able to do that , and now she wo n't . who knows how she 'll react
[873/1000]	" that too , " he said quietly . the moment he stood there , she pulled back on the reins . the horses had found a firm part of the hill and were already following the others .
[874/1000]	" that , " joe said to this stranger , " is another thing i 've noticed about you . in the ten years since we rescued you , i 've seen you with another couple with no kids ,
[875/1000]	" here you go . " kate handed her four - inch heels and a purple blouse to him , but the one beneath the skirt was still damp with his sweat . mitchell walked over to the kitchen
[876/1000]	" fuck ! " said jonathan , but no one responded . he turned the radio to static and went up to the main mast . there was a gap between it and the mast , a foot in gaps
[877/1000]	" she does , " i said . " she loves you . she loves us both . " he smiled . " i hope that 's the truth , " he said quietly . i had to wonder
[878/1000]	' i told you in the beginning that i wo n't agree . they are too afraid of him to think , and there 's a sort of power we have that gives us control . he wo n't have
[879/1000]	" i believe in you , " i answered slowly . " there are things we can do to help . your first step is to find dr. ro swell and find out if this thing is true or not
[880/1000]	she raised her hand to cut his answers short but before she could , he had her by the waist and had her back against the wall , his face close to hers . " i know that you 're
[881/1000]	" because it 's a matter of opinion . " " is that right ? " " it 's really over . " " but you say when they had you in that chair , you could
[882/1000]	* * * * if you 'd care to know , it was n't exactly a coincidence that my brother , eric and mark were at the restaurant for lunch a couple of days later . we were sitting
[883/1000]	" what ? " lucas asked . " the plan , " i said , pointing . " the plans . we have to move now ! you 're still on your guard twenty - four / seven ,
[884/1000]	' good luck , ' said mr bo gg is . ' if things go wrong i 'll know you wo n't fit in here . ' ' that 's very nice of you , mr bo gg is
[885/1000]	i could n't get close enough , so i kept going until someone told me that james was n't being held inside any longer . i did n't know if it meant that he was n't safe , but i
[886/1000]	" and we 've agreed on another appointment next week , " i say . the door opens then , and amy steps in . she freezes when she sees me , as if she 's all in a
[887/1000]	" he had no choice , " another voice added . " we ca n't afford to keep thinking everything is a thing . if they 're trying to kill us , it 's because they 've gotten through to
[888/1000]	the man smiled at the boy 's apprehension . " you 're a brave lad , boy . <EOS> and i think you 'll do just fine . " " thank you , sir , " said the
[889/1000]	i put my head on her shoulder again and told her softly , " then there is nothing left . " chapter twenty - five my life is always on fire two years later , i 'd
[890/1000]	" but you would n't , would you ? " i had not been prepared to ask , because i felt that i had no right to , that she could not confide in me , even to someone
[891/1000]	he reached across and took her hands . she squeezed back , wanting the contact . he was a little out of body experience , but he did n't try to change the way he felt or mess up her
[892/1000]	the first time we talked about something like this , i was mortified . i 'd known that kellan had n't asked for marriage right away . after last night , yes , i trusted matt and i trusted kellan
[893/1000]	or maybe it was n't , something was n't right . i pressed myself up against the stone wall , pressing my hand against the floor . so strong was the wall that it gave way , and i
[894/1000]	" who ? " i said , " the old man <EOS> said it was n't relevant anymore . that 's why you would have known a lot of that stuff . that 's why someone was looking at
[895/1000]	you are alone in the world . do you never have to see the beauty of the universe ? do you see the magnificence of the stars or the darkness of the atmosphere ? even if millions were to set
[896/1000]	" are you going over to dinner ? " " i 'll keep an eye on you . " " thanks , mom , " he whispered , as he hung up the phone . as he

[906/1000]	" we 'll talk tomorrow . " " okay . " " good night . " she stared at him with her big gray eyes . he grinned and put the phone down , but he did
[907/1000]	" yes ! " " you , " i whispered to him . he held my gaze . then he murmured , " leah . " " i know what you did to him , "

[913/1000]	* i could feel the pull of love to her soul . i knew the earth was dying , but this time i did n't care . i did n't matter . there was nothing but a fire smoldering
[914/1000]	she said , " yes . " " good . " " so , when do i get to have a phone ? " the lawyer opened the file again . " here 's the check
[915/1000]	" i love you . " i hugged her again and then kissed her cheek . " i love you too . " epilogue i stood at the foot of the stairs that led down to the

[917/1000]	he took my hand , pulled me on his lap and pulled me in to his chest . i snuggled into his embrace . " can i ask you something ? " i asked , trying to be casual
[918/1000]	" why do i tell you ? " " so long as you answer truthfully you should n't leave the house . " he laughed again , and those green eyes looked at her with amusement and affection
[919/1000]	" why ? " the woman pointed in the direction toward the bridge . her words were barely a whisper to those present . " they 've taken the bodies . " tucker swore . " that 's
[920/1000]	the police had been down <EOS> i could n't do a lot about it . i was a little surprised with the question of the girl who 'd broken into a high - top hotel . what had been

[922/1000]	" just to tell you . it was n't because he kept sneaking into my room during the month of october . i came running to him on the friday , when it was freezing out . i 'd taken
[923/1000]	" go be the man he wants . " she moved to the doorway and held her hand out . with a heavy sigh , the woman laid her hand in jennifer 's , and she escorted the woman away
[924/1000]	" not until you answer me if you want to stop . " " i 'm not sure ... " then he stopped . finally , he nodded . " <EOS> ... you 're doing this . "
[925/1000]	i nod . " i think that 's about it . " her grin disappears . " well , there 's nothing else to do , then . " " okay . " i lean back . there
[926/1000]	* * * the two men were still laughing under her bed . " what ? " i asked . " that 's funny . " " you 're a dick sometimes , babe , " he said
[927/1000]	" i will , if i can be of use in this situation , " i replied , standing closer to him as i got closer to the mirror 's face . " you look good . " he
[928/1000]	" i guess that 's possible . " " i used to see pictures of a lion that had been tamed . we 're all here in this house , and our mother loved to look out over her
[929/1000]	" that is quite un helpful , " said merlin . " not necessarily ; his magic is more complex than you think . the magic in question is much more potent than any other , for starters .

[934/1000]	" we ca n't do anything for no one , " he growled . " she 's probably right , " i said , but felt sorry for the witch . he had n't moved on , and

[936/1000]	they are going to do some experiments . and experiments like this are different from some other experiments . " after that , i knew it was time to find a place for the others . and soon .
[937/1000]	" does that sound wrong to you ? " " no , it sounds ... nice . it 's fun to watch our new friends playing with their cars . and it 's so much fun to watch you
[938/1000]	he rubbed one eye with a shaking hand , looked over at the doctor who had called on him . ' what 's wrong with doctor ra jan ? ' tobin asked . the doctor now sat looking at

[941/1000]	" i ca n't . " that was the only thing he could say at the moment that did n't sound too desperate . " why not ? " a sudden thought occurred to him . he gripped
[942/1000]	the other six stared at their boots as if he were a deer caught in the headlights of a bullet . how had he turned that shade of gray ? never in his entire life had someone looked so frightened
[943/1000]	" i know . " i turn to look out of the window , but i ca n't keep it together . my hands are shaking and i can barely focus on the pictures in front of me .
[944/1000]	" right , you have one for today , then ? for it 's nearly two thirty . " he took a deep breath and released it with a smile . " yes , sir , that 's it
[945/1000]	what . and she did ? <EOS> " yes . " that meant he thought she was crazy . her hand slid up his chest to his neck and he looked up at her then into her face
[946/1000]	" i do n't do those things . " " the hell you do n't ! " " i do n't anymore , david . not without a fight . " she closed her eyes . " this
[947/1000]	" yes , " she murmured , then remembered that the other side was hidden from view by the night . " oh , here . " she reached to the small canvas bag hanging from the tree .
[948/1000]	" there are other ways to open the gates . they only hurt vampires . you are the only one that does n't need to be worried about these things . " " yeah ? do you think they
[949/1000]	but he could n't blame her for that . and the fact was , he was pissed . and it was why he 'd come here . " i 'm sure it wo n't be a big deal .
[950/1000]	" you can rest now . you 're going to be late . " " i hate it when he gets cranky . " " it 's not a cranky guy . it 's a concerned father figure
[951/1000]	" let me go ! " she cries , struggling a little but unable to break his grip . " just a little , just a little , " he promises . he 's desperate to make her his
[952/1000]	" we have to hurry . i left my jacket in the car . " " what ? " " it does n't matter , i have to get out of here now ! " i looked
[953/1000]	i gasped and threw my head back . " no ! " she started to laugh , and her laughter spread to her eyes . she looked so happy as she bent down and kissed me . i

[955/1000]	" let it go , " i answered , giving up and crossing my arms over my chest . " whatever . let 's just go . " he watched me thoughtfully for a moment and then sighed .
[956/1000]	there was a moment 's pause . " well , that leaves you and your two sisters , " said sister mary elizabeth . " but i thought they - " said sister margaret , bewildered . "

[958/1000]	i stare at that tattoo and it grows longer and longer . i run my fingers across it , from my back to my head . it looks strange , but i think it 's what it means . it
[959/1000]	he just looked at her for a moment , but then reached out and pulled her gently into his arms . when she did n't resist he settled himself the rest of the way down on the bed , and
[960/1000]	she looked as miserable as i felt . she started to cry and hugged me tight . only the fact that she had chosen me on the spot prevented me from dragging her to the house with me . once

[963/1000]	" good night , daddy ! " with a little skip and a wave of his hand , she hurried up the sidewalk and across the porch , knowing her father would n't be home for a couple of hours
[964/1000]	" you 're welcome . " i gave him a look that said he was missing the point , like he did n't get that . " what do you need ? " i asked . he did n't
[965/1000]	" is it ? " richard said . " the thing that killed them , the black swan , is in california now ? how is that possible ? and now it can kill anyone else . " she
[966/1000]	" i know he does n't see it like that ; trust me ; he sees a very special woman . he 's married now to a really smart and beautiful woman . " " oh , yeah ,
[967/1000]	" yeah , i think so . does this mean she likes the green ? " " yep . just like it 's raining down on us here , i guess . " " yeah . "
[968/1000]	' i will say no more of this , ' vanion told me quietly , standing up and picking up his axe . ' good , ' i replied , rising to my feet . ' let 's go
[969/1000]	" i know , i - i 'm sorry . i was n't thinking , " he said . " here you go , and no one can see you . not now . not ever . so tell me

[976/1000]	" so how 's life treating you ? " i swallowed . " do n't i have a say ? " she cocked her head curiously over at me . " one of two things , really .
[977/1000]	" the only things in that bag i can keep is ' my best and i love you . ' or i 'll give it to them by courier to give to you later . " she smiled ,
[978/1000]	" you did n't . you took your chances , and you did well . " she did feel very successful , but she was still annoyed that they had n't been able to use their powers . she
