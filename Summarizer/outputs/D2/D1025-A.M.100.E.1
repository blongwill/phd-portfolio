Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Bears within the parks would remain federally protected.
Grizzly habitat is being threatened by development, and the bears' food sources also are at risk, she said.
If adopted, the proposal would apply only to bears outside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
Bears also have died after being shot by hunters claiming self-defense or saying they mistook a grizzly for a black bear.
