The soccer federation, which permits headgear but does not endorse it, fears that its wide use would undermine the assertion that soccer is a safe alternative to football, Skeen said.
Why wouldn't you start protecting people?"
"I'm on the fence," said Paule, who was not paid to endorse the headgear.
Brad E. Kodesh, president of the A1skateboards.com Web site, which sells skateboard equipment, said he did not think the law was necessary, because "ultimately, I think, wearing a helmet is the rider's decision; it should be enforced by the parents."
"It doesn't have to be very cold," Hoffman said.
"I think it's very good for safety."
