Listeria was a real problem for the United States in the  mid-1980s, said Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, but the government declared zero tolerance for the pathogen.
Listeria levels dropped sharply, Crawford said.
Fewer than 2,000 people in the United States report serious illness from listeriosis each year, but about one in four of them die from it.
Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.
About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are reported in the United States each year.
