Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be intact with some badly burnt.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.''
Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
The dead included 48 Greek Cypriot children and youths on a holiday school trip to Prague, a spokesman for Helios said.
