Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
The 14th case in Japan was confirmed last week.
Mad cow sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry.
The Japan National Institution of Infectious Disease confirmed the infection after conducting detailed checks on samples from the cow, which tested positive Monday in an initial examination.
