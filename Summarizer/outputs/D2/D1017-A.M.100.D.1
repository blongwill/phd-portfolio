FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles  east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye blowing at 155 mph.
It's very scary,'' Bush said.
Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
