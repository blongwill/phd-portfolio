Frogs and other amphibians have been vanishing worldwide over the past few decades.
Frogs are considered a key sentinel for effects of environmental degradation because they undergo a vulnerable time of metamorphosis and spend most of their time in water, where pollutants accumulate.
Frogs with both male and female reproductive organs were rare in the 19th century and early 20th century but abundant during the 1950s, when the largest volumes of the popular chemicals were used.
Studying endocrine disruption of animals dating back over a century is novel.
For two decades, scientists have been trying to figure out why amphibian populations worldwide are vanishing.
