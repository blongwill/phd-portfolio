A statement by Labor foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd said Friday's court ruling "has confirmed the Howard governments spineless and hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary".
It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.
New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."
