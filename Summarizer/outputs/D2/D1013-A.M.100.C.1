The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
There is now a support group called Victims of Identity Theft (310-397-3004).
``Back in 1988 when it happened (to me), nobody even knew what I was talking about,'' said Elsie Strong of Los Angeles, founder of the support group Victims of Identity Theft.
She has created an ``Identity Theft Survival Kit,'' written a book and pamphlets, and produced computer discs with sample letters to send to banks, creditors and credit reporting agencies.
Identity theft wasn't always so well-known, though.
Identity theft is a crime that evolves with every advance in technology.
