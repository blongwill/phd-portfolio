On Saturday night -- in a scene that seemed to sum up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy -- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge, and the father of one of four detained suspects in the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.
The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
