The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
Merck, which knew Vioxx was in competition with similar drugs, then conducted further trials, largely to find out if Vioxx could be legitimately recommended for other conditions.
That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it.
By contrast, Vioxx made $2.5 billion for Merck last year.
