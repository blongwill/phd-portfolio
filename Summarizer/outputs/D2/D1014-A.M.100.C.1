Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.
Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and about 33 percent suffered diabetes.
However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public to change lifestyles, following government health education.
Zhong Yukun, a nutrition expert of the Guangzhou Science and Technology Association, blamed unbalanced and dull food eaten every day for the malnutrition-based health problems.
