Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
Food that contains the substance is not allowed to be sold or exported, a statement from the Chinese agency said.
The advice came after Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA) last week issued a warning that some 350 food products may be affected and should be withdrawn from the shelves.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
