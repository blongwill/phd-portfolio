Tropical Cyclone Sidr, hovering over the Bay of Bengal, was moving towards Bangladesh's southern coastal districts, on the border with India, and likely to hit land later Thursday, said Bazlur Rashid of the Bangladesh weather department.
Cyclone Sidr, described as the worst storm in years to hit low-lying and disaster-prone Bangladesh, crashed into the southwestern coast Thursday night before sweeping north over the capital Dhaka.
The eye of cyclone Sidr, visible in satellite images as a colossal swirling white mass racing north from the Bay of Bengal, hit land in an impoverished coastal area near Bangladesh's border with India.
