The violent collapse at a site.
The collapse Saturday of the 205-foot crane -- described by city and union officials as one of the worst crane accidents in memory -- gave rise to a grim New York City parlor game, one : If that crane over there fell, where would it hit?
On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 E. 51st St., saying workers were "jumping" the crane -- intricately adding sections to raise the crane higher -- when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the side of the building fell.
