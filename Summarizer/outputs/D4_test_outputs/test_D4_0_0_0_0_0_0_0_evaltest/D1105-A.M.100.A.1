A Boeing 737-400 plane with 102 people on board crashed into a mountain in Indonesia's West Sulawesi province on Monday, killing at least 90 people.
Three Americans were among the 102 passengers and crew on board an Adam Air plane which crashed into a remote mountainous region of Indonesia, an airline official said Tuesday.
The wreckage of the ill-fated plane was found early Tuesday.
The Indonesian Navy (TNI AL) has sent two Cassa planes to carry the bodies of five of its members who were killed in a plane crash in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi late Monday.
