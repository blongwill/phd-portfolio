"So we studied 1,000 people who already had heart disease, and we were interested in determining whether we could predict who would go on to have another heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or die," she said.
"We need to increase public awareness for congenital heart disease in order to be able to better care for the increasing number of young people with heart disease," Marelli said.
"That is a surprise."
Congenital heart disease (CHD) has become more prevalent among adults as well as children, according to a latest study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.
