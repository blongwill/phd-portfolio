Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming.
The scientists "will not be speaking on or responding to these issues" of climate change, polar bears and sea ice, the memos say.
In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout their range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use as for seal hunting.
Department of Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in December proposed listing polar bears as a "threatened" species instead.
