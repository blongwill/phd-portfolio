On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 E. 51st St., saying workers were "jumping" the crane -- intricately adding sections to raise the crane higher -- when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the side of the building fell.
But when one of them collapsed on the East Side on Saturday -- killing at least four people, demolishing a building and damaging at least five others -- the disaster exposed the often-uneasy relationship cranes have had with the New Yorkers who walk below them.
The crane split into pieces.
