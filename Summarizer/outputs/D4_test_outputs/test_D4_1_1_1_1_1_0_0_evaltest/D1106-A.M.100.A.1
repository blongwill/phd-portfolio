Representatives, including the commercial fishing industry, government regulators and environmental groups, plan to discuss ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to better manage tuna stock and adopt an action plan, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.
Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring fishermen -- not -- worldwide to produce certificates of origin for tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market, Sakamoto said.
Doing so would help clamp down on excessive or illegal fishing, it said.
