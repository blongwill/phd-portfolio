British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the security threat level to "critical".
Britain's senior police officer said here on Saturday night that the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to events in London where two car bombs were defused on Friday.
The links related to the way the London car bombs and Glasgow airport attack had been conceived and planned, using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.
Glasgow Airport was evacuated and closed.
The incident came.
