The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.
Roxanne Dey, a National Park Service spokeswoman for the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, says that believe it or not, the drought has had at least one positive impact: "It reminds people here that we live in a desert."
Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
Its reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are drying, leaving accusatory rings on the shorelines and imperiling river-rafting companies.
