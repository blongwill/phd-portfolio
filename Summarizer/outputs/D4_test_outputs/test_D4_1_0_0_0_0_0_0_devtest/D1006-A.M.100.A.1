With Vioxx, researchers had been warning about the drug's possible cardiovascular risks since 2000, only a year after it was approved by the FDA.
The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps in the colon.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
