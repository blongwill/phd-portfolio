Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and leaving hundreds missing, officials said Sunday.
Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
Australia Sunday sent three Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night.
