The secretaries of the Army and Navy announced they had begun a broader review of Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center and announced that an independent review group will be formed to investigate outpatient care and administrative processes.
The Washington Post reported Sunday and Monday on the challenges facing outpatients at Walter Reed.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved'' in the problems have been removed from their positions.
