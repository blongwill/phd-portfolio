Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by police in Las Vegas over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room, police said Friday.
The charges against Simpson will include robbery with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a firearm, all felonies, Dillon said.
Simpson was arrested Sunday and faces multiple felony charges in an alleged armed robbery of collectors involving the former football great's sports memorabilia, authorities said.
"The victim stated that one of the suspects was OJ Simpson."
James Dillon said.
Two men with Simpson pulled guns during the robbery, Beardsley said.
