An unknown number of cats and dogs suffered kidney failure, and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, Menu Foods said in announcing the North American recall.
A major manufacturer of dog and cat food sold under Wal-Mart, Safeway, Kroger and other store brands recalled 60 million containers of wet pet food Friday after reports of kidney failure and deaths.
Two other pet food companies -- that makes the Science Diet brand -- recalled some of their products that were made by Menu Foods.
Menu Foods, said.
We are angry.
I've done so much research on pet food.
