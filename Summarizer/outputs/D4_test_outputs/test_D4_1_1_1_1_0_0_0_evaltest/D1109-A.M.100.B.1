One Israeli woman was killed and at least eight others wounded on Monday in a suicide bombing which ripped through a commercial center in the southern Israeli town of Dimona, the first attack of the kind since January 2007.
Hamas referred to the Dimona attack as "a heroic act," which is "a natural response to the crimes of the occupation."
People are panicking.
The "Army of Palestine" wing of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack in Dimona along with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , according to local Channel 2 Television.
