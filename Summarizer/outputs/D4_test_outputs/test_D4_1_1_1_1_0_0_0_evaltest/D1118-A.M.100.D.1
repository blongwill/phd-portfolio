As gunshots rang out over Christmas music, those at the mall huddled in dressing rooms and barricaded themselves in offices as the shooter, 19-year-old Robert A. Hawkins, sprayed the third floor of Von Maur with gunfire.
Robert A. Hawkins had recently split with his girlfriend and been fired from his job at McDonald's.
Hawkins opened fire in a Von Maur store.
She then called Hawkins' mother.
Thomas Warren, Omaha's police chief, told reporters that Robert A. Hawkins, 19, of Bellevue, Neb., came into the store and looked around before leaving and returning with an assault rifle to open fire.
