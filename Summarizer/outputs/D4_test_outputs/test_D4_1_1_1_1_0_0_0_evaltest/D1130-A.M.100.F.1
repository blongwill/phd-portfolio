Fishermen and search and rescue teams have thus far found around 200 survivors following the sinking of the ferry off the coast of Java late Friday with some 600 on board, officials said.
"I saw the ferry sink in about 10 minutes," Tanoto told ElShinta radio.
Nearly 200 have been found alive since the ferry sinking and authorities say they will keep searching until Sunday.
Many were still trapped in the ferry.
Navy ships are still searching now.
The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
