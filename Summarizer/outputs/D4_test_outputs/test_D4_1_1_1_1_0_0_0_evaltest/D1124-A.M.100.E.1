An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.
A key railway line threatened by a massive "mud volcano" which has forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Indonesian island of Java will be relocated, officials said Tuesday.
It concludes that the quake was not to blame, mainly because two days elapsed before mud volcano erupted, and no other mud volcanoes occurred in the region after the temblor.
