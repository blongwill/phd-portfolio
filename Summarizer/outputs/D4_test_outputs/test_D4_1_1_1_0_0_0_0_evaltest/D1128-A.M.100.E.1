In a pre-trial hearing of the case before the Special Court for Sierra Leone , Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his client was concerned he was being "short-changed" with only two attorneys who can attend his trial against a prosecution legal team of at least 10 people.
The trial is expected to start June 4 in The Hague, Netherlands.
He faces a life sentence if convicted.
The defence of Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor, whose war crimes trial is set to start Monday, has "fully adequate resources," the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone said here Wednesday.
