A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's.
WHAT'S NEXT: "What we did was just a snapshot of what actually happened" when people were deprived of sleep, but the "Holy Grail" of all sleep researchers, Yoo said, is to figure out what's really going on during sleep.
"It was like punishment," he says.
A separate study released in June by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that chronic sleep deprivation adds stress to the heart, putting a person at greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
