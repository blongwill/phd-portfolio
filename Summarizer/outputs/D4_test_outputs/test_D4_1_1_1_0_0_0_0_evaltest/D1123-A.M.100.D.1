It was the first major attack against a U.S. target in more than a decade, following the arrest of members of Greece's far-left November 17 terrorist group.
The United States said Friday it was unaware of any international involvement in a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Greece, but the investigation was in its early stages.
"We're treating it as a very serious attack."
Police have responded.
McCormack said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called US Ambassador Charles Ries earlier in the day and that Greece's foreign minister, Dora Bakoyannis, met with Ries shortly after the attack.
