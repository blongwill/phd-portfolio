Thursday's toy recall follows the June recall by RC2 Corp. of 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway product line because of lead paint.
About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.
Those toys were also made in China.
It is a big concern.
According to RC2, the recalled toys account for only 4 percent of its wooden railway units sold in the United States, although it declined to say how many Thomas &amp; Friends toys it produces annually.
