In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs.
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday.
they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
It is as if the reefs have been bleached.
"But there can't be recovery."
