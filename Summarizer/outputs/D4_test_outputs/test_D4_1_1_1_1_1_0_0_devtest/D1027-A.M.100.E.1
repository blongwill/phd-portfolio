The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Seven people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face the death penalty.
