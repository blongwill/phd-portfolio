A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.
People can't sleep.
On Wednesday, investigators brought in from Holland and police using a German Shepherd searched the van der Sloots' one-story, yellow-beige home, where Joran lived in an attached apartment.
