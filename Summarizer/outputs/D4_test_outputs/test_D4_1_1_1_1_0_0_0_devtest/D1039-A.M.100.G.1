The suspect in the murder of film maker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, had ties with a group of extremist Muslims monitored by the intelligence services, the Dutch government said here late Tuesday.
Some 20,000 people gathered in Amsterdam late Tuesday to pay homage to controversial Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh who was murdered in the street.
Many immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, and the assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
