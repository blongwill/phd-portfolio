Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
This plan doesn't do it.
Cultural incongruities abound.
If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
