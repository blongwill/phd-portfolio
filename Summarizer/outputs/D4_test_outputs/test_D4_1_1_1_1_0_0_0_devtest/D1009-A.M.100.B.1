John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
The Ramseys and their two children were the only people known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder, 18 months ago.
A Denver newspaper also headlined last week: ``Ramsey Family DNA Sought.''
In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old brother.
