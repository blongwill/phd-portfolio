But two species of coral last year were listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act.
On Wednesday the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species had placed 26 species in the Corallium genus on its Appendix II, protecting them from the unregulated trade which has decimated coral stocks around the world.
Delegates at the triennial meeting of the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species put the coral on a list of protected wildlife, meaning exporters will now have to prove that the coral was harvested without threatening the species' survival before they can sell it.
