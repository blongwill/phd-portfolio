A key railway line threatened by a massive "mud volcano" which has forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Indonesian island of Java will be relocated, officials said Tuesday.
An Indonesian environmental watchdog said it had filed suit on Monday against a mining company and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono over a "mud volcano".
Indonesian authorities Wednesday postponed the start of an attempt.
An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.
