Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved'' in the problems have been removed from their positions.
The secretaries of the Army and Navy announced they had begun a broader review of Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center and announced that an independent review group will be formed to investigate outpatient care and administrative processes.
``I do not think,'' Kiley said.
We get concerns.
The army also is investigating allegations.
