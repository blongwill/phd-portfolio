British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the security threat level to "critical".
Senior police officers said the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to the incident in London.
Glasgow Airport was evacuated and closed after a burning car crashed into the main terminal building on Saturday afternoon.
The incident came.
The links related to the way the London car bombs and Glasgow airport attack had been conceived and planned, using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.
