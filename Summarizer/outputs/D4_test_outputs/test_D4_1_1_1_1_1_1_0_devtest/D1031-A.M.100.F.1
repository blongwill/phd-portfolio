The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.

"This is likely to lead to further pressure on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier this week.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
