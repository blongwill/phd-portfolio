The Greek government on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca to Athens International Airport.
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
