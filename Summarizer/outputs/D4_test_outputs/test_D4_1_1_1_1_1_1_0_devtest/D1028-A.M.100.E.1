Jury selection for the trial of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in Sacramento, California.
A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
Lawyers are set to make opening statements Monday in trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski.
