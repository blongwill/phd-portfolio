During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan.
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
