A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
the experts said.
A year earlier, another Helios plane suffered engine problems.
