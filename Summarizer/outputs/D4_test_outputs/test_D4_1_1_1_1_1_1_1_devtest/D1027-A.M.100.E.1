The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard will begin with jury selection March 24.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant.
