Jury selection for the trial of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in Sacramento, California.
A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
The UNABOMber was so named.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
