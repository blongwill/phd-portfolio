The World Conservation lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.
Jeff George, curator at Sea Turtle Inc., a nonprofit turtle rescue group on South Padre Island, said 42 of the endangered juvenile green turtles were released Tuesday and 46 on Wednesday.
Rapid development endangers the turtles, too.
Three species of turtle -- the Olive Ridley, Hawksbill and the critically endangered Leatherback -- lay their eggs on the contiguous beaches of Litibu, Malinal, Punta Negra and Careyeros, a two-mile stretch of rapidly developing white beach and rock outcrops in the Mexican state of Nayarit.
