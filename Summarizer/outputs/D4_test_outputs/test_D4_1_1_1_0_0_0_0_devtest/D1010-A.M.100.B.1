A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
