The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
I did have a patient who said, 'I've heard about Vioxx, I hear Celebrex is next.'
"He did so voluntarily," the agency said.
"I believe this is a class effect," he said, meaning the problem that caused Vioxx to be removed also could apply to Celebrex and Pfizer's newer and similar drug, Bextra.
