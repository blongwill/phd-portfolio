Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
"There is no risk of immediate ill health," Bell said.
Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
