LOS ANGELES - The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was "violent" and "dangerous" and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 29, was convicted last month at Los Angeles Superior Court following a two-month trial.
"It feels," she said.
Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
