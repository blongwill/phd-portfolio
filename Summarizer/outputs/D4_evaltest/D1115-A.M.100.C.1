The previously largest oil spill in South Korea happened in 1995 when about 5,035 tons -- about 35,000 barrels -- of crude and fuel oil was leaked, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
South Korea's Coast Guard said Friday it stopped oil leaking from a supertanker in seas near South Korea's west coast and was cleaning up what appeared to be the country's largest offshore spill.
A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea Friday after being holed by a barge in what officials said was South Korea's worst oil spill.
