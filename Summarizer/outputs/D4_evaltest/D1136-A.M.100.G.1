The Three Gorges Dam in central China's Hubei Province Thursday has opened its floodgates to ease the severe water shortages along the Yangtze River.
Experts estimate that the water shortage will not be alleviated until March.
Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, over the last two weeks, leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages, local water authorities said on Monday.
Sources with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation said the water shortage in the upper reaches had not affected the world's largest water storage facility.
