Participants are seeking to create a framework -- worldwide to produce certificates of origin for tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market, Sakamoto said.
The five-day meeting in the western Japanese city of Kobe will look at ways to share information among regions to monitor tuna numbers and control illegal fishing vessels, officials said.
Representatives, including the commercial fishing industry, government regulators and environmental groups, plan to better manage tuna stock and adopt an action plan, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.
