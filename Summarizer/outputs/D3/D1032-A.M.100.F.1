The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day.
"The situation is still serious," Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for the Norwegian oil group Statoil which operates the Snorre A offshore platform, told AFP.
