White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old brother.
The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
Police say her parents, John and  Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion.
The Ramseys have denied any involvement in their daughter's death.
A Denver newspaper also headlined last week: ``Ramsey Family DNA Sought.''
