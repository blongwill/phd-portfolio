The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
"He did so voluntarily," the agency said.
With Vioxx, researchers had been warning about the drug's possible cardiovascular risks since 2000, only a year after it was approved by the FDA.
"I believe this is a class effect," he said, meaning the problem that caused Vioxx to be removed also could apply to Celebrex and Pfizer's newer and similar drug, Bextra.
