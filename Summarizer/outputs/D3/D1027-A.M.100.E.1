(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
They replied, ``No.''
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him.
