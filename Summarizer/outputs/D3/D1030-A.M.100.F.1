Products containing ephedrine _ commonly labeled as ephedra, ma huang Chinese ephedra, and epitonin _ are often found in weight-loss, energy boosting, and body building supplements.
Ephedra's active ingredient, ephedrine, has been in over-the-counter cold and asthma medications since the 1920s, and the ephedra plant has been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine.
The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a shrublike plant grown widely in Asia.
The patients later said they had been taking ephedra.
Ephedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved for use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some pharmaceutical products.
