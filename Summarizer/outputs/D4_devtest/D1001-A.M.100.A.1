The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams counted some victims more than once.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
