In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster.
It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
Baker said these findings suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event, heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them.
"But there can't be recovery."
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union said Friday.
