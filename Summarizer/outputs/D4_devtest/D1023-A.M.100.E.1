At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
Austrian soldiers took advantage of a break in heavy snowfall today to mount a rescue of avalanche victims from a stricken Alpine town, joining villagers.
Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in by helicopter.
