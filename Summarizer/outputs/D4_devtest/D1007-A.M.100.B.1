In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
