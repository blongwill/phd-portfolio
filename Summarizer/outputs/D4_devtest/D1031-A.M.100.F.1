The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
Environment Program says.
But others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.
